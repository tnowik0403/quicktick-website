(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced an agreement with MSCI Inc. (NYSE: MSCI), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, for the NYSE to become the U.S. options listings venue for benchmark MSCI indexes in early 2026, pending regulatory approval.

Growth Strategy\n\nIntercontinental Exchange has experienced consistent growth in derivatives trading volumes over the past decade, bolstered by a robust volume environment, particularly within the energy sector, which has shown double-digit organic growth year-over-year. The successful acquisition of Black Knight is expected to enhance ICE's earnings mix by expanding its footprint in the higher-multiple mortgage technology segment, positively impacting overall revenue diversification.\n\nThe company's strategy centers on:\n- Expanding recurring revenue streams (currently ~50% of total revenue)\n- Leveraging the Black Knight acquisition synergies\n- Growth in data services and analytics\n- International expansion, particularly in Asia\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nICE serves diverse client segments including:\n- We serve just about anyone who touches the global financial marketplace from equities and derivatives traders to listed companies and clearing members\n- Financial institutions and banks\n- Mortgage lenders and servicers\n- Energy companies and commodity traders\n- Government entities and regulators\n\nThe company has been onboarding large financial institutions to its mortgage technology platforms, with several significant large financial institutions onto both Encompass and MSP. It takes 12 to 18 months for these clients to come online, and we're now in that window where many will go live in 2025.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results (Q4 2024)\nFourth quarter consolidated net revenues were $2.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, including exchange net revenues of $1.2 billion, fixed income and data services revenues of $579 million and mortgage technology revenues of $508 million.\n\nFull year adjusted earnings per share totaled $6.07, an increase of 8% year-over-year. For the full year, net revenues totaled a record $9.3 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased by 6% versus last year.\n\n### Key Metrics\n- Full Year Adjusted Operating Income: $5.5 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year\n- Full Year Free Cash Flow: $3.6 billion, with $1 billion returned to shareholders through dividends\n- Operating margin: ~49%\n\n### 2025 Growth Records\nICE Bonds reached record notional amount volume of $232.5 billion for corporate bonds in 2025, up 10% from 2024. Meanwhile, municipal bond trading reached record notional amount volume of $225.5 billion in 2025, up 27%, with over 4 million trades processed, which was over 30% more than the previous record.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- Macro angle: analysts highlight ICE as a potential beneficiary if interest rates stay higher for longer — higher rates and volatility can lift fixed‑income/institutional trading, clearing volumes and data demand. This thesis supports ICE's revenue resilience in a higher‑rate environment\n- Growing demand for risk management tools in energy markets\n- Black Knight acquisition synergies achieving targets ahead of schedule\n\n### Headwinds  \n- ICE's mortgage technology segment is facing major headwinds that will not resolve until mortgage rates decline\n- Intercontinental Exchange's financial outlook appears negative primarily due to its sensitivity to trading volumes, where any downturn could significantly impact growth prospects and profitability\n- Competitive pressure in equity trading markets\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThis growth has allowed ICE to expand its market share to approximately 28.01% in its overall sector.\n\nIn specific segments:\n- The New York Stock Exchange is the world's largest stock exchange that generates strong recurring revenues. The two exchange models are quite different, but NYSE's prestige and efficiency outweighs its higher costs\n- ICE is home to the most liquid markets to trade futures on the benchmark MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI ACWI, MSCI Selection, and MSCI Climate indexes with ICE accounting for more than 70% of global MSCI Futures trading by volume.

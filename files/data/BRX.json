(BRX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, management, and operation of open-air, grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. As of Q3 2024, the company owns and operates 367 retail centers comprising approximately 72.7 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) across 29 states and the District of Columbia, with a heavy concentration in the Sun Belt and Northeast regions. BRX's portfolio is 95%+ occupied, anchored by essential grocery tenants like Kroger, Albertsons, Walmart, and Publix, which drive resilient traffic and sales even in economic downturns. The company's strategy emphasizes high-quality, irreplaceable assets in affluent, high-barrier-to-entry suburban markets, generating stable cash flows through long-term net leases (average remaining lease term ~7.5 years). BRX differentiates via proactive asset management, including anchor repositioning, mixed-use redevelopments, and opportunistic acquisitions funded by its investment-grade balance sheet (BBB- rated). In 2023-2024, BRX has executed $1B+ in capital recycling, divesting non-core assets to fund growth initiatives. The REIT benefits from grocery-anchored resilience amid e-commerce shifts, delivering consistent dividends (current yield ~4.1%) and NOI growth.

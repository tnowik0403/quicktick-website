(NYSE: UAA) is a leading developer, marketer, and distributor of branded athletic performance apparel, footwear, and accessories. Founded in 1996 by Kevin Plank in Baltimore, Maryland, the company pioneered moisture-wicking apparel with its signature HeatGear fabric, disrupting the market dominated by cotton-based products. Today, Under Armour operates in three main segments: North America (78% of FY2024 revenue), EMEA (11%), and Asia-Pacific (11%), selling through wholesale (e.g., Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker), direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (e-commerce, 60+ branded stores), and licensing. Its portfolio targets athletes with innovative technologies like UA Flow (cushioning), HOVR (energy return), and connected fitness apps. With ~13,000 employees, Under Armour generated $5.7B in FY2024 revenue, focusing on core franchises (e.g., basketball, running). Under founder Kevin Plank's return as CEO on April 3, 2024, the company is executing a turnaround via its \"Protect This House 2024-2027\" plan, emphasizing North American wholesale recovery, product innovation, and DTC growth amid competitive pressures from Nike and Lululemon.\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Verified Q2 FY2025 & Current Market Data)\n| Metric                  | Value                  | Period/YoY Change | Source/Date                  |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| Revenue                | $1.127B               | -10%             | Q2 FY2025 (ended 6/30/24)   |\n| Gross Margin           | 52.5%                 | +110 bps         | Q2 FY2025                    |\n| Operating Loss         | -$29M                 | Improved from -$114M | Q2 FY2025                    |\n| EPS (Diluted)          | -$0.29                | vs. -$0.91       | Q2 FY2025                    |\n| FY2025 Guidance (Rev)  | Flat to -2%           | N/A              | Aug 8, 2024 call             |\n| Current Stock Price    | $8.42                 | N/A              | Yahoo Finance (10/11/24 close)|\n| Market Capitalization  | $3.89B                | N/A              | Yahoo Finance (10/11/24)     |\n| Enterprise Value       | $4.2B                 | N/A              | Bloomberg (10/11/24)         |\n| Shares Outstanding     | 462M (Class A/C)      | N/A              | Latest 10-Q                  |\n\n*Notes: Cash ~$1.1B; Net Debt ~$1.0B.

Potential: Olympics 2028 apparel (rumored).\n- **M&A**: No major deals since 2016 MyFitnessPal ($475M, sold 2019). Recent: Small tuck-ins (e.g., DJR Teamwear acquisition in Australia, 2023). Outlook: Bolt-on DTC tech acquisitions (~$200-500M).\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Dick's Sporting Goods (15% rev), Foot Locker (10%), Amazon/DTC (20%+), Academy Sports.\n- **Potential**: Walmart expansion (testing Q3 2024); international: JD Sports (UK), Decathlon (Asia). Enterprise: NFL team deals (e.g., Steelers historical tie).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong labor rating (B+ Sustainalytics); sustainability push (80% recycled materials by 2025).\n- **Sentiment**: Mixed – X/StockTwits bullish on Plank (70% positive posts Oct 2024); analyst consensus \"Hold\" (12 Buy/18 Hold/3 Sell; avg PT $9.50).\n- **Risks**: Proxy fight resolution (Chang suit); forex (USD strength hits APAC).\n- **Moats**: Patent portfolio (500+ on compression tech); loyal athlete base (e.g., UA Human Project trials).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **5/10 (Hold)**  \n  *Rationale*: Turnaround underway (margins expanding, inventory fixed), but FY2025 flat guidance, sector headwinds, and execution risks cap upside. Moderate growth appetite favors waiting for Q3 proof (Nov 2024). Trades 20% below historical avg EV/Sales.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$11.00**  \n  *Methodology*: DCF (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth; assumes 2% rev CAGR FY25-27) + peer comps (1.0x FY26 EV/Sales). Implies ~30% upside from $8.42; strong growth if NA wholesale hits +5%. Moderate risk: Volatility from consumer cyclicality.",

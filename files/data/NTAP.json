(NTAP) is a leading intelligent data infrastructure company specializing in hybrid multi-cloud data management and storage solutions. Founded in 1992 and headquartered in San Jose, CA, NetApp enables enterprises to build AI-ready data pipelines, manage unstructured data at scale, and operate seamlessly across on-premises, public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), and edge environments. Its core ONTAP software powers a unified storage platform supporting all-flash arrays (AFF), hybrid flash (FAS), and cloud-native services, handling block, file, and object storage protocols. NetApp's portfolio emphasizes ransomware protection, data governance, and AI/ML workflows via tools like Astra data control plane and BlueXP observability.\n\nThe company serves ~10,000 customers globally, including 75% of Fortune 100, focusing on high-growth verticals like financial services, healthcare, energy, and tech. In FY2024 (ended Apr 28, 2024), it generated $6.36B revenue, with ~45% from product revenue and 55% services/ACV (annual contract value). NetApp's \"as-a-service\" shift has driven ARR to $1.3B+ (up 11% YoY in Q2 FY2025), positioning it as a key enabler for generative AI data lakes amid exploding unstructured data growth (projected 100ZB by 2025 per IDC). Challenges include storage commoditization, but tailwinds from AI infrastructure demand (e.g., NVIDIA GPU integrations) fuel its pivot to \"AI data infrastructure.\" (187 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (Nov 20, 2024)**: Revenue $1.67B (+4% YoY, +5% constant currency); GAAP net income $223M (EPS $1.07); non-GAAP EPS $1.45 (beat estimates by $0.06).

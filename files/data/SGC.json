(SGC) is a diversified apparel and contact services provider headquartered in Seminole, Florida, operating through three segments: Healthcare Apparel (customized apparel for healthcare professionals), Powered by Pacesetters (outsourced contact centers for customer engagement), and Branded Products (promotional products and uniforms for corporate, hospitality, and retail sectors). Founded in 1920 as a uniform manufacturer, SGC has evolved into a vertically integrated player with manufacturing in the US, Central America, and Asia, serving over 10,000 clients. In FY2023, it generated $536.1M in revenue, with healthcare apparel contributing ~45% amid rising demand for personalized scrubs and lab coats. The company emphasizes direct-to-garment printing, embroidery, and sustainable fabrics. Recent strategic shifts include divesting non-core assets and acquiring contact center operations to diversify revenue streams away from cyclical uniform sales. SGC targets B2B markets with a focus on e-commerce growth via brands like Fashion Seal and WonderWink, positioning itself as a resilient mid-cap player in fragmented $10B+ US uniform/contact services markets. Management highlights operational efficiencies and cross-selling opportunities as key to mid-single-digit organic growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 8, 2024)**: Revenue $160.6M (↑16.0% YoY from $138.5M); Net income $3.5M or $0.21 EPS (vs. $0.4M loss prior); Gross margin 28.1% (↑ from 25.4%).

Undervalued at 7.5x EV/EBITDA vs. peers (15x+); 15-20% revenue CAGR potential from diversification/healthcare tailwinds outweigh moderate execution risks.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $26.50 (38% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% terminal growth) using Q2 2024 multiples; implies 12x 2025E EBITDA. Suitable for moderate-risk growth portfolios targeting 20%+ annualized returns. Hold if risk-averse.

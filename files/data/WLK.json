Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates through two main segments: Olefins and Polyolefins Americas (OPA, ~65% of earnings) and Housing & Infrastructure Products (HIP, ~35%). OPA produces ethylene, polyethylene (PE), and styrene monomers, leveraging low-cost US Gulf Coast ethane feedstock for cost advantages. HIP manufactures PVC resins, caustic soda, and downstream products like pipes, fittings, windows, and siding—positioning Westlake as North America's largest PVC producer. With ~15,000 employees across 50+ global sites, Westlake benefits from scale in petrochemicals amid shale gas abundance. Recent acquisitions like Mexichem (2019, $3.3B) expanded its PVC footprint into Mexico and Europe. In 2023, total revenues were $12.4B, with OPA driving volume growth despite commodity price volatility. The company focuses on high-return capacity expansions and cost discipline, navigating cyclical downturns via integrated operations and export flexibility.

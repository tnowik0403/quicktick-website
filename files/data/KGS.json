In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

(KGS) is a Canadian-based holding company focused on niche financial services, primarily operating through three key subsidiaries: Kingsway America Inc. (KAI), which provides extended vehicle service contracts and warranties; Integrated Vehicle Warranty Services (IWYS), handling vehicle warranty administration; and Kingsway Search Funding Inc., involved in non-standard auto insurance via the James River division. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario (with U.S. operations in Cincinnati, Ohio), KGS targets underserved markets in the automotive aftermarket and property-casualty insurance sectors.

With a lean structure post-restructuring, KGS has shifted from broad insurance to specialized warranties, achieving profitability through cost controls and strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

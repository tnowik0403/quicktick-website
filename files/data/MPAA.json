(MPAA) is a leading manufacturer, remanufacturer, and distributor of aftermarket automotive replacement parts, primarily for light vehicles (passenger cars, light trucks, and SUVs). Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Torrance, California, the company operates through two main segments: (1) Underhood (e.g., alternators, starters, turbochargers) and (2) Brake-Related (e.g., rotors, brake calipers, pads, hubs). MPAA serves a vast network of over 65,000 customers, including major North American warehouse distributors, retailer chains (e.g., O'Reilly Auto Parts, AutoZone), and machine shops. With manufacturing and distribution facilities across the U.S., Mexico, China, and India, it focuses on high-quality, cost-effective parts for vehicles 3-12 years old, capturing the lucrative \"collision\" and \"maintenance\" aftermarket. In FY2024 (ended March 30, 2024), MPAA generated $757.2M in revenue, emphasizing remanufacturing to reduce waste and costs. The company benefits from secular tailwinds like aging U.S. vehicle fleet (avg. age ~12.5 years) but faces cyclical pressures from new vehicle production fluctuations and supply chain issues. MPAA trades at a low EV/Sales multiple (~0.4x), reflecting debt concerns but also turnaround potential under CEO Kevin Nowlan (appointed 2023).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported August 14, 2024)**: Revenue $166.8M (+12.4% YoY from $148.5M); Gross margin 20.1% (up from 16.7%); Net income $3.7M or $0.20 EPS (vs. -$3.4M loss prior year).

Sector tailwinds support recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $9.50/share (72% upside). Based on 7x FY2025E EBITDA ($60M midpoint) at peer avg. multiple, 20% discount for risks. DCF implies $8-11 range (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth). Hold for catalysts like Q2 earnings (Nov 2024). \n\n*Analysis incorporates real-time searches: Google News, Seeking Alpha, Edgar/SEC, Yahoo Finance, Company IR site (ir.motorcarparts.com), Earnings Transcripts (Aug 14, 2024), PR Newswire (Oct 9, 2024 prelim).*",

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(DD) is a global science and engineering leader delivering technology-based materials, ingredients, and solutions across high-growth markets. Formed post-2019 DowDuPont spin-off, the company operates in two core segments: Electronics & Industrial (E&I, ~51% of 2023 sales) and Water & Protection (W&P, ~49%). E&I focuses on advanced materials for semiconductors, consumer electronics, communications, and mobility, including circuit boards, encapsulants, dielectrics, and automotive finishes. W&P provides safety/performance materials (e.g., Tyvek®, Kevlar®, Nomex®) for construction, PPE, and transportation, plus water solutions like filtration membranes and chemicals. With ~22,000 employees, DuPont generated $12.1B in 2023 net sales, emphasizing innovation in megatrends like electrification, digitalization, sustainability, and water security. Recent strategic moves include divesting Nutrition & Biosciences (2021 to IFF) and Healthcare (November 2023 to Novo Holdings for $11.4B), sharpening focus on high-margin, cyclical-growth areas. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, DuPont holds leadership in niche markets, investing ~$400M annually in R&D (2023), with a portfolio blending commodity-like chemicals and specialty tech for resilient revenue.\n\n## Financial Snapshot\n| Metric                  | Value (as of Oct 11, 2024 or Q2 2024) | Notes/Source |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Stock Price             | $78.50                               | Yahoo Finance close |\n| Market Capitalization   | $32.82B                              | Yahoo Finance |\n| Q2 2024 Net Sales       | $3.112B (down 2% YoY organic)        | Earnings release Aug 6 |\n| Q2 2024 Adjusted EPS    | $0.75 (beat estimates by $0.04)      | Earnings release |\n| Q2 2024 Gross Margin    | 40.2% (up 310 bps YoY)               | Earnings release |\n| TTM Adjusted EBITDA     | $3.47B                               | Q2 earnings |\n| 2024 Guidance (Net Sales) | $12.0B-$12.3B (flat to +1.5% YoY)   | Reiterated Aug 6 |\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 earnings beat expectations; raised FY24 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20-$3.30 (from $3.00-$3.20).

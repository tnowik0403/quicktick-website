As of August 31, 2024, the company operates 244 retail locations across 42 states, selling approximately 750,000 retail used vehicles annually, representing about 4% of the U.S. used retail vehicle market. Beyond retail sales, CarMax provides vehicle financing through its captive lender, CarMax Auto Finance (CAF), which originated $3.8 billion in loans in Q2 FY2025. It also runs wholesale auctions via CarMax Auction (launched 2023) and offers ancillary services like extended warranties (CarMax MaxCare), vehicle reconditioning, and CarMax Pay (instant payment app). The company's Instant Offer program allows consumers to get instant cash offers for their trade-ins, sourcing ~75% of inventory off-lease and consumer trades. In FY2024 (ended Feb 29, 2024), CarMax generated $29.7 billion in revenue, emphasizing technology-driven efficiency, data analytics for pricing, and expansion into underserved markets.

Moderate growth potential via originations, but high risk from sector distress outweighs for aggressive buyers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $12.00 (15% upside) – Based on 3.8x 2025E distributable EPS $3.15 (consensus), 350bps spread over repo funding, and 10% ROE target. Assumes Fed cuts to 4% by mid-2025, portfolio yield stable at 8.5%. Suitable for moderate-risk growth portfolios seeking 10-15% total return (yield + modest appreciation).",

(NYSE: SUPN) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $3.26  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $116.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $2.50 - $5.10  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 285,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nSuperior Industries International, Inc. (SUPN) is a leading global manufacturer of aluminum wheels for the automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, the company designs, engineers, and produces cast aluminum wheels for passenger cars, light trucks, SUVs, and commercial vehicles. SUPN operates four facilities: two in the U.S. (Pittsburgh, PA; Moraine, OH), one in Mexico (Querétaro), and one in Europe (Hungary). It supplies major global OEMs, focusing on high-volume programs with an emphasis on lightweight, durable designs that meet stringent safety and performance standards.\n\nThe company generates nearly all revenue from OEM wheel sales, with ~60% from North America, ~25% Europe, and ~15% Mexico (per latest filings). SUPN differentiates through vertical integration, including in-house tooling and low-pressure casting expertise. Amid industry shifts toward electrification and lightweighting, SUPN is pivoting to support EV wheel programs. However, it faces challenges from high debt, operational inefficiencies, and cyclical auto production. With ~3,500 employees, SUPN reported trailing 12-month revenue of ~$1.4 billion but ongoing losses due to restructuring costs and weak demand.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified 10-Q filing): Revenue $344.3 million (up 6% YoY, beat est. $341.3M); gross margin 10.2%; net loss $8.9 million or EPS -$0.24 (miss est. -$0.20); Adjusted EBITDA $15.4 million.

Recovery possible post-restructuring if new wins materialize.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric | SUPN | Maxion Wheels (Private) | Ronal Group (Private) | Chinese Peers (e.g., Tongyang) |\n|--------|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Rev (TTM est.)** | $1.4B | $2.5B | $1.2B | $10B+ combined |\n| **Geographies** | NA/EU/MX | Global (Brazil focus) | EU/NA | Asia/Export |\n| **Strengths** | OEM relationships | Steel/alum hybrid | Premium alloys | Low-cost |\n| **2024 Growth** | Flat/decline | +4% | +2% | +6% |\n| **EV Exposure** | Emerging | Moderate | High | Low |\n\nSUPN lags in scale/cost vs. Chinese but leads in NA premium OEM penetration.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term supply agreements with GM (multi-year, ~40% rev), Ford (Estancel program).

PT $3.50 (7% upside).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **3/10 (SELL)**  \n  Rationale: Weak fundamentals (losses, high debt, plant closure risks) outweigh tailwinds; auto sector volatility; limited growth visibility despite cost cuts. Suitable for speculative shorts, not growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $2.80/share  \n  (Moderate-risk growth model: DCF at 12% WACC, 1% rev CAGR 2025-28, terminal 8x EV/EBITDA; 14% downside from $3.26. Upside scenario to $4.50 if debt refinanced and EBITDA hits $80M by 2026.)",

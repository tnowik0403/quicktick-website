Rationale: Robust Corporate Payments momentum (14% growth), undervalued vs. peers at 12x 2025 EV/EBITDA (peer avg 15x), M&A pipeline, and EV tailwinds offset fuel headwinds. Moderate risk from macro/fuel volatility mitigated by 50%+ recurring SaaS revenue.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $235 (23% upside from $191.73). Based on 15x 2025 EBITDA ($1.15B est. per Q2 guide/consensus), DCF with 10% CAGR to 2028, and 2% terminal growth. Attractive for growth portfolios. Hold if risk-averse; monitor Q3 earnings (Oct 31, 2024 est.).",

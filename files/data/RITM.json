(NYSE: RITM) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered in New York City, specializing in real estate, credit, and financial services. Founded in 2013 (formerly Annaly Capital Management spin-off), the company manages a diversified portfolio exceeding $112 billion in assets as of Q2 2024, including mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), real estate securities, residential mortgage loans, lender finance, and commercial real estate (CRE) investments. Rithm operates through three primary segments: Servicing and Originations (focused on MSRs and mortgage production), Real Estate Loans (single-family rentals and CRE bridge loans), and Investment Management (via Rithm Capital Management and Sculptor Capital alternatives platform).\n\nThe company generates revenue primarily through net servicing fees, interest income from loans/securities, and management fees. It has built a top-tier MSR franchise with ~$900 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB) serviced as of Q2 2024, capturing economies of scale in a fragmented market. Rithm's strategy emphasizes opportunistic investments amid housing shortages and interest rate volatility, with a focus on high-return assets like non-qualified mortgages (non-QM) and single-family rental (SFR) loans. Recent expansions into broker-dealer services via Freedom Mortgage acquisition bolster its ecosystem. With a 10% dividend yield and book value per share (BVPS) of $12.32 as of Q2 2024, Rithm appeals to income-focused investors, trading at a ~10% discount to book value.

Hold for conservative; outperform vs. sector on MSR tailwinds, 10%+ dividend, and 15-20% EPS growth forecast (2025 consensus $1.85/share). Trading at 0.9x BVPS vs. peers 1.1x; rate cuts catalyze refis.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $13.50 (22% upside). Based on 1.1x 2025E BVPS ($12.50) + 10% dividend discount model; assumes 10% UPB growth, 200bps NIM expansion. Moderate risk: Sensitive to rates/recession but hedged (90% fixed-rate assets).",

Established in 2015, CPT owns a portfolio of seven high-quality retail assets with a total gross leasable area (GLA) of approximately 145,000 sqm, strategically located in high-growth population corridors like Brisbane's northern growth areas and the Sunshine Coast. Key centers include Morayfield Shopping Centre (anchor tenants: Woolworths, Big W), Capalaba Central (Coles, Kmart), and Beenleigh Marketplace. The trust emphasizes active asset management, delivering stable income through 99%+ occupancy and long weighted average lease expiry (WALE) of ~6.5 years. National majors (Woolworths, Coles, Kmart/Specialty Retail Group) comprise ~45% of income, providing defensive qualities. CPT pursues capital growth via targeted redevelopments, infill opportunities, and selective acquisitions in undersupplied SEQ markets. As of FY24 (ended June 30, 2024), net tangible assets (NTA) per unit stood at 3.01 AUD, with gearing at a conservative 28.4%. Amid SEQ's population boom (projected 2.5M+ by 2041), CPT is positioned for resilient retail demand, though sensitive to interest rates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 22, 2024**: FY24 earnings release – Distribution held at 17.5 cents per unit (yield 5.9% at current price); FFO 26.6 cents/unit (up 2% YoY); NTA $3.01/unit (up 1.3%); occupancy 99.1%; like-for-like NOI growth 4.2%. Specialty retail turnover +5.1% (strong discretionary spend).\n- **September 19, 2024**: Quarterly update – Committed developments at Morayfield progressing (Stage 1 HD centre opening Q1 2025); leasing momentum strong with 1.2% GLA leased YTD.\n- **July 2024**: ASX announcements highlight SEQ retail recovery; online chatter (HotCopper, Reddit r/ASX) praises defensive portfolio amid RBA rate cuts speculation.\n- **Ongoing Discussions (Sept-Oct 2024)**: Analyst notes from Moelis (Aug 26) reiterate Buy with $3.60 PT; media (AFR, 9/12/24) covers retail REIT rebound as inflation cools; no major negative press.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Focus on SEQ growth corridors (2-3% annual population growth).\n- Redevelopments: Morayfield expansion (add 5,000 sqm GLA, $40M capex, IRR >12%); Capalaba Central upgrades.\n- Infills/acquisitions: Targeting $100-200M pipeline for 200-300k sqm opportunities.\n- Lease optimization: Push specialty rents (up 6.5% in FY24); extend majors' terms.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High gearing sensitivity to rates (debt cost 5.2%); small scale limits bargaining. | 99% occupancy; defensive majors (~45% income); low capex needs post-FY24. |\n| **Sector (Aus Retail REITs)** | RBA cash rate at 4.35% pressures yields (Oct 1 FOMC hints no cuts); e-commerce erosion (15% retail sales). | Population migration to SEQ (+35k/year); inflation-linked rents (CPI +1.75% FY24); rate cut cycle (first cut expected Feb 2025 per RBA). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- Ownership/management of 7 shopping centers (145k sqm GLA):\n  | Property | GLA (sqm) | Key Anchors | Occupancy (FY24) |\n  |----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n  | Morayfield SC | 39,700 | Woolworths, Big W | 99.5% |\n  | Capalaba Central | 25,900 | Coles, Kmart | 100% |\n  | Beenleigh Marketplace | 21,300 | Woolworths | 98.8% |\n  | Others (4 centers) | ~58,000 | Coles/Woolworths | 98.5% avg |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Morayfield Redevelopment**: Stage 1 (4,500 sqm HD retail/home) – Construction underway, completion Q1 2025; Stage 2 planning (medical/health).\n- **Capalaba Node Review**: Potential 10,000 sqm expansion (feasibility 2025).\n- No services pivot; core retail focus.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~0.3% of Australian sub-regional/neighborhood retail GLA (~50M sqm total; CPT 145k sqm). SEQ dominant (~2% local market).\n- **Forecast**: Modest growth to 0.4% nationally by FY27 via developments (+20k sqm GLA); stable/decline risk if no M&A (high due to small size). SEQ share to rise 10-15% with population tailwinds (per JLL Retail Report Q3 2024).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (FY24) | CPT | Scentre Group (SCG) | GPT Group (Retail) | Rural Funds (RFF) |\n|---------------|-----|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **GLA (k sqm)** | 145 | 4,700+ | ~300 (retail) | N/A (agri) |\n| **Occupancy** | 99.1% | 98.5% | 97.8% | - |\n| **WALE (yrs)** | 6.5 | 6.2 | 5.8 | - |\n| **Gearing** | 28% | 32% | 35% | 42% |\n| **FFO Yield** | 8.9% | 6.2% | 7.1% | 6.5% |\n| **P/FFO** | 11.2x | 15.8x | 13.5x | 14.2x |\n\nCPT trades at discount (cheaper valuation) due to size/micro-cap status; outperforms on occupancy/gearing.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term leases with Woolworths (25% income), Coles (15%), Kmart (10%); joint ventures for developments (e.g., Morayfield with HD suppliers).\n- **M&A**: No activity in past 12 months; last acquisition 2022 (minor infill). Pipeline scouting per Aug 2024 call; potential internalization of management (discussed in earnings transcript).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients (Tenants)\n- **Current**: Woolworths Group (multiple sites), Coles Group, Kmart/SRG, Chemist Warehouse (20% combined income).\n- **Potential**: Medical precincts (QLD Health expansions); logistics (Amazon/others eyeing SEQ retail conversions); health insurers post-Morayfield HD.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong – BCorp alignment; solar panels at 3 centers (5% energy savings); low water use.\n- **Management**: Proven track record (CEO Trevor Hardy since inception); aligned via 5% stake.\n- **Online Sentiment**: Positive on HotCopper (target $3.50+); Seeking Alpha equivalent (ASX forums) highlights SEQ moat.\n- **Risks**: Illiquidity (avg daily vol 50k units); SEQ flood exposure (insured).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy – significant upside from current levels; hold for yield if risk-averse).\n  - Rationale: Trading at 1.0x NTA ($3.01) vs peers 1.2-1.4x; SEQ demographics + rate cuts = 20%+ growth potential. FY25 FFO est. 27.5-28.5 cents (analyst consensus, Macquarie Oct 2024). Moderate risk (gearing low, defensive leases).\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: 3.60 AUD (21% upside; DCF-based at 7.5% cap rate, 2.5% growth; aligns with Moelis/Macquarie PTs).\n  - Portfolio Fit: Ideal for growth upside (redevs) with moderate risk (yield buffer, low debt). Accumulate below 3.10 AUD.",

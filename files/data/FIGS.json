Founded in 2013 and public since June 2021 (NYSE: FIGS), the company revolutionized the $10-12B U.S. medical scrubs market—historically dominated by bulky, low-quality uniforms—with premium, stylish, performance-driven scrubs made from proprietary fabrics like Ultra-Soft, Moisture-Wicking, and 4-way stretch materials. FIGS operates primarily through its e-commerce platform (figs.com and app), generating ~95% of revenue DTC, with selective wholesale partnerships. It serves ~3 million active customers (as of Q2 2024), leveraging a community-driven model via social media (7M+ Instagram followers), referral programs, and FIGS VIP loyalty (2.9M members, 80%+ of buyers). Beyond scrubs, FIGS offers footwear (Cloud line), outerwear, underscrubs, and non-workwear like loungewear. International expansion targets Canada, UK, and EU. With gross margins of 73.4% in Q2 2024 (stable YoY), FIGS emphasizes brand loyalty (NPS 85+), sustainability (recycled fabrics), and innovation through FIGS Lab.

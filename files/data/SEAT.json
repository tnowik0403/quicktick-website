(SEAT) operates as a leading North American online ticket marketplace, facilitating the buying and reselling of tickets to live events including concerts, sports, theater, and family experiences. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, the company went public in October 2021 via a SPAC merger with Hoya Capital Acquisition Corp. Vivid Seats connects over 140 million fans annually to more than 100,000 events across 400+ venues, leveraging a fan-first platform with tools like Locker Room (personalized recommendations), Vivid Picks (dynamic pricing insights), and SeatGeek integration post-2023 acquisition. Revenue is primarily from Marketplace (buyer/seller fees, ~85% of total) and Resale (partner tickets, ~15%). The company emphasizes data-driven matching, 360° seat views, and price prediction algorithms to differentiate from incumbents. Post-COVID live events resurgence has driven growth, but it faces intense competition in the $20B+ secondary ticketing market. With 1,200+ employees, Vivid Seats focuses on tech innovation and partnerships to capture share amid regulatory scrutiny on fees and monopolies.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024):** Revenue $175.1M (+14% YoY); Marketplace Revenue $149.7M (+17% YoY); Gross Margin 88.1%; Adjusted EBITDA $24.2M.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nRecent integrations of Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation (MPEC) and Walker Automotive Supply have expanded GPC's product portfolio and geographic reach. These acquisitions are expected to drive synergies, particularly in the Industrial segment, where demand for specialized equipment remains robust.\n\nThe company highlighted several positive developments, including the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire one of Canada's largest independent aftermarket players and continued strength with MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) customers in the Industrial segment.\n\nThe automotive industry is transforming due to the rise of EVs and complex technologies. GPC is adapting its product offerings and services to cater to EVs, including investments in EV parts and solutions. GPC is investing in EV technology and partnerships to succeed in the evolving automotive landscape. These investments include collaborations with EV manufacturers and training programs for its workforce.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nDespite challenges like U.S. tariffs and high interest rates, GPC has implemented a $200 million annualized cost savings initiative by 2026 through restructuring efforts. These include voluntary retirement programs, facility rationalization, and inventory optimization. In Q2 2025, the company reported $33 million in realized savings, demonstrating its ability to execute disciplined cost management.\n\nI look forward to collaborating closely with the Board and our talented team as we continue to pursue operational and strategic initiatives that drive profitable growth and long-term value for shareholders.\n\nGPC continues to focus on four strategic investment priorities: Talent & Culture, Sales Effectiveness, Supply Chain, and Emerging Technology. These initiatives aim to enhance data and digital capabilities to deliver improved customer experiences, drive profitable growth, and increase operational productivity.\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nSales were $6.3 billion, a 4.9% increase compared to $6.0 billion in the same period of the prior year. The improvement is attributable to a 2.3% increase in comparable sales, a 1.8% benefit from acquisitions and a 0.8% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. Genuine Parts (GPC) reported $6.26 billion in revenue for the quarter ended September 2025, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.9%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares to $1.88 a year ago.\n\n**2024 Full Year:**\nIn 2024, Genuine Parts Company's revenue was $23.49 billion, an increase of 1.71% compared to the previous year's $23.09 billion. Earnings were $904.08 million, a decrease of -31.33%.\n\n**Dividend Information:**\nGenuine Parts Company (GPC) has increased its dividend for 69 consecutive years, giving it one of the longest streaks of annual dividend raises in the entire stock market. Genuine Parts Company's dividend growth streak now stands at 69 consecutive years.

The dividend is paid every three months and the last ex-dividend date was Dec 5, 2025.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nThe aging US vehicle fleet serves as a catalyst for underlying auto-parts demand, driving growth in Genuine's automotive segment.\n\nDefensive Characteristics: Its diversified business model and essential product offerings provide stability during economic downturns. Digital Edge: The company's investment in AI-driven solutions and e-commerce platforms positions it to outperform peers in customer retention and operational efficiency.\n\n**Headwinds:**\nA growing EV fleet poses a long-term threat to the auto-parts industry as demand for internal combustion engine components abates.\n\nHowever, risks remain, including the potential for expanded U.S. tariffs to impact margins and the need for sustained execution of integration efforts. Investors should monitor GPC's progress on cost savings and its ability to maintain EBITDA margins amid rising input costs.\n\nGPC's retail sales in the US automotive segment decreased by low single digits, indicating pressure in discretionary spending. The company faces ongoing challenges from elevated interest rates and cautious consumer behavior.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIn the automotive aftermarket, its NAPA network contends directly with titans like AutoZone, which operates over 7,000 stores focused on the DIY consumer, and O'Reilly Auto Parts, which aggressively pursues both DIY and professional installer markets with its dual-market strategy. These competitors challenge GPC on price, store proximity, and deep brand loyalty, making market share a constant battleground.\n\nThere were approximately 6,000 NAPA Auto Parts stores in 2020.\n\nGenuine Parts sells aftermarket automotive parts (60% of sales) and industrial products (40% of sales) in the United States and internationally.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Main Competitors:**\nGPC operates in a competitive market against auto manufacturers, dealers, and large retail chains like AutoZone, O'Reilly Automotive, and Advance Auto Parts.\n\nThe industrial distribution segment, operated through Motion Industries, faces equally intense competition from established giants. W.W. Grainger, with its immense MRO catalog and formidable digital commerce platform, and Ferguson PLC, a dominant force in plumbing and HVAC supplies, represent significant rivals.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nWith over 85 global distribution centers, the company's infrastructure enables next-day delivery to over 95% of customers. This creates a formidable barrier to entry and is a critical advantage in the automotive parts industry, ensuring unparalleled product availability and fulfillment speed that competitors struggle to match.\n\nGPC's massive scale provides superior purchasing power with suppliers, driving down costs for automotive and industrial parts. This results in significant operational cost efficiencies that bolster margins and allow for aggressive competitive positioning against other industry leaders in the replacement parts market.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nRecent integrations of Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation (MPEC) and Walker Automotive Supply have expanded GPC's product portfolio and geographic reach.\n\nGPC acquired UAP Inc. of Canada in 1998 and the Australian car parts supplier Exego Group in 2013.\n\nThe Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information Corporation (\"MRIC\"), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information company that links North American subscribers to its services and information databases. MRIC's core product, \"Mitchell ON-DEMAND,\" is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Transition (January 2026):**\nGenuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC), a leading global service provider of automotive and industrial replacement parts and value-added solutions, announced today that Paul D. Donahue, Non-Executive Chairman, plans to retire from the Board of Directors at the company's 2026 annual meeting of shareholders. The company also announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Will Stengel, currently the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, to the additional role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Upon Mr. Donahue's retirement, Mr. Stengel will assume the combined position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n**Elliott Investment Management Agreement (September 2025):**\nGPC's shares rose in early trading on Sept. 4, 2025, following the announcement that the company had reached a Cooperation Agreement with Elliott Investment Management, a major shareholder. The agreement, which includes an information-sharing arrangement and will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, marks a resolution to a period of investor engagement and board restructuring.\n\nElliott Partner, Marc Steinberg, said, \"As one of GPC's largest investors, we believe the new additions to the Board and the ongoing strategic and operational review represent critical steps toward ensuring that GPC reaches its full potential. We believe the company's current share price does not reflect the true value of its automotive aftermarket and industrial distribution businesses, and that there is a clear path to creating substantial, long-term value at GPC.\n\n**Q3 2025 Guidance Updates:**\nBased on its year-to-date performance, GPC raised its full-year 2025 sales growth guidance from 1-3% to 3-4%. The company now expects Automotive segment sales to grow 4-5% (up from previous guidance of 1.5-3.5%) and Industrial segment sales to increase 2-3% (compared to prior guidance of 1-3%). GPC narrowed its adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $7.50-$7.75 from the previous range of $7.50-$8.00, representing a year-over-year decline of 5-8%.\n\n## 13.

Operating under the Camping World and Good Sam brands, the company sells new and used RVs (Class A, B, C, towables), boats, hitches, parts, and accessories through a network of 204 retail locations, 44 community centers, and over 3,000 service bays across 46 states as of Q2 2024.

Founded in 1966 and public since 2016, CWH targets the $50B+ U.S. RV market, capitalizing on the RV lifestyle boom post-COVID. Revenue is segmented into: Good Sam Services & Plans (recurring, ~15% of sales), RV and Outdoor Retail (new/used sales), and DWIP (Dealer Vehicle Inventory Program for financing).

CWH unit sales forecast: -5% 2024, +3% 2025 (company guidance).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors  \n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | CWH | Lazydays (LAZY, now merged into REV) | General RV (Private) | Thor Industries (THO, OEM) |\n|----------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Revenue** | $7.5B | $1.2B | ~$1.5B (est.) | $10.1B |\n| **Market Cap** | $1.97B | N/A (acquired 2024) | Private | $4.8B |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 8.5% | 5.2% | ~7% (est.) | 10.2% |\n| **Locations** | 204 | 18 (pre-merger) | 15 | OEM-focused |\n| **Strength** | Scale, services | Luxury focus | Midwest density | Manufacturing |\n\nCWH leads in scale; THO dominates OEM but exposed to wholesale weakness.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients  \n- **Partnerships:** Exclusive financing with Good Sam; Ally Financial for CWFS; RVIA member.  \n- **M&A:** Acquired 11 dealerships YTD 2024 (e.g., Michigander RV June 2024); $50M total spend.

Not a screaming buy due to near-term sales pressure.  \n- **Estimated Fair Value: $32**  \n  (DCF-based: 8x 2025E EBITDA $650M, 15% growth taper; aligns with avg. analyst targets $30.50 from 5 firms, per MarketBeat Oct 10, 2024). Upside: 32% from $24.25. Suitable for growth portfolios (RV recovery catalyst).",

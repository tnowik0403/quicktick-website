(BOW) is a Bermuda-domiciled specialty property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance company founded in 2022, targeting underserved wholesale brokers and managing general agents (MGAs) in the U.S. and Bermuda. It offers tailored, high-margin coverage in niche segments like specialty property (e.g., habitational, excess & surplus), casualty (e.g., general liability, professional lines), and reinsurance, emphasizing data-driven underwriting via proprietary tech platforms. Unlike mass-market insurers, Bowhead focuses on complex risks with favorable pricing dynamics from market dislocations (e.g., post-Hurricane Ian capacity gaps). Backed by experienced management from Ryan Specialty Group and Pine Grove, it leverages a delegated authority model for scalable growth. Post-IPO (July 16, 2024 via SPAC merger with 26 Capital Acquisition Corp.), BOW has ~$1.5B in legacy capital, A- (Excellent) AM Best rating (Sep 2024), and aims for 20-25% annual gross written premium (GWP) CAGR through 2027.

(ROAD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $61.82\n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.22 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $43.34 - $69.48\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 55.2\n- **Forward P/E**: 28.5\n\n## Company Overview\nConstruction Partners, Inc. (ROAD) is a leading civil infrastructure construction company focused on the southeastern United States, operating across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Dothan, Alabama, the company delivers a full suite of infrastructure services, including asphalt paving, concrete pavement, bridge replacement and rehabilitation, aggregate mining and processing, soil stabilization, earthwork, drainage, traffic control, and site development. ROAD serves state departments of transportation (DOTs), county and municipal governments, and private clients, with a strong emphasis on highway and bridge projects funded by federal and state programs.\n\nThe company's competitive edge lies in its vertically integrated model, owning asphalt plants, quarries, and liquid asphalt terminals, which ensures supply chain control and cost efficiencies. As of June 30, 2024, ROAD reported a record backlog of $2.31 billion, reflecting robust demand from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA/IIJA funding streams). With approximately 2,100 employees and a fleet of specialized equipment, ROAD has grown from a regional player to a multi-state operator through organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. In FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024, preliminary), revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time, driven by public sector contracts amid aging U.S. infrastructure needs.

Deal funded by cash and debt; expected accretive in FY2025.\n- **Dividend Initiation (September 2024)**: Quarterly dividend of $0.08/share approved, payable October 31, 2024, signaling cash flow confidence.\n- **Stock Performance**: Up ~40% YTD as of October 11, 2024, outperforming S&P 500 (+22%) amid infrastructure sector rotation.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Organic Growth**: Leverage $2.31B backlog and IIJA funding ($1.2T over 5 years); target 10-15% annual revenue growth via bidding on state DOT projects.\n- **Acquisitions**: \"Tuck-in\" strategy in Sun Belt states; post-B.R. Howard, pipeline includes potential targets in Tennessee/Florida for $100-300M.\n- **Vertical Integration**: Expand aggregate reserves (current 1B+ tons) and asphalt capacity to 10M+ tons/year.\n- **Diversification**: Enter structural concrete/bridges (now 15% of backlog post-acquisition) from traditional paving (70%).\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Record backlog; vertical integration reduces input costs (asphalt self-produced ~70%); strong liquidity ($250M+ cash post-Q2). | Integration risks from recent M&A; elevated debt/EBITDA ~2.5x post-B.R. Howard. |\n| **Sector-Wide (Infrastructure Construction)** | IIJA disbursements accelerating ($110B highways/bridges); aging U.S. roads (D+ rating per ASCE); labor demand from $1T+ pipeline. | Material inflation (asphalt +10% YoY); skilled labor shortages (unfilled roles ~20% industry-wide); election-year funding uncertainty (post-Nov 2024). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- Asphalt paving (primary: 60-70% revenue): Highways, runways.\n- Concrete pavement/bridge rehab: 15-20%.\n- Aggregate production: 15M tons/year capacity.\n- Earthwork, drainage, utilities: Supporting services.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Structural Concrete Expansion**: Post-B.R. Howard, targeting $300M+ in bridge awards (e.g., Florida DOT's $1B bridge program).\n- **Aggregate Quarry Development**: New greenfield quarry in Georgia (permitting Q4 2024, operational 2025).\n- **Public-Private Partnerships (P3s)**: Piloting first P3 highway project in Alabama (bid submitted September 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- **U.S. Highway Paving (Southeast)**: ~4-6% (leader in AL/FL behind Vulcan Materials).\n- **State DOT Contracts (6-state footprint)**: ~8% of let projects by value.\n- **Asphalt Production (Region)**: ~10% via owned plants.\n\n**Forecast**: +1-2% annual market share growth through 2027 via M&A and IIJA bid wins; potential 10% Southeast expansion if funding sustained.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | ROAD | Sterling Infra (STRL) | Granite Const (GVA) | MasTec (MTZ) |\n|----------------------------|------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Revenue** | $1.84B | $2.6B | $3.5B | $11.0B |\n| **Backlog** | $2.31B | $4.1B | $5.2B | $11.5B |\n| **Gross Margin** | 16.5% | 19.2% | 12.8% | 11.5% |\n| **YTD Return** | +40% | +85% | +25% | -10% |\n| **Key Diff** | Regional focus, integration | National, higher margins | Diversified, scale | Telecom tilt |\n\nROAD trades at premium to peers on EV/EBITDA (18x fwd vs. sector 12x) but justified by growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Joint ventures with state DOTs (e.g., ALDOT design-build teams); supplier ties to Vulcan for excess asphalt.\n- **M&A History**: 5 tuck-ins since 2021 ($500M+ total); latest B.R. Howard (July 2024).\n- **Current Major Clients**: ALDOT (25% revenue), FDOT (20%), GDOT (15%); counties/municipals (30%).\n- **Potential Clients**: NCDOT/SCDOT expansion post-acquisition; federal FAST-14 grants ($100M+ pipeline).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong safety record (TRIR 1.2 vs. industry 2.0); DB-certified in 3 states for diverse bidding.\n- **Management**: CEO Charles Black (since 2001) track record of 25% CAGR; insider ownership 10%.\n- **Risks**: Weather-sensitive (hurricanes in SE); bid margins compressing to 8-10%.\n- **Catalysts**: Full FY2025 guidance (Oct 2024 earnings); IIJA reauthorization talks.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** – Buy for growth upside; Hold if risk-averse). Rationale: Backlog visibility supports 15-20% EPS growth FY2025-26; IIJA tailwinds outweigh macro risks; undervalued vs. peers on backlog/revenue multiple.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $75 (22% upside from $61.82). DCF-based (10% WACC, 15% revenue CAGR 3yrs, 5% terminal); implies 20x FY2026 EV/EBITDA. Suited for growth portfolio with moderate risk (beta 1.1).",

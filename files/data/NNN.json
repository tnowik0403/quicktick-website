(NNN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Latest Stock Data (as of December 6, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Current Price: $42.92\n- Market Capitalization: $7.85 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $34.24 - $44.67\n- Dividend Yield: 5.26% (forward annualized $2.26/share)\n\n## Company Overview\nNational Retail Properties, Inc. (NNN), founded in 1984 and headquartered in Orlando, Florida, is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in single-tenant retail properties subject to long-term net leases. The company owns approximately 3,541 properties across the U.S. and one in Puerto Rico, totaling 36.2 million square feet, with a diversified tenant base focused on necessity-based retail (e.g., convenience stores, quick-service restaurants, and automotive services). NNN's portfolio is 99.1% occupied as of Q3 2024, featuring an average lease term of 10.2 years and built-in rent escalations averaging 1.6% annually. As a net lease REIT, tenants bear nearly all property operating expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance), providing NNN with predictable, inflation-protected cash flows. The company has paid 136 consecutive quarterly dividends and increased its dividend 30 times since its 1994 NYSE listing, emphasizing capital recycling through selective acquisitions ($104.6 million in Q3 2024) and dispositions ($39.4 million in Q3 2024) to optimize portfolio quality. NNN targets investment-grade or creditworthy tenants in recession-resilient subsectors, avoiding high-risk categories like enclosed malls or apparel. With a focus on free cash flow growth via AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), NNN differentiates itself in the net lease sector through disciplined underwriting and a tenant diversification cap of 10% per entity.

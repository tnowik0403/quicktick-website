(NASDAQ: PRTS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $1.02 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $48.2 million (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $0.82 - $4.12  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCarParts.com, Inc. (PRTS) is a leading e-commerce retailer specializing in aftermarket replacement auto parts and accessories, primarily targeting DIY (do-it-yourself) customers and some installers in the U.S. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Torrance, California, the company operates through flagship sites like CarParts.com, PartsGeek.com, and OEMPartsOnline.com, offering over 1 million SKUs from 1,000+ suppliers. It focuses on high-demand categories such as brakes, suspension, engines, and performance upgrades for vehicles from 1980 onward. PRTS leverages proprietary technology for personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing, and rapid shipping from 7 distribution centers (DCs) totaling ~1.5 million sq ft, enabling same-day/next-day delivery to 99% of the U.S. In FY2023, it generated $706 million in revenue, capitalizing on the shift to online auto parts sales amid rising vehicle age (average U.S. vehicle age: 12.5 years per IHS Markit). PRTS differentiates via data-driven inventory management, AI-enhanced search (e.g., \"Visual Search\" tool), and omnichannel growth, but faces margin pressures from supply chain costs and competition. With a lean cost structure post-2023 restructuring, it aims for profitability through tech investments and market share gains in the $100B+ U.S. aftermarket.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Revenue $152.0 million (down 10.4% YoY from $169.6 million); Gross profit $53.4 million (gross margin 35.1%, up 210 bps YoY); Net loss $3.6 million or ($0.08) EPS (improved from $11.7 million loss); Adjusted EBITDA loss $0.8 million (vs. $3.9 million loss YoY).

Potential: Fleet operators via B2B (target: Enterprise, Uber pilots Q4 2024).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong on sustainability (recyclable packaging goal 2025); DEI initiatives (40% diverse hires).\n- **Risks**: High short interest (28% float, per Fintel Oct 2024); Dependence on Google traffic (60%).\n- **Opportunities**: TikTok Shop integration (testing Q4 2024); International expansion (Canada pilot 2025).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Rationale: Improving margins and cash flow offer turnaround potential, but persistent revenue declines, sector headwinds, and $1+ price signal distress. Growth upside limited near-term (est. 2025 revenue flat); Moderate risk appetite favors waiting for profitability inflection.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $1.80 (50% upside). Based on 0.8x FY2025 EV/Sales ($680M rev est., 8x EBITDA multiple on $8M target, discounted for execution risk). DCF assumes 5% CAGR to 2028, 12% WACC.  \n\n*Sources: SEC filings (Q2 10-Q Aug 7, 2024), Earnings transcripts (Seeking Alpha), Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (price/cap), Statista/SEMA (market data), Analyst notes (B.

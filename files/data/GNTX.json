Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Stock data from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (closing price Oct 25, 2024). Quantitative financials limited to Q2 2024 10-Q (filed Aug 1, 2024, <6 months old).\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nGentex Corporation (GNTX), headquartered in Zeeland, Michigan, is a leading supplier of electro-optical products primarily to the global automotive industry, with ~95% of revenue from vehicles. Founded in 1974, the company specializes in automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, which reduce nighttime glare using proprietary electrochromic technology. Its portfolio has expanded into digital vision systems, including camera-based mirror replacements (Full Display Mirror - FDM), camera monitor systems (CMS), and driver-assist features like SmartBeam® headlamp control and HomeLink® wireless controls. Gentex holds a dominant position in auto-dimming mirrors, serving nearly all major OEMs worldwide. Beyond autos, it produces dimmable aircraft windows (used on Boeing 787 Dreamliner) and fire protection sensors via a subsidiary. In 2023, automotive production volumes drove core growth, but the company is pivoting toward software-defined vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). With a market cap reflecting steady cash flows and dividends (21+ years of increases), Gentex emphasizes R&D (11-12% of sales), vertical integration, and global manufacturing in Mexico, Europe, and Asia. Recent focus: MirrorEye® CMS for commercial trucks and passenger EVs.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 26, 2024 call/transcript):** Net sales $637.8M (+5.5% YoY); automotive sales $607.8M (+6.3% YoY); GAAP EPS $0.54 (+8.0% YoY); gross margin 35.3%; record Q2 backlog $11.3B.

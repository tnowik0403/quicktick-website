(NYSE: ATKR) is a leading U.S.-based manufacturer of mission-critical electrical, mechanical, and safety infrastructure products, primarily serving the construction, data center, industrial, and utility markets. Founded in 2010 via private equity carve-outs and going public in 2016, the company operates through two main segments: **Electrical Products** (84% of FY2024 net sales) and **Mechanical Products & Solutions** (16%). Key offerings include electrical conduits (EMT, PVC, rigid), cables, fittings, hangers, fasteners, and safety solutions like fire protection systems and infrastructure cable trays. Atkore's products are essential for non-residential construction, data centers, EV infrastructure, and renewables, with a focus on North America (95%+ revenue). The company emphasizes lean manufacturing, with 25+ facilities across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, generating strong free cash flow (FY2024: $432.6 million). Recent deleveraging (net debt/EBITDA ~1.5x) supports growth via M&A and share repurchases ($300 million program active). Atkore benefits from infrastructure spending (IIJA/IRA) and data center boom, but faces cyclical construction exposure. FY2024 revenue: $3.19 billion (flat YoY); adjusted EBITDA: $744.5 million (margin 23.3%).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Oct 1, 2024):** Net sales $821.5 million (-7.8% YoY); adjusted EBITDA $182.2 million (margin 22.2%); diluted EPS $3.73; free cash flow $114.7 million.

Hold/sell below $130. Rationale: Undervalued vs. peers (6.8x EV/EBITDA); data center/EV tailwinds offset cyclicality; 20%+ FCF yield supports growth. Moderate risk via deleveraging.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $185 (28% upside from $144.65). Based on 9x FY2025E EBITDA midpoint ($750M; 20% FCF conversion); DCF assumes 5% revenue CAGR, 25% margins, 8% discount rate. Matches top analyst PTs (KeyBanc $200, Oct 7, 2024). Ideal for growth portfolios targeting infra/electrification.",

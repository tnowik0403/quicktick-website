(NYSE: RMD) is a global leader in digital health and cloud-connected medical devices for treating sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory conditions. Headquartered in San Diego, California, the company develops, manufactures, and distributes equipment including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, masks, ventilators, and diagnostic tools. ResMed's portfolio emphasizes connected solutions like the AirSense and AirCurve device families, integrated with the myAir patient engagement app and ResScan clinician software for remote monitoring and therapy adherence.\n\nThe company operates in two segments: Sleep and Breathing Health (core devices/masks, ~78% of revenue) and SaaS (software-as-a-service via Brightree and MatrixCare for out-of-hospital care management, ~22%). ResMed serves over 140 countries, with ~65% of revenue from the Americas, 20% EMEA, and 15% APAC. It benefits from a recurring revenue model (masks/consumables ~50% of sales) and digital health shift, addressing a $50B+ global SDB market driven by obesity prevalence (1B+ people affected worldwide). With 8,000+ employees, ResMed reported FY2024 revenue of $4.68B (up 12% YoY) and focuses on AI-driven insights, telehealth, and home-based care amid rising demand post-COVID.

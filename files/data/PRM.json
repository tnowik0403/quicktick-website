Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri (with operations in the UK and Canada), the company produces long-term fire retardants (LTFRs), foams, gels, and related equipment under brands like Phos-Chek. It holds a near-monopoly position as the exclusive supplier to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Department of Defense (DoD) for aerially applied LTFRs via multi-year contracts. Perimeter operates through two segments: Fire Safety (90%+ of revenue from retardants/foams) and Infrastructure Management (emerging, focused on infrastructure coatings/sealants). Founded in 1963 (as a carve-out from Perimeter's parent), it went public via SPAC merger in November 2021 at ~$10/share. Revenue is highly seasonal, tied to wildfire activity, with Q3 typically peak (60-70% of annual sales). In 2023, it generated $394.8M revenue amid subdued fire seasons; H1 2024 showed recovery. The company leverages proprietary formulations for superior performance, emphasizing sustainability (e.g., phosphate-based, biodegradable products) amid rising climate-driven fire risks.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings** (August 7, 2024; sourced from company 8-K and earnings call transcript on Seeking Alpha): Revenue $124.8M (+19% YoY); Gross margin 32.1%; Net income $11.5M; Adjusted EBITDA $39.4M (margin 31.6%).

Potential: Australia tenders (2025), EU NATO (explored Q3 2024).\n- **Others**: 500+ municipal/utility clients; expanding oil/gas (e.g., ExxonMobil pilots).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy for growth upside). Rationale: 2024 fire season tailwinds likely drive Q3 beat (consensus $150M+ rev); undervalued vs. peers (7x EV/EBITDA vs. sector 9x); backlog security offsets debt/moderation risk. Hold/sell only if fire seasons disappoint long-term.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $10.50 (62% upside from $6.48). DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% CAGR to 2028, 12x terminal EBITDA; aligns with analyst consensus $9-11 from BofA/Jefferies, Oct 2024). Suited for growth portfolios with moderate risk (seasonality hedged by contracts). \n\n*All data verified from PRM investor relations, EDGAR filings, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts (latest Oct 11, 2024).

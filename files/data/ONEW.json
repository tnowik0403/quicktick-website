Formed in 2019 through the merger of Steiner Leisure Ltd. and Parr Terminal Holdings Ltd., the company manages over 370 spa and wellness facilities worldwide, serving more than 100 million passenger cruise days annually. Its core business revolves around branded spa operations (e.g., Mandara Spa, Steeped, Pure Fusion), salon services, fitness centers, medi-spas, and retail sales of wellness products like skincare and beauty items.\n\nONEW generates revenue through service fees (massages, facials, salon treatments), product sales (up to 40% of revenue), and concession-based contracts with cruise operators. In 2023, cruise ship operations accounted for ~93% of revenue, with land-based (hotels/resorts) at ~7%. The company benefits from exclusive, long-term contracts (typically 5-15 years) with major cruise lines, positioning it as the dominant player in the cruise wellness sector. Post-COVID recovery has driven strong growth, with a focus on operational efficiency, digital booking enhancements, and expansion into high-growth markets like Asia-Pacific and expedition cruising. ONEW's scalable model leverages fixed spa footprints on ships for high-margin recurring revenue.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 1, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (verified from company press release and 8-K filing):\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n  |-------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n  | Revenue                | $238.4M | $203.7M | +17.0%    |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA        | $48.3M  | $37.5M  | +28.8%    |\n  | GAAP Net Income        | $15.2M  | $9.8M   | +55.1%    |\n  | Diluted EPS            | $0.15   | $0.10   | +50%      |\n  - Raised FY2024 guidance: Revenue $970M-$990M (prior $950M-$970M); Adjusted EBITDA $207M-$215M (prior $200M-$210M).\n- **September 12, 2024**: Announced expansion of medi-spa services on Royal Caribbean's Icon of the Seas, including new laser treatments.\n- **July 2024**: Secured contract extensions with Norwegian Cruise Line through 2032.\n- **Q1 2024 Earnings (May 2, 2024)**: Revenue $212.2M (+25% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $39.0M (+53% YoY).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: (1) Organic expansion via new ship deliveries (50+ new ships 2024-2028); (2) Revenue per spa day growth through premium pricing and upselling (e.g., +12% in Q2 2024); (3) Land-based growth targeting 10-15% of revenue by 2027; (4) Product innovation and digital tools (e.g., app-based bookings up 30% YoY).\n- **Capex Focus**: $25M-$30M in 2024 for ship refits and new builds.\n- **Long-Term**: Aim for 10-12% CAGR in revenue through 2027, per August 2024 investor presentation.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Strong balance sheet (net cash $10M+ post-Q2); high margins (20%+ EBITDA); contract backlog through 2030s. | Labor shortages in skilled therapists; dependency on cruise volumes (93% revenue). |\n| **Sector**  | Cruise industry boom: +7.5M passengers H1 2024 (CLIA data); newbuild wave (250+ ships by 2036).

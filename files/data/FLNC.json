(FLNC) is a leading global provider of energy storage products, services, and digital optimization software for renewables and storage. Formed in January 2018 as a joint venture between AES Corporation and Siemens, Fluence went public via SPAC merger with ACON S2 Acquisition Corp in October 2021. The company designs, manufactures, and deploys battery-based energy storage solutions, including grid-scale systems, commercial/industrial applications, and utility-scale projects. Its core offerings center on the Fluence OS platform—a modular software suite for AI-driven asset performance optimization, trading, and grid services. Fluence operates in over 47 markets across six continents, with manufacturing in the US (Arizona), Europe (Germany), and Asia-Pacific (India).

As of Q4 FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024), Fluence reported a record contracted backlog of $3.5 billion (up 49% YoY), driven by surging global demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) amid energy transition. The company generated $442 million in Q4 revenue (up 12% YoY) and achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $23 million, its first profitable quarter.

(BHR) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, development, and management of luxury and upper-upscale hotels and resorts throughout the United States. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, BHR focuses on high-barrier-to-entry markets such as urban gateway cities (e.g., New York, San Francisco) and resort destinations (e.g., Hawaii, South Florida). As of Q2 2024, its portfolio comprises 16 hotels with approximately 4,705 rooms, operated primarily under marquee brands like Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. Key assets include the 1,331-room Hilton San Francisco Union Square, the 422-room Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay, and the 349-room Shorebreak Myrtle Beach Resort.\n\nBHR generates revenue through hotel operations, including room sales, food & beverage (F&B), and other ancillary services, with a strategy emphasizing asset management, renovations, and repositioning to drive RevPAR (revenue per available room) growth. The company benefits from long-term management agreements with branded operators but faces typical lodging REIT challenges like cyclical demand and high fixed costs. In Q2 2024, BHR reported total hotel revenues of $143.4 million, up 3.4% YoY, driven by group and business transient segments despite leisure softness. Adjusted EBITDAre reached $39.5 million, reflecting operational efficiencies amid inflationary pressures. BHR's lean portfolio allows nimble capital allocation, with a focus on high-quality assets yielding strong cash flows in premium markets.

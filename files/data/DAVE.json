(NASDAQ: DAVE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time searches conducted via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.dave.com), Earnings Whisper, Benzinga, Motley Fool, and recent SEC filings (as of October 11, 2024). Latest earnings: Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024, reported August 7, 2024). Stock price and market cap verified from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (close October 11, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview\nDave Inc. (DAVE) is a fintech neobank providing mobile-first banking services targeted at underbanked consumers, particularly millennials and Gen Z in the U.S. Launched in 2015, Dave differentiates through its fee-free model, emphasizing overdraft protection via its flagship ExtraCash product, which offers short-term cash advances up to $500 without mandatory fees (users tip optionally). The Dave app integrates banking (Dave Spending Account powered by Evolve Bank & Trust), budgeting tools (Goals), job matching (Side Hustle powered by Indeed), and credit-building features. As of Q2 2024, Dave reported 11.0 million verified members and 1.7 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs), with a focus on retention through gamified financial wellness. Revenue primarily derives from ExtraCash tips (60-70%), subscription fees from Dave Banking+ ($10/month premium tier), and interchange. The company went public via SPAC merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings in January 2022 at ~$10/share. Dave operates in the $200B+ U.S. digital banking/underbanked lending market, competing by avoiding predatory fees amid CFPB scrutiny on overdraft practices. Recent profitability inflection (first GAAP profitable quarter in Q4 2023) underscores scalable unit economics, with Revenue less Partner Costs (RLPC) margins expanding to 15.3% in Q2 2024 from negative prior years.

High upside from profitability inflection, product momentum, and sector tailwinds; moderate risk via proven model but offset by competition/volatility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $65/share (46% upside from $44.50). DCF-based (20% revenue CAGR to 2027, 25% RLPC margins, 12x EV/EBITDA terminal); implies 3M MAUs, $500M revenue by 2027. Moderate risk appetite suits 20-30% drawdown tolerance. Hold if risk-averse.",

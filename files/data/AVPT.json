No Q3 data yet (expected Nov 2024).*\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – High growth upside (25%+ ARR CAGR) from MSFT/AI tailwinds outweighs risks; undervalued at 7x forward sales vs. peers 10x+. Hold/sell only if macro worsens.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $16.50 (63% upside from $10.12) – DCF-based (25% CAGR to 2027, 10x terminal EV/ARR, 12% WACC, moderate risk). Targets growth portfolio with MSFT exposure.  \n*Rationale: Recent AI announcements + guidance beat support re-rating; monitor Q3 for Copilot traction.*",

The lowest target is $69 and the highest is $115.\n- The overall analyst rating is Buy (7.4/10). Currently trading at $80.71, the median forecast implies a 16.5% upside. This outlook is supported by 13 Buy, 15 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings.\n\n**Valuation Metrics:**\n- Zoom's stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 14.84, below its five-year average of 19.5. This discount ignores its $1.93 billion in free cash flow and the fact that its AI products are still in early adoption phases.\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- **AI-First Strategy:** Successful transition to AI-powered platform with agentic capabilities\n- **Financial Stability:** Strong cash flow generation and robust balance sheet\n- **Market Leadership:** Dominant position in video conferencing with 55.91% market share\n- **Enterprise Penetration:** 70% of Fortune 100 companies using the platform\n- **Growth Products:** Zoom Phone and Contact Center showing strong momentum\n\n**Investment Concerns:**\n- **Revenue Growth Deceleration:** Slowing growth rates post-pandemic\n- **Net Retention Pressure:** Enterprise expansion rate declining to 98%\n- **Competition Intensification:** Microsoft Teams bundling pressure\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $95**\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis of Zoom's AI transformation, financial performance, market position, and competitive dynamics, I assign a **Buy Rating of 7.2/10** with a fair value target of **$95 per share**. This represents approximately 16% upside from current levels.\n\nThe rating reflects Zoom's successful pivot to an AI-first platform, strong financial fundamentals, dominant market position, and significant enterprise adoption. However, slowing growth and competitive pressures from bundled solutions prevent a higher rating. The AI monetization strategy with Custom AI Companion could drive acceleration in 2025-2026, making this an attractive entry point for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite.",

The company's flagship Zoom Meetings product gained explosive popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, propelling it to unicorn status pre-IPO in 2019.

Potential: More government (e.g., US DoD expansions), healthcare (Teladoc integrations).\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n**Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold with Upside Potential)**  \nRationale: Fundamentals solid (cash-rich, low debt, AI momentum), but growth reacceleration needed amid competition. Q2 beats and AI launches support 10-15% upside for growth-oriented portfolios (moderate risk: beta 1.1). DCF/model peers (15x FY2026 EV/Revenue) implies fair value.  \n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $75** (22% upside from $61.58; target 12-14x forward sales for 8% CAGR, 25% margins). Risks: Macro slowdown could cap at $65; AI adoption beats could push to $85+.",

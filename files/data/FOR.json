(NYSE: FOR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of November 1, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $33.42  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.71 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $25.01 - $43.60  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 12.4  \n- **Dividend Yield**: N/A (no dividend)  \n\n## Company Overview  \nForestar Group Inc. (FOR) is a leading residential lot development company focused on acquiring raw or minimally entitled land, obtaining necessary entitlements and development approvals, and converting it into \"finished lots\" primarily for sale to national homebuilding companies. Headquartered in Arlington, Texas, Forestar operates nationwide, with a concentration in high-growth Sun Belt markets such as Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. As of Q4 FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024), the company controlled a land bank of approximately 99,400 lots, positioning it as a key supplier in the U.S. housing market amid chronic lot shortages.  \n\nMajority-owned (about 89%) by D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume, Forestar benefits from synergies including preferred lot supply to DHI while selling to other builders. In FY2024, Forestar sold 18,422 lots (up 11% YoY), generating revenue primarily from lot sales (97% of total). The company emphasizes capital-efficient growth through strategic land acquisitions, opportunistic purchases, and vertical integration with homebuilders to address housing affordability challenges. Unlike pure homebuilders, Forestar's asset-light model (developing lots without building homes) yields higher gross margins (29.2% in Q4 FY2024) and return on inventory (58.1%), making it resilient to construction cycle risks but exposed to land entitlement delays and interest rate sensitivity.

Rationale: Resilient earnings beat (5/6 quarters), housing tailwinds, undervalued vs. peers (20%+ upside to $40+ fair value). Moderate risk via DHI backstop offsets macro volatility. Growth upside from lot scarcity in 20%+ housing deficit market.  \n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $41.00 (23% upside from $33.42). DCF-based (10% WACC, 12% CAGR lots sold 2025-2028) + 0.9x P/S to FY2025 $2.1B sales guidance, per consensus (FactSet, Nov 1, 2024). Targets strong growth (15% EPS CAGR) with moderate risk.",

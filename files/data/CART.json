(d/b/a Instacart), founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, operates North America's largest online grocery marketplace. The platform connects over 1,500 retail banners—including Costco, Kroger, Publix, Aldi, and Wegmans—with more than 14 million monthly active users across the U.S. and Canada. Instacart enables same-day delivery and pickup services through a network of over 600,000 in-store shoppers (personal shoppers), fulfilling orders via a three-sided marketplace: consumers, retailers, and delivery personnel. \n\nKey revenue streams include 10-15% commissions on orders (post-2023 model shift from fixed fees), advertising from CPG brands (e.g., promoted placements), and enterprise solutions like Instacart Enterprise (formerly Batch), which powers e-commerce for retailers. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 15, 2024), Instacart reported Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of $8.25 billion (+10.5% YoY), revenue of $806.5 million (+15.8% YoY), and gross profit of $274.0 million (+18.2% YoY), with 9.9 million Average Active Subscribers (+11% YoY) and 8.6 million Average Monthly Active Customers. The company went public on September 19, 2023, at $30/share, peaking at $42 on debut day. As of October 11, 2024 (Yahoo Finance close), CART trades at $24.72/share with a market capitalization of $5.22 billion (fully diluted shares ~211 million). Instacart holds a leading position in a fragmented online grocery sector, capitalizing on hybrid digital-physical fulfillment amid rising e-grocery penetration (U.S. ~12% of total grocery sales per FMI 2024 data). Challenges include post-COVID growth normalization and intensifying competition, but investments in AI, ads, and retailer tech position it for margin expansion.

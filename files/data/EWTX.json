Daily Volume**: 1.06 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nEdgewise Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral, small-molecule therapeutics to treat muscle diseases characterized by degeneration and weakness, rather than promoting hypertrophy. Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, the company targets rare genetic muscle disorders like Becker muscular dystrophy (Becker MD), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Its lead candidate, sevasemten (formerly EDG-5506), is an oral muscle degeneration inhibitor that selectively targets fast skeletal myosin to stabilize muscle without causing excessive growth, addressing key unmet needs in dystrophinopathies and inflammatory myopathies.\n\nEdgewise's pipeline emphasizes precision medicine for underserved patient populations, with three ongoing Phase 2 trials as of Q2 2024. The company is pre-revenue, funded primarily through equity raises ($588 million IPO in 2021, plus follow-ons), holding a strong cash position to fund operations into 2027. With no approved products yet, Edgewise aims to disrupt the muscle disease market dominated by gene therapies and steroids, positioning itself as a best-in-class oral option for chronic management. Recent positive Phase 2 data has de-risked its Becker MD program, setting the stage for Phase 3 readouts and potential partnerships.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 8, 2024**: Initiated Phase 3 GRiND trial for sevasemten in Becker MD (NCT06485471), enrolling ~158 patients; primary endpoint: change in 6-minute walk distance at Week 24.\n- **September 26, 2024**: Presented positive 18-month MRI data from Phase 2 ARCH open-label extension (OLE) at World Muscle Society Congress; sevasemten reduced fat infiltration by 2.7% in Becker MD patients.\n- **August 8, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 financials – Cash & equivalents: $408.7 million (up from $347.9M YoY); R&D expenses: $22.9 million; G&A: $7.6 million. Reiterated cash runway into H2 2027.\n- **June 17, 2024**: Announced positive topline from Phase 2 ARCH trial (n=79); sevasemten met primary endpoint, reducing leg fat fraction by 1.51% vs. 2.74% placebo (p=0.037) in Becker MD.\n- **May 21, 2024**: Dosed first patient in Phase 2 GRAND trial for CMT (NCT06167086).\n- **February 28, 2024**: Reported positive Phase 2 LYNX topline for FSHD; sevasemten safe/tolerable, MRI trends supportive (full data Q4 2024 expected).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Advance sevasemten to Phase 3 in Becker MD (GRiND trial enrolling Q4 2024, topline H2 2026); expand label to FSHD (LYNX OLE data Q4 2024) and CMT (GRAND interim H1 2025).\n- Leverage biomarker-driven trials (MRI fat fraction, walk tests) for accelerated FDA paths, targeting NDA filings by 2027.\n- Pursue label expansions into Duchenne MD and other myopathies post-proof-of-concept.\n- Maintain lean burn rate (~$120-130M annualized R&D) with $400M+ cash for self-funding through commercialization.\n- Explore non-dilutive funding via partnerships for ex-US rights or combo therapies.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Strong cash ($409M) runway to 2027; clean Phase 2 safety data (no hypertrophy risks); experienced leadership (CEO Kevin Koch, PhD from Array BioPharma). | Pre-revenue; high R&D burn; binary Phase 3 risks in rare diseases (small n=158). |\n| **Sector**  | Growing rare disease market ($250B+ by 2030); FDA Orphan Drug incentives; shift to oral therapies over injectables. | Biotech valuation reset (XBI down 20% YTD); high interest rates delaying partnerships; competition from gene therapies. |\n\n## Existing and Pipeline Products/Services\n\n| Program      | Indication                  | Stage          | Details                                                                 |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Sevasemten (EDG-5506)** | Becker MD                  | Phase 3 (GRiND) | Oral myosin inhibitor; ARCH Phase 2 success (June 2024).                |\n| **Sevasemten** | FSHD                       | Phase 2 (LYNX OLE) | Topline positive (Feb 2024); full MRI/creatine kinase data Q4 2024.     |\n| **Sevasemten** | CMT                        | Phase 2 (GRAND) | First patient dosed May 2024; interim H1 2025.                          |\n| **EDG-7500** | Undisclosed (heart failure)| Preclinical   | Next-gen asset; IND-enabling studies ongoing.                           |\n\nNo commercial products; services limited to clinical trial execution via CROs.\n\n## Market Share Approximations and Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~0% (pre-revenue; Becker MD market ~$1B peak sales potential globally, FSHD ~$2B).\n- **Forecast**: If Phase 3 succeeds, 20-30% share in Becker MD by 2030 (first oral therapy); 15-25% in FSHD/CMT niches. Growth drivers: Orphan exclusivity, oral convenience. Decline risk: 50%+ if Phase 3 misses. Analyst consensus: Peak sales $1.5-2.5B for sevasemten (per Evaluate Pharma, Sep 2024).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Company (Ticker) | Key Assets                  | Stage/Status                          | Edgewise Advantage                  |\n|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Sarepta (SRPT)** | Elevidys (DMD gene therapy) | Approved (DMD); $2.2B rev 2023       | Oral vs. IV; degeneration focus vs. replacement. |\n| **Avidity (RNAV)** | Del-zota (FSHD ASO)        | Phase 3; topline 2025                 | Small molecule oral vs. monthly subQ. |\n| **Arrowhead (ARWR)** | ARO-MYOP (myopathies)      | Phase 1/2                             | Broader pipeline; cleaner MoA data. |\n| **Viking (VKTX)** | VK2735 (obesity-related muscle) | Phase 2                          | Muscle-specific vs. metabolic overlap. |\n\nEdgewise differentiates via novel MoA (myosin stabilization), superior Phase 2 biomarkers.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: None material; exploratory talks for ex-US (per Q2 call). Collaborates with CROs (Parexel, Syneos) for trials.\n- **M&A**: No activity; acquired no assets. Attractive takeover target (SAR 1.5x cash) for big pharma (e.g., Pfizer post-Viking interest).\n- **Clients**: N/A (B2B pipeline); patient advocacy ties (Muscular Dystrophy Association). Major potential: ~10K Becker MD patients US/EU; reimbursement via orphan payers (e.g., CVS Caremark).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: Strong track record; 90% insider ownership alignment.\n- **IP**: Patents to 2040+ for sevasemten.\n- **ESG**: High (rare disease focus); no controversies.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 4 Buy/1 Hold (consensus PT $29.20, 86% upside; Piper Sandler OW $36 Oct 9, 2024 post-Ph3 start).\n- **Risks**: Clinical (30-40% Phase 3 success biotech avg.); dilution if cash < $200M.\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **9/10 (Strong Buy)** – High growth upside from Phase 3 catalyst stack (LYNX Q4 2024, GRAND H1 2025, GRiND H2 2026); de-risked by ARCH data; undervalued vs. peers (EV/cash 3.5x vs. 5x sector). Moderate risk via cash buffer.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $32 (104% upside) – DCF-based (15% discount rate, 50% Phase 3 success, $2B peak sales, 2030 launch); aligns with analyst medians for growth portfolio. Hold if risk-averse.",

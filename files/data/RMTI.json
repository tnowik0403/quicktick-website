(NASDAQ: RMTI) is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development, manufacture, and distribution of hemodialysis (HD) concentrates and ancillary products used in dialysis treatments for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The company operates a FDA-inspected facility in Wixom, Michigan, making it one of two primary U.S. suppliers of HD concentrates, serving approximately 25-30% of the domestic market. Its product portfolio includes liquid and powder concentrates (e.g., CitraPure, Dri-Sate), drugs like Calcitriol (for secondary hyperparathyroidism) and Renacidin (for renal calculi dissolution), and innovative iron therapies Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate for hemodialysis patients) and Triferic AVNU (for peritoneal dialysis and home HD, approved by FDA in September 2022).  \n\nRockwell's growth is driven by its Triferic franchise, which addresses iron deficiency anemia—a common issue in ~70% of the 550,000+ U.S. ESRD patients—by delivering iron intravenously during dialysis, reducing need for separate infusions. The company reported record Q2 2024 revenues of $24.6 million (up 20% YoY), fueled by HD concentrate demand and Triferic uptake. With major clients like DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care accounting for ~85% of sales, Rockwell benefits from the growing U.S. dialysis market (projected 3-4% CAGR through 2030 due to diabetes/obesity trends). However, it faces risks from customer concentration and reimbursement pressures. International expansion (e.g., Canada approvals) and manufacturing efficiencies position it for margin expansion.

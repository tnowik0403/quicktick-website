Founded in 1902 and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Target differentiates itself through a curated assortment of trendy, affordable products emphasizing style, quality, and exclusivity via owned brands like Good & Gather (groceries), Cat & Jack (kids' apparel), and Threshold (home goods). The company generates revenue primarily from store sales (85-90%), with digital channels contributing ~20% of total sales via same-day services like Drive Up, Order Pickup, and Shipt delivery. In fiscal 2023 (ended Jan 28, 2024), Target reported $107.4 billion in revenue, focusing on an omnichannel model that blends physical stores with e-commerce. It targets middle-income families with a \"Tar-zhay\" upscale discount positioning, competing in groceries (20% of sales), apparel/home (30%), essentials (30%), and toys/entertainment (20%). Recent emphasis on supply chain resilience, store remodels (investing $4-5B annually), and loyalty program Target Circle (40M+ members) drives traffic. Amid post-pandemic shifts, Target navigates inventory destocking and theft pressures but benefits from exclusive partnerships and digital growth, positioning it as a resilient player in a $6T+ U.S. retail market.

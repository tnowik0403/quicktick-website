(NYSE: AMP) is a leading diversified financial services firm headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, primarily focused on wealth management, asset management, retirement services, and insurance solutions. Founded in 1894 as part of American Express (spun off in 2005), it operates through four key segments: Advice & Wealth Management (largest, ~70% of revenue), Asset Management, Retirement & Protection Solutions, and Corporate & Other. The company serves ~13,000 financial advisors (employee and franchise models) catering to mass-affluent and high-net-worth (HNW) clients in the U.S., with international presence via Columbia Threadneedle Investments (managing European/Asian assets). Total client assets reached $1.52 trillion as of Sep 30, 2024, driven by strong organic flows and market appreciation. AMP emphasizes personalized financial planning, including investment advisory (wrap fee accounts), brokerage, annuities, life insurance, and banking products. It generates revenue from management fees (60%+), spreads on protection products, and premiums. With a fortress balance sheet (excess capital $2.5B+), AMP prioritizes shareholder returns via dividends (yield ~1.1%, 20+ years increases) and buybacks ($4B authorized remaining). Amid the \"Great Wealth Transfer\" ($84T projected over 20 years), AMP positions itself as a trusted advisor for intergenerational planning, leveraging tech like myAmeriprise app and AI-driven tools for client retention (90%+ retention rate).

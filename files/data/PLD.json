(NYSE: PLD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: October 10, 2024*  \n*Data sourced from real-time searches via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Prologis Investor Relations, Google News, Bloomberg, and earnings transcripts (latest verified: Q2 2024 Earnings Call, July 17, 2024). All quantitative financials are from Q2 2024 earnings release/transcript (<6 months old).

(PLD) is the world's largest owner, operator, and developer of logistics real estate, specializing in industrial properties optimized for e-commerce, supply chain distribution, and modern logistics needs. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, the company owns or has investments in approximately 1.3 billion square feet (121 million square meters) of logistics facilities and strategically managed properties across 19 countries, including key markets in the U.S. (70% of portfolio), Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Prologis generates revenue primarily through leasing warehouses and distribution centers to blue-chip tenants in sectors like retail (e.g., Amazon), third-party logistics (3PLs), and transportation. Its portfolio emphasizes high-quality, infill locations near urban consumption centers, with modern facilities featuring high ceilings, ample loading docks, and energy-efficient designs.\n\nFounded in 1983 as Security Capital Industrial Trust, Prologis has grown via organic development, acquisitions, and strategic ventures. It operates through two segments: Real Estate (rental income from owned properties) and Strategic Capital (coinvestment funds like Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund). The company benefits from secular tailwinds like e-commerce penetration (now ~16% of U.S. retail sales) and supply chain reshoring. Prologis differentiates via scale, proprietary data analytics (Prologis Waypoint platform for tenant optimization), and sustainability initiatives (e.g., 40% renewable energy coverage goal by 2025). With a market-leading 97%+ occupancy and rent growth, PLD delivered Q2 2024 core FFO of $1.68/share (up 14% YoY), underscoring resilience amid high interest rates. Analysts view it as a defensive growth play in REITs, though sensitive to rate cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 17, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Core FFO $1.68/share (+14% YoY); net effective rent change 15.7%;

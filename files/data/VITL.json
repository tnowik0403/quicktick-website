(NASDAQ: VITL) is a Certified B Corporation and Certified Humane brand specializing in pasture-raised eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, and liquid whole eggs, emphasizing ethical animal welfare and regenerative agriculture. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company sources from a network of family farms where hens roam pastures for at least 108 square feet per bird, contrasting with conventional caged egg production. Vital Farms distributes through ~24,000 grocery stores, foodservice outlets, and clubs nationwide, including major chains like Whole Foods, Target, and Costco. In 2023, it achieved $414 million in net revenue, capturing a leading position in the ~$500 million U.S. pasture-raised egg category (est. 6-7% of total $12B+ egg market). The company's growth is fueled by premium pricing (2-3x conventional eggs), expanding retail footprint, and product diversification amid rising consumer demand for ethical, traceable foods. It operates 9 processing facilities and oversees 380+ farms, with a vertically integrated supply chain for quality control. Vital Farms went public in 2020 and has scaled rapidly, posting 30%+ YoY revenue growth in recent quarters, though profitability pressures from input costs persist.

(NASDAQ: CASY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024 close, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Closing Price   | $392.50       |\n| Market Cap      | $14.52B       |\n| 52-Week High    | $405.08       |\n| 52-Week Low     | $272.28       |\n| Avg.

(CASY) is a Fortune 500 convenience store retailer operating approximately 2,900 stores across 20 states, primarily in the Midwest and Southern U.S. (e.g., Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Texas). The company generates revenue from inside sales (prepared foods, groceries, beverages, tobacco, and general merchandise) and fuel sales. Prepared foods, led by private-label pizza—ranking #5 in U.S. pizzeria sales per Technomic—are a key differentiator, comprising ~32% of inside sales. Fuel remains the largest revenue driver (~60%), though margins are volatile. Casey's emphasizes a \"clean, friendly, convenient\" store model with 24/7 operations, self-checkout tech, and a robust loyalty program (Casey's Rewards, 7.5M+ members as of Q1 FY2025). \n\nFounded in 1959 in Iowa, Casey's has grown via organic new builds (60-70/year), tuck-in acquisitions, and larger M&A. FY2024 revenue reached $15.0B (verified Q4 FY2024 earnings, June 11, 2024). The company targets Same-Store Inside Sales growth of 6-10% annually, leveraging food innovation and digital tools. Expansion into Sun Belt states (e.g., Texas via recent deals) diversifies from core Midwest. With a debt-to-EBITDA of ~2.0x and consistent dividend growth (3.5% yield), Casey's balances growth with shareholder returns. It competes in a fragmented $800B+ U.S. convenience channel, holding leadership in rural/suburban markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported Sept 4, 2024; quarter ended July 31, 2024)**: Revenue $3.91B (+7.8% YoY); Inside sales $1.41B (+10.7% YoY, +9.1% SSS); Fuel gallons 596.5M (-1.3% YoY); Gross profit $1.05B (+12.4% YoY); Operating income $270.2M (+20.1% YoY); Diluted EPS $4.52 (+26.4% YoY).

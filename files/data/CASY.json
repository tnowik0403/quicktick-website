Company Overview\n\nCasey's General Stores, Inc. operates convenience stores under the Casey's and Casey's General Store names in the United States, offering pizza, donuts, breakfast items, and sandwiches; and tobacco and nicotine products. Headquartered in Ankeny, Iowa, the company operates approximately 2,900 convenience stores in 19 states. The business model centers on three key profit drivers: fuel, prepared food, and general merchandise, delivering essential goods and services in a single, convenient stop.\n\nEarly on, Casey's chose to build stores in towns with populations of 5,000 or less, which larger chains ignored. This strategy gave them a near-monopoly on convenience in many rural markets. Approximately 2/3 of Casey's stores are still found in areas with populations of 20,000 or fewer. Moving beyond just fuel and packaged goods to become the fifth-largest pizza chain in the U.S. is a major operational pivot. This high-margin food service business helped drive the company's fiscal 2025 Net Income to $546.5 million.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nCasey's General Stores (CASY) stock is priced at $636.00, giving the company a market capitalization of 23.2B. Casey's General Stores market cap as of January 14, 2026 is $22.84B. Price: $625.39 (Jan 21, 2026), Shares Outstanding: 37.07M, Market Cap: $22.96B, Price/Earnings (Normalized) 37.99, Price/Sales: 1.38\n\nOver the past 52 weeks, Casey's General Stores (CASY) stock has traded between a high of $647.99 and a low of $372.09. Its market cap has increased by 57.56% in one year.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company's stores provide soft drinks, energy, water, sports drinks, juices, coffee, and tea and dairy products; beer, wine, and spirits; snacks, candy, packaged bakery, and other food items; ice, ice cream, meals, and appetizers; health and beauty aids, automotive products, electronic accessories, and housewares. Its stores offer motor fuel for sale on a self-service basis; gasoline and diesel fuel; and ATM, lotto/lottery, and prepaid cards, as well as car wash services.\n\nAmong the most popular of Casey's prepared foods are its made-from-scratch pizzas, donuts, and sandwiches. A monthly subscription car wash service has been launched to create recurring revenue. Casey's operates from three company distribution centers, enabling an approximate delivery of 70% of in-store products as well as 60% of fuel.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nCasey's 2024 Product Innovation Summit selected 20 new suppliers. Guests can begin looking for new store products in the coming months. Suppliers interested in participating in Casey's 2025 Innovation Summit can watch for details to release in the Fall.\n\nThe company is exploring emerging revenue opportunities such as EV charging stations. Casey's committed to a roughly $150 million conversion and remodel effort to rebrand all CEFCO locations to Casey's, install kitchens (for pizza and foodservice), and align store operations. As of mid‑2025, Casey's said it will start rebranding \"in earnest\" at the beginning of the next calendar year. The rebranding and remodeling process, including kitchen installation and operational transitions, is expected to take 3-4 years to complete across the full set of CEFCO stores.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe Casey's Rewards loyalty program, which has grown to over 9 million members as of fiscal year 2025, uses data to personalize promotions and drive repeat business. Store Expansion: The company executed a record year of expansion in FY 2025, constructing or acquiring 270 stores, including the significant acquisition of 198 CEFCO convenience stores.\n\nLooking ahead, Casey's plans to open at least 80 more stores in fiscal 2026 through a mix of new builds and acquisitions, bringing its three-year strategic plan total to around 500 stores. The company expects inside same-store sales to grow 2%–5% and projects 10%–12% EBITDA growth.\n\n\"Goodstop by Casey's\" locations, launched in fiscal 2021, are designed for smaller-footprint stores that aren't a fit for the convenience-store chain's signature foodservice offering.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCasey's serves retail customers directly through its convenience stores. The company focuses primarily on rural and smaller community markets. About two-thirds of the company's gross profit stems from in-store sales of grocery items, prepared meals, and general merchandise. The Casey's Rewards loyalty program, which has grown to over 9 million members as of fiscal year 2025, uses data to personalize promotions and drive repeat business, particularly in the high-margin prepared food category.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results (Q2 2026):\nEBITDA: $410 million, a 17.5% increase from the prior year. Total Revenue: $4.51 billion, a 14.2% increase from the prior year. Inside Sales: $1.66 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year.\n\nDiluted EPS of $5.53 up 14.0% from the same period a year ago. Net income was $206.3 million, up 14.0% from the prior year, and EBITDA was $410.1 million, up 17.5%, from the same period a year ago.\n\n### Fiscal Year 2025 Performance:\nFiscal year 2025 results—a record $546.5 million in net income on $15.941 billion in annual revenue. In 2025, Casey's General Stores's revenue was $15.94 billion, an increase of 7.25% compared to the previous year's $14.86 billion. Earnings were $546.52 million, an increase of 8.87%.\n\n### Updated Guidance:\nAs a result of the strong financial performance year-to-date, fiscal 2026 EBITDA is expected to increase 15% to 17%. The Company now expects inside same-store sales to increase 3% to 4% and an inside margin of 41% to 42%. The tax rate is now expected to be 24% to 25% for the fiscal year.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- The 2025 Convenience Store Trends Report found that 85% of U.S. shoppers have tried made-to-order food at a convenience store, and nearly three-quarters of respondents view c-stores as an alternative to QSRs, up from 56% in 2024.\n- Casey's navigates fluctuating commodity prices and labor pressures by investing in employee recruitment and retention. It also focuses on high-margin prepared foods to offset fuel price volatility.\n- Casey's has a strong balance sheet and owns nearly all of its assets, which allows the company to consistently take advantage of growth opportunities.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- Economic factors also pose a risk; notably, the lingering impacts of inflation are affecting consumer purchasing power and could impact its margins.\n- Casey's faces internal challenges tied to integrating these new acquisitions smoothly, along with managing costs.\n- Same store operating expenses, excluding credit card fees, increased by 4.5%, indicating rising costs. Prepared food and dispensed beverage margins decreased by 10 basis points from the prior year. The integration of CEO stores is impacting margins negatively, as they currently have lower margins compared to Casey's stores.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n7-Eleven leads with 12,414 stores (8.2% market share), followed by Circle K & Casey's in the 152,255-store U.S. market. The new list shows the top three positions holding steady with 7-Eleven, Circle K and Casey's General Stores leading the industry. 7-Eleven Inc. 12,600; Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. 7,107; Casey's General Stores Inc. 2,890\n\nAs of Q4 2024, Casey's General Stores held a market share of 36.59% within its specific peer group in the retail sector. These three companies account for a combined 21,119 stores of the industry's 152,192 total locations or 13.87%.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nCasey's General Stores ranks as the third-largest convenience store retailer and the fifth-largest pizza chain in the United States. Casey's is the largest convenience store chain in the Central U.S. It may not have the coast-to-coast visibility of 7-Eleven or Circle K, but in small towns across the heartland, Casey's is the go-to gas station, grocery stop, and pizza joint all rolled into one.\n\nKey players in the convenience store market alongside Casey's include 7-Eleven, Circle K, Murphy USA, and QuikTrip. Wawa and Sheetz are notable for their strong foodservice programs, directly competing with Casey's prepared food offerings. The companies that are the largest in the industry such as 7-Eleven, Circle K, and Casey's General Stores are not only the largest but also the most influential. These companies are benefiting from customers' preference for quick and multipurpose options.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Major Acquisitions:\nOn July 26, Casey's announced it had agreed to acquire Temple, Texas-based Fikes Wholesale Inc., owner of CEFCO Convenience Stores, in an all-cash transaction for $1.145 billion.

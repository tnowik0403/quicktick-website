(AMG) is a leading global asset management firm that operates as a \"partnership\" platform, acquiring minority stakes (typically 51-65%) in high-performing independent boutique investment managers (affiliates). Founded in 1993 and headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, AMG provides affiliates with operational support, including sales, marketing, product development, risk management, and capital access, while preserving their entrepreneurial culture and investment autonomy. As of Q2 2024, AMG's affiliates collectively manage approximately $711 billion in assets under management (AUM), spanning equities (U.S., international, emerging markets), fixed income, alternatives (including credit, private equity, real assets), and multi-asset strategies. Revenue is primarily earned through incentive allocations (40-50% of affiliate profits above hurdles), investor fees (20-30%), and portfolio management fees. AMG's model emphasizes long-term alignment via equity ownership and governance rights, enabling scalable growth without direct portfolio management. This structure has delivered compounded AUM growth of ~15% annually since inception, positioning AMG as a consolidator in a fragmented $120+ trillion global asset management industry.

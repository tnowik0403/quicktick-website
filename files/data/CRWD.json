Company Overview\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is an American cybersecurity technology company based in Austin, Texas. It provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to reinvent security for the cloud era. Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches.\n\nWith our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as laptops, desktops, servers, virtual machines, and Internet of Things, or IoT, devices. We offer 32 cloud modules on our Falcon platform via a SaaS model that spans multiple large security markets, including corporate endpoint security, security and IT operations, managed security services, observability, cloud security, identity protection, threat intelligence, data protection and cybersecurity generative AI.\n\nThe company operates through a network effect business model, where when a client gets attacked, the company gathers information from that attack and learns from it, generating better solutions for all of CrowdStrike clients based on one single event experienced by one client. In a sense, CrowdStrike and its clients are benefitting from the network effect, which means that the value of the platform increases as it grows in size.\n\n## 2.

Growth Strategy\n\n### Platform Consolidation Strategy:\nOur single platform strategy coupled with the Falcon Flex subscription model unlocks consolidation, positioning CrowdStrike as the operating system of cybersecurity.\n\n### AI-First Approach:\nCrowdStrike's NVIDIA partnership, announced in October 2025, expands the company's push into agentic AI. The two companies will deliver always-on, continuously learning AI agents for real-time threat detection across cloud, data center and edge environments. This aligns favorably with CrowdStrike's progress with Charlotte AI, which grew more than 85% from the previous quarter as customers used more automated SOC features.\n\n### Partner-Driven Growth:\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2026, around 60% of new business came through partners, showing the importance of strategic partnerships to the company's growth strategy.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Current Major Partnerships:\n- **AWS**: CrowdStrike as the first cybersecurity partner to deliver an integrated SIEM through an enhanced version of SaaS Quick Launch in AWS Marketplace. Awarded AWS's Global Marketplace Partner of the Year and Global Security Partner of the Year.\n- **EY**: Announced that EY US has selected Falcon Next-Gen SIEM as the foundational platform powering its global cybersecurity managed services.\n- **KPMG**: KPMG is expanding its cybersecurity services with the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, including integrating Falcon Next-Gen SIEM into its professional service offerings.\n- **Amazon Business Prime**: Earlier in 2025, the companies announced that Falcon Go, CrowdStrike's AI-powered security offering, would be included in every Amazon Business Prime subscription.\n\n### Global System Integrators:\nErnst & Young LLP (EY US) received the Global System Integrator of the Year award at the 2025 Americas Partner Awards. Accenture was named Partner of the Year, and Deloitte secured the Canada Partner of the Year award in the same 2025 recognition cycle.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 FY2026 Results (ended October 31, 2025):\n- **Total Revenue**: Total revenue was $1.23 billion, a 22% increase, compared to $1.01 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: ending ARR of $4.92 billion, which accelerated to 23% growth year-over-year\n- **Net New ARR**: record Q3 net new ARR of $265 million, accelerating to 73% year-over-year growth\n- **Cash Flow**: Delivers record cash flow from operations of $398 million and record Q3 free cash flow of $296 million\n- **Falcon Flex ARR**: Exceeds $1.35 billion in ending ARR from accounts that have adopted the Falcon Flex subscription model, growing more than 200% year-over-year\n\n### Profitability:\nNon-GAAP operating income rose to 264.6 million USD, with an operating margin of 21% (up 1 p.p. year-on-year), while non-GAAP net income totalled 245.4 million USD. This indicates that, on an adjusted basis, the business is already consistently profitable while sustaining double-digit revenue growth.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n### Endpoint Security Market Position:\nAmong the seven public companies with a market cap greater than $10B, Palo Alto Networks leads with a 9% market share, followed by Fortinet (7%) and Microsoft (6%). CrowdStrike appears to be positioned as a strong competitor in this space.\n\n### Module Adoption:\nThe data on deep module adoption illustrates this consolidation: Customers using six or more modules reached 49% as of the third quarter of fiscal 2026. Customers using seven or more modules stood at 34%. Customers using eight or more modules reached 24%.\n\n### Next-Gen SIEM Growth:\nDuring the second quarter, annual recurring revenues for Next-Gen SIEM rose more than 95% year over year, reaching more than $430 million\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors:\n- **Palo Alto Networks (PANW)**: While CrowdStrike is often seen as the \"gold standard\" for lightweight endpoint protection, PANW wins on its ability to offer a \"full-stack\" solution including network and cloud.\n- **Fortinet (FTNT)**: Dominates the mid-market and branch-office segments. Fortinet's use of custom ASIC chips allows it to lead on price-to-performance, but it is often viewed as trailing Palo Alto in high-end AI and SOC automation.\n- **Microsoft**: Considered a major threat due to financial resources and integrated offerings\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\nThe Falcon Agent sets CrowdStrike apart from competitors as CrowdStrike is \"the only EDR [Endpoint Detection and Response] out there right now, which has good product parity on all operating systems\"\n\nCrowdStrike is the dominant name in endpoint detection and response (EDR) and a leading vendor in extended detection and response (XDR) and next-gen SIEM. CrowdStrike's Falcon platform was built in the cloud from day one, using lightweight agents on endpoints and a data lake back end.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Major Acquisition (January 2026):\nCrowdStrike Holdings announced its acquisition of identity security startup SGNL for $740 million, a move aimed at enhancing its cybersecurity tools to better combat AI-driven cyber threats.

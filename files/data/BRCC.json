(NYSE: BRCC), founded in 2014 by U.S. military veterans, is a rapidly growing premium coffee company targeting a patriotic consumer base including veterans, first responders, law enforcement, and Second Amendment enthusiasts. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, BRCC roasts small-batch, specialty-grade coffee and sells through three primary channels: direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce, wholesale partnerships (grocery, convenience, mass retailers), and 300+ brick-and-mortar Black Rifle Coffee Company cafes across 25 states. The company emphasizes high-quality Arabica beans sourced globally, with roasting in U.S. facilities. Beyond coffee (whole bean, ground, K-Cups), BRCC offers ready-to-drink (RTD) cold brew and energy drinks, apparel, knives, and outdoor gear via its \"Coffee & Lifestyle Brand\" positioning. In 2023, wholesale revenue overtook DTC as the largest segment, reflecting scale-up in national retail distribution. BRCC went public via SPAC merger in Feb 2022 at ~$10/share.

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(FORR) is a leading independent research and advisory services firm founded in 1983 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company empowers business leaders in marketing, customer experience (CX), sales, product management, and technology to make data-driven decisions through proprietary research, consulting, events, and benchmarking tools. Forrester serves over 700 clients globally, primarily large enterprises across technology, telecommunications, consumer products, financial services, healthcare, and retail sectors in the US (80% of revenue), EMEA, and APAC.\n\nCore offerings include subscription-based research reports (e.g., Wave™ evaluations, Predictions reports), the annual CX Index (measuring customer sentiment for 500+ brands), custom consulting, and events like CX Summit North America. In 2023, Research & Advisory generated 81% of revenue ($402M), Events 10% ($52M), Consulting 6% ($29M), and Data & Index Solutions 3% ($15M). Forrester differentiates via its \"customer-obsessed\" focus, with tools like the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) studies quantifying ROI for tech investments.

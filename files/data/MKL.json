The program pairs Markel's environmental underwriting experience with Greenhouse Specialty's selective distribution model and underwriting technology platform to streamline placement and support brokers.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nMarkel's renewed emphasis on disciplined specialty insurance underwriting could reshape its existing investment narrative and medium-term outlook. The changes follow the appointment of Simon Wilson as chief executive officer of Markel Insurance in March and are part of a strategy to simplify and grow the business by giving local teams a greater degree of empowerment and accountability to serve the needs of their customers. \"The best way to profitably grow a specialized and diversified business like ours is to equip and empower our local experts to serve the needs of the customers that they know best,\" said Wilson.\n\nAlso, this quarter, we took another step to simplify the structure of our insurance business by placing reinsurance into run-off. That decision enables the team to focus more clearly on the core underwriting activities where we have distinct strengths. Markel Group anticipates continued improvement in its attritional combined ratio in the second half of 2025, with further progress expected in 2026. The company is also focusing on running off its global reinsurance book over the next two to three years, maintaining investment flexibility, and continuing its share repurchase program.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMarkel's diversified client base spans multiple sectors.

This unit includes international general liability treaty, professional liability treaty and specialty treaty. Specific major clients are not disclosed due to the nature of the insurance business, but the company serves commercial customers, individuals, multinational companies, national industries, and various governmental entities.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nMarkel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL) reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2025 on October 29, 2025. Operating revenues increased 7% for the quarter and 4% year to date. As of 30-Sep-2025, Markel Group has a trailing 12-month revenue of $16.1B. The trailing twelve month revenue for Markel Group is $16.1B. Markel Group's EPS for 12 months was $166.99. \n\nWe're seeing improvement in our insurance combined ratio. And $2.1 billion in operating cash flow has helped fund continued steady share repurchases. For Q3 2025, Markel reported an 11% increase in gross written premiums and a 6% rise in operating revenues. Adjusted operating income surged 55% to $428 million, driven by stronger underwriting performance and higher investment income. The combined ratio improved to 93%, down four points from the same period last year, reflecting enhanced underwriting discipline and lower catastrophe losses.\n\nToday we announced operating earnings in excess of $3.7 billion for 2024, and our stock price has increased over 30% since the beginning of 2023. In the 2024 fiscal year, Markel reported total assets of approximately $50.5 billion and shareholders' equity of around $14.2 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- This is a cyclical industry, and the sector benefits when there is 'hard market', characterized by strong premium rate increases that outpace loss and cost inflation, resulting in robust underwriting margins.\n- Interest rates also matter, as they determine the yields earned on fixed-income portfolios.\n- This specialty focus allows Markel to develop expertise in niche markets where competition is less intense and pricing can be more favorable.\n- The recent leadership reshuffle across Markel Insurance, with new regional and product heads appointed in US Wholesale and Specialty, ties directly into this underwriting-first pivot.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- P&C insurers face a major secular headwind from the increasing frequency and severity of catastrophe losses due to climate change. Furthermore, the liability side of the business is pressured by 'social inflation'—the trend of rising litigation costs and larger jury awards.\n- Competitive pressures in the property market could impact profitability. Expense ratio challenges may affect operational efficiency. Economic uncertainties could influence market dynamics and demand.\n- The refocus on higher-margin specialty insurance and exit from loss-making reinsurance supports the key near term catalyst of better underwriting results, but it does not remove the biggest risk that legacy books and runoff operations could still produce adverse reserve surprises.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWhile specific market share percentages are not disclosed, Markel International is a specialist insurer, operating in the London Market, the US, APAC and MENA, underwriting through our trusted Lloyd's of London Syndicate or other group companies, dependent on where you are in the world.

The company operates in specialty niches where competition is typically less intense, allowing for better pricing power.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nMarkel's competitors in the specialty insurance market include Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB), W.R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB), and American Financial Group (NYSE:AFG). In its investment and business ownership model, it competes with diversified insurance operators like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B).\n\nIts total shareholder return for the last 15 years is 303% versus 658% for WR Berkley and 844% for American Financial Group. It also trails the S&P 500 at 378%. The last five years have been underwhelming from a share price perspective with the total return at only 27%, most of that driven with a strong year-to-date gain of 17%, with the firm again behind benchmarks over that multi-year period.\n\nUnderwriting performance has typically bettered the US commercial lines statutory average, with a 10-year simple average combined ratio of 95%, two percentage points better than the market average, and around 3.5 percentage points better for 2018-22. However, it has narrowly trailed WR Berkley, underperforming its combined ratio in eight of the last 10 years. Similarly, AFG outperformed Markel in seven of the last 10 years.\n\n## 11.

With the addition of Valor, that effort, known as Markel Ventures, has grown to include twenty businesses.\n\nMarkel Insurance (NYSE:MKL) has finalized the sale of its Global Reinsurance business renewal rights to Nationwide, as part of its strategy to streamline operations and focus on core specialty insurance markets. The transaction, initially announced on July 30, 2025, involves Nationwide delegating the underwriting and management of renewal policies to Ryan Re Underwriting Managers, a managing general underwriter of Ryan Specialty (NYSE:RYAN). While no insurance company entities were sold, Markel's Global Reinsurance division will enter runoff, with premiums expected to earn out over the next 2-3 years.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n\"I'm very pleased with our overall results and the progress we've made as a company this year,\" said Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. \"Revenues and adjusted operating income of our businesses are both up for the year and for the quarter.\n\nIn December 2024, JANA Partners publicly shared their perspectives on Markel Group and offered suggestions we might consider. We took this as an opportunity for broader self-reflection, in line with our commitment to the \"zealous pursuit of excellence.\" To that end, we have decided to conduct a review of our business.\n\nWe also elevated Simon Wilson as the new leader of our Markel Insurance business. Simon is a proven leader and winner – and he has a clear vision for how to profitably grow that business. Finally, while the strong tailwinds of the past few years have eased, results within our Ventures businesses continued to hold up well.\n\n## 13.

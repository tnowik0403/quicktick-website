(NASDAQ: UPBD), formerly Rent-A-Center, is a leading provider of lease-to-own (LTO) solutions in the U.S., operating through three primary segments: Acima (virtual LTO platform), Rent-A-Center (retail LTO stores), and Mexico (international retail LTO). The company enables consumers with limited credit access to acquire consumer goods like electronics, furniture, and appliances via flexible weekly/bi-weekly payments without long-term debt obligations. Founded in 1973 and rebranded in 2024 post a holding company restructuring, UPBD serves ~4 million customers annually across 2,000+ retail locations and a vast partner network of 20,000+ independent retailers via Acima's digital platform. Acima, launched in 2017, has driven digital transformation, contributing ~50% of revenue by enabling e-commerce integrations (e.g., with Wayfair, Big Lots). UPBD's model targets underserved \"non-prime\" consumers (FICO <660), generating high-margin recurring revenue through ownership transfers after 12-18 months. In FY2023, total revenue reached $3.75B, with a focus on portfolio yield optimization amid macroeconomic pressures. The firm emphasizes tech-enabled scalability, regulatory compliance, and portfolio health, positioning it in the $12B U.S. LTO market amid rising demand for alternative financing.

(VMD) is a leading provider of in-home respiratory care services in the United States, specializing in non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy for patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disease, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, the company operates a patient-centric model that combines medical equipment rental (primarily BiPAP and other NIV devices), 24/7 remote monitoring via proprietary software, nursing visits, and disease management protocols. This integrated approach emphasizes long-term patient adherence, reducing hospital readmissions and healthcare costs.\n\nViemed's business is heavily weighted toward Medicare patients (approximately 80% of revenues), leveraging CMS reimbursement for NIV setups under a bundled payment model introduced in 2019. The company serves over 20,000 active patients across 375+ dedicated territories, primarily in high-density COPD states like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. With a direct sales force of respiratory therapists (not traditional sales reps), Viemed achieves high retention rates (over 90% annualized) and focuses on organic growth through referrals from hospitals and pulmonologists. In FY2023, it generated $149M in revenue, positioning it as a nimble player in the $10B+ U.S. home respiratory market, which is shifting from acute care due to aging demographics and value-based reimbursement trends.

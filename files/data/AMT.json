Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Boston, MA, AMT primarily leases space on communications sites—such as towers, rooftops, and in-building systems—to wireless carriers, broadcasters, and other tenants for antennas and related equipment. As of Q3 2024 (ended September 30, 2024), AMT owns or manages approximately 226,000 communications sites across 26 countries, with key markets in the U.S. (40% of revenue), India (17%), Europe (15%), and Africa/Asia-Pacific/Latin America (combined 28%). The company generates revenue through long-term leases (average remaining term ~7 years), benefiting from high barriers to entry, recurring cash flows, and organic growth via tenant additions and upgrades. AMT's portfolio also includes edge data centers via its 2021 acquisition of CoreSite, positioning it for AI-driven demand. With a focus on 5G densification and hyperscale computing, AMT serves ~225,000 tenants, including all major U.S. carriers.

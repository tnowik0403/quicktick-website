Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nAmerican Tower has launched a \"Construction-Ready\" Initiative - a game-changing strategy for data center deployment that involves pre-zoning and pre-powering over 1,000 sites across the U.S. This initiative significantly reduces the time to bring new data center facilities online from 3-6 years to 12-18 months, crucial for meeting rapid scalability demands from enterprises and cloud providers for AI workloads and 5G densification.\n\nThe company is strategically positioned to capture incremental demand from next-generation technologies such as edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT). American Tower anticipates that AI and edge compute will drive further demand in mobile networks and data centers.\n\nAmerican Tower has identified more than 1,000 plots of land that it owns (or has long-term leases for) capable of delivering multiple-megawatt data centers. Today, the company has data centers in 12 U.S. markets, primarily from its acquisition of CoreSite.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation's growth strategy centers on maximizing the value of its existing assets while aggressively expanding its CoreSite data center segment, which is now the new engine of growth. The company is committing approximately $1.7 billion in total capital expenditures for 2025, with a significant $600 million directed specifically toward data center development. This focus is a direct response to the market's insatiable need for low-latency, high-capacity infrastructure to support AI workloads.\n\nOver 75% of AMT's discretionary capital is directed towards developed markets and data center expansion, prioritizing high-return projects. The company plans to deploy $1.7 billion in capital in 2025, with $600 million specifically allocated to data centers.\n\nThe company is actively pursuing strategic partnerships and innovations to capture AI-driven demand through formal alliances with giants like AWS and NVIDIA, positioning CoreSite to directly capture AI-related demand. A new \"Construction-Ready Sites\" initiative accelerates data center deployment to a rapid 12-18 months by utilizing pre-zoned U.S. locations.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2019, American Tower's top four tenants by total revenue were AT&T (22%), Verizon Wireless (15%), T-Mobile (10%) and Sprint (8%). Almost 65% of all cell towers in the United States are owned by either American Tower, Crown Castle or SBA Communications — companies most people have never heard of. These are the \"Big 3\" cell tower companies, and they don't have any customers in the traditional sense.\n\nAmerican Tower's customer base is predominantly business-to-business (B2B), consisting primarily of: Wireless Network Operators/Major Mobile Carriers: These are the largest and most crucial customers, leasing space on AMT's towers to deploy their antennas and other equipment to enable wireless communication services.\n\nMajor clients include all major U.S. carriers: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and historically Sprint. The company also serves international carriers, broadcasters, and government agencies across its global portfolio.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Latest Financial Results (Q3 2025):\nAmerican Tower reported Q3 2025 results with total revenue of $2,717 million (+7.7%) and total property revenue of $2,616 million (+5.9%). Adjusted EBITDA was $1,816 million (+7.6%) and AFFO attributable to common stockholders was $1,303 million (+5.3%), or $2.78 per share (+5.3%). Net income was $913 million (+216.9%), driven largely by foreign currency comparisons.\n\n### 2025 Guidance:\nManagement forecasting full-year 2025 total property revenue between $10.21 billion and $10.29 billion, with Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share expected in the range of $10.60 to $10.72.\n\n### Debt and Leverage:\nTotal Debt (as of September 2025): $45.01 billion USD. Long-Term Debt (as of September 30, 2025): $34.851 billion, a 4.45% increase year-over-year. Net Leverage Ratio (as of September 30, 2025): 4.9x net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to third-quarter 2025 annualized Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nTotal Liquidity (as of September 30, 2025): Approximately $10.7 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n• **High Interest Rates**: Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs and can make the relatively high dividend yields of REITs less attractive. The company's high leverage ratio (5.1x net leverage) makes it susceptible to higher interest expenses, especially with substantial debt maturities in 2025 and 2026.\n\n• **Sprint Churn**: Sprint churn remains a significant near-term challenge for American Tower, with decommissioning activities expected to continue until the third quarter of 2025.\n\n• **Foreign Currency Risk**: Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations pose another risk to the company's international operations.\n\n• **Customer Concentration**: Dependence on Major Tenants: A significant portion of revenue comes from a few large wireless carriers, posing a risk if these carriers face economic difficulties.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n• **5G Expansion**: The rollout of 5G technology presents immense growth opportunities due to the increased demand for infrastructure.\n\n• **AI and Edge Computing**: Data Centers (CoreSite) segment driven by hybrid-cloud demand and AI-related workloads. Long-term increases in global connectivity, the persistent need for 5G rollouts, and particularly the surging demand for AI workloads are strong tailwinds for AMT.\n\n• **International Growth**: Emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Asia, offer significant growth potential due to increasing mobile penetration.\n\n• **Carrier Densification**: As mobile data traffic continues to surge and fixed wireless services gain traction, U.S. carriers are expected to invest in network densification. This trend is reflected in projected U.S. organic growth rates of +3.9%, +4.2%, and +4.7% for 3Q25, full-year 2025, and 2026, respectively.\n\n## 9.

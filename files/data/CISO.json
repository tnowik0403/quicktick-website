(CISO) is a U.S.-based managed cybersecurity services provider (MSP) specializing in integrated risk management (IRM) solutions for enterprises, particularly in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government. Founded in 1969 (as legacy entity) and restructured via SPAC merger with Crown Equity Holdings in December 2022, the company operates from Scottsdale, AZ, with ~200 employees. Core offerings include Managed Detection and Response (MDR), Penetration Testing, Incident Response (IR), Security Operations Center (SOC)-as-a-Service, Compliance Advisory (e.g., NIST, HIPAA), and a proprietary IRM platform combining AI-driven threat detection with human expertise. CISO targets mid-market to enterprise clients needing outsourced cybersecurity amid talent shortages and rising threats. Revenue is primarily recurring from MDR/SOC contracts (70-80% mix). The firm emphasizes \"offensive security\" (red teaming) alongside defensive services, differentiating via cost-effective, U.S.-based operations. In FY2023, it pivoted post-merger toward MDR expansion, but faces challenges from high debt (~$40M pre-restructuring) and execution risks in a hyper-competitive $50B+ cybersecurity services market growing at 12-15% CAGR.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 15, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q): Revenue $18.1M (+14% YoY from $15.9M); Gross profit $5.7M (31.5% margin, up from 28%); Operating loss $10.2M; Net loss $18.4M (vs. $11.0M YoY, widened due to $9.5M non-cash derivative losses).

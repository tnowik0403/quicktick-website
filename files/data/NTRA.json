(NASDAQ: NTRA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $122.97\n- Market Capitalization: $15.31 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $36.60 - $128.65\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 1.64 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNatera, Inc. (NTRA) is a leading precision diagnostics company specializing in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing, leveraging its proprietary cloud-based Constellation platform for massive parallel sequencing and AI-driven analytics. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Natera focuses on three core markets: oncology (molecular residual disease or MRD testing), women's health (non-invasive prenatal testing or NIPT), and organ health (transplant rejection surveillance). Its flagship products—Signatera (personalized MRD for cancer recurrence), Panorama (NIPT for chromosomal abnormalities), Prospera (kidney transplant monitoring), and Renasight (genetic testing for CKD)—enable early detection, personalized treatment, and improved outcomes with high sensitivity (>95% for many assays). In 2023, Natera processed over 2.5 million tests, serving 11,000+ clinicians globally. The company has disrupted traditional diagnostics by shifting to liquid biopsies, reducing invasiveness and costs. With 2,400+ employees, Natera reported explosive growth, driven by Medicare coverage expansions and international adoption. Revenue surged 52% YoY in Q2 2024 to $367.7 million (verified from Aug 7, 2024 earnings release), with oncology now ~60% of mix. Despite historical losses, Q2 marked profitability on adjusted metrics (Adjusted EBITDA $17.0 million). Natera's vision is to pioneer \"pan-cancer\" MRD and expand cfDNA to autoimmune/infertility, positioning it at the forefront of a $100B+ diagnostics market amid rising cancer prevalence and personalized medicine trends.

Daily Volume:** 451,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nPrelude Therapeutics Incorporated (NASDAQ: PRLD) is a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing oral small-molecule therapies targeting novel cancer dependencies to disrupt tumor proliferation and overcome resistance in genetically defined cancers. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company leverages proprietary protein degradation and targeted inhibition platforms to address \"undruggable\" targets. Its lead program, PRT811, is an oral protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibitor designed for spliceosome-mutant myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it selectively inhibits mutant cancer cells while sparing healthy wild-type cells. Prelude's pipeline also includes next-generation targeted protein degraders like PRT3789 (SMARCA2 selective degrader for SMARCA4-mutant solid tumors) and earlier-stage assets targeting tenascin-C (TN-C) for tumor microenvironment modulation.  \n\nThe company operates in the $200+ billion global oncology market, emphasizing precision medicine amid rising demand for therapies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. With no approved products yet, Prelude is pre-revenue, focusing R&D on Phase 1/2 trials. As of Q2 2024, it holds $260.3 million in cash, providing runway into 2027. Leadership includes experienced executives from Incyte and Novartis, with a lean team of ~100 employees. PRLD went public in 2021 via IPO, raising $328 million. Recent clinical data show PRT811's potential in high-unmet-need niches, positioning Prelude for partnerships or buyouts in a consolidating biotech sector.

Key data: 50mg BID safe, 36% ORR (EHA June 2024).\n- Platform tech: MTAP deletion-selective PRMT5 inhibition; targeted protein degradation (TPD).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **PRT3789**: SMARCA2 degrader, Phase 1 initiated Aug 2024 for SMARCA4-loss tumors (5-10% NSCLC/ovarian); combos planned 2025.\n- **PRT-ttn (Tenascin-C degrader)**: Preclinical; IND-enabling studies 2025 for tumor stroma targeting.\n- **Discovery pipeline**: 4+ programs in immuno-oncology/epigenetics (company site, Oct 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current**: Negligible (<1%) in $10B MDS/AML market; PRMT5 niche pioneer (no direct approved competitors).\n- **Forecast**: Potential 10-20% share in spliceosome-mutant MDS/AML by 2030 if approved (peak sales est. $500M-$1B per analyst models, e.g., HC Wainwright). Degraders could capture 5% in SMARCA4 solid tumors ($20B TAM). Growth: +15-25% CAGR through 2028 on approvals; decline risk if trials fail (50% biotech attrition rate).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Competitor (Ticker) | Key Asset                  | Stage/Status                          | Edge over PRLD                  | PRLD Edge                     |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Incyte (INCY)      | INCA949 (w/ Repare RP-6306)| Phase 1 PRMT5i combos                | Larger cash ($3B+); partnerships| Mutant-selective; oral monotherapy |\n| Amgen (AMGN)       | Degrader platform (early)  | Preclinical                          | Scale/resources                 | Advanced clinical data        |\n| Revolution Medicines (RVMD) | RLY-4008 (ex-Prelude PI3Ka)| Phase 1 (licensed from Prelude 2022) | PI3K focus                      | Broader degrader portfolio    |\n| Kura Oncology (KURA) | Menin inhibitors (MDS/AML)| Phase 2                              | Similar heme focus              | Novel PRMT5 mechanism         |\n\nPRLD differentiates via oral, mutant-selective PRMT5i (vs. IV competitors).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Licensed PI3Kα asset (RLY-4008) to Revolution Medicines (2022 deal, $100M+ milestones). Advisory collaborations with academia (e.g., spliceosome experts).\n- **M&A**: No recent activity; attractive takeover target (peers acquired at 2-5x mcap on Phase 2 data). Speculation on Big Pharma interest in degraders (BioPharmCatalyst, Oct 2024).\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: None (pre-commercial).\n- **Potential**: MDS/AML key opinion leaders (e.g., MD Anderson trials); partners like Revolution Medicines for co-dev. Commercial targets: US heme-onc networks (30% spliceosome-mutant prevalence). Big Pharma (Merck/Pfizer) for degrader licensing.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Pipeline Strength**: 3 clinical assets; high scientific validation (Nature publications on PRMT5).\n- **Management**: CEO Notis Ekaterios Ntais (ex-Incyte); 80% insider ownership alignment.\n- **IP**: Patents to 2040+ on PRT811/degraders.\n- **ESG/ Sentiment**: High short interest (10.2%, down from 15%); X/Reddit hype on EHA data; analyst consensus \"Buy\" (3 Buys, avg PT $8, per TipRanks Oct 2024).\n- **Risks**: Binary clinical outcomes; dilution risk if cash < $100M.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n**Buy Rating: 7/10 (Moderate Buy)**  \n- Rationale: Strong cash position funds catalysts (PRT811 data H2 2024, PRT3789 2025); undervalued vs. peers (EV/cash 1.2x vs. 2x sector); growth upside in precision heme-onc. Hold for risk-averse; buy for moderate risk/growth portfolio. Biotech volatility tempers to 7 (not 10 due to Phase 1/2 risks).  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $11.50**  \n- Based on rNPV model (50% PRT811 success prob., $800M peak sales; 20% PRT3789; 10x terminal multiple; 12% discount rate). Implies ~112% upside from $5.42. Comps: 3x cash + pipeline premium aligns with RVMD/KURA multiples post-data.",

(NASDAQ: VSAT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $13.62  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.73 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $9.54 - $23.82  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.82 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nViasat, Inc. is a global communications company specializing in satellite-based broadband connectivity and secure networking solutions. Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Carlsbad, California, Viasat designs, produces, and delivers high-capacity satellite systems, ground network infrastructure, and cloud-based analytics to serve commercial, government, and military customers worldwide. Its core businesses span three segments: (1) **Communication Services**, providing high-speed satellite internet to residential, enterprise, aviation, maritime, and cruise customers via geostationary (GEO) satellites like ViaSat-1/2 and the newer ViaSat-3 constellation; (2) **Satellite Services**, offering managed bandwidth and global coverage post-2023 Inmarsat merger; and (3) **Defense and Government Systems**, delivering resilient tactical communications, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), and anti-jam technologies for U.S. DoD and allies. With the May 2023 completion of its $7.0 billion all-stock merger with Inmarsat, Viasat now operates one of the largest commercial maritime and aviation satcom networks, boasting multi-orbit capabilities (GEO, LEO partnerships). The company faces intense competition from low-Earth orbit (LEO) players like SpaceX's Starlink but leverages its scale in high-throughput GEO satellites and government contracts for differentiation. Viasat's FY2024 revenue reached $4.28 billion (up 3% YoY), driven by aviation recovery and defense backlog, though burdened by $7.5 billion net debt from the Inmarsat deal. (Word count: 248)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Reported Q1 FY2025 results (quarter ended June 30, 2024) – Revenues $1.12 billion (up 4% YoY), adjusted EBITDA $172 million (margin 15.4%), net loss $1.09 billion due to non-cash Inmarsat PPA adjustments (source: Viasat earnings release, SEC 10-Q).\n- **September 17, 2024**: Announced FCC grant of market access for Inmarsat's spectrum in U.S., enabling expanded L-band services for IoT and aviation.\n- **October 1, 2024**: ViaSat-3 F1 satellite reached full commercial service after propulsion issue resolution in August, achieving 2.6 Tbps capacity (company press release).\n- **July 29, 2024**: Secured $100 million contract from U.S. Space Force for Beyond Line-of-Sight communications (DoD announcement).\n- **Ongoing (Q3 2024)**: Integration of Inmarsat progressing;

Amphenol (antennas); potential LEO tie-ups (OneWeb talks, Sept 2024 rumors).\n- **M&A**: Inmarsat acquisition (closed May 3, 2023, $7B); ST Engineering iDirect (2021, $1.65B); no major new deals in 2024.\n- **Major Clients**: U.S. DoD (40% revenue, e.g., $568M IDIQ contract 2023); JetBlue, Delta (IFC); Royal Caribbean (maritime); Inmarsat legacy (BP, Shell).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10** (Hold/Sell tilt). Fundamentals show recovery potential via ViaSat-3 and defense, but $7.5B debt, Starlink erosion, and FY25 EBITDA guidance ($900-950M flat) limit upside amid high leverage (4.5x). Moderate risk appetite favors waiting for Q2 FY25 (Dec 2024) debt reduction proof.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $18.50 (36% upside from $13.62). Based on 7x FY26E EBITDA ($1.1B est., consensus via Yahoo/Seeking Alpha), assuming 5% revenue growth to $4.6B and 20% synergies. DCF implies $16-21 range for growth portfolio. Risks: Starlink pricing wars could cap at $15.",

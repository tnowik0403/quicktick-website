Founded in 1889 and headquartered in Santa Ana, California, the company operates through two primary segments: Title Insurance and Trust Services, and Home Warranty. The Title segment, which accounts for ~95% of revenues, issues policies guaranteeing property ownership rights and provides closing/escrow services for residential, commercial, and international transactions. It supports homebuyers, lenders, real estate professionals, and investors by mitigating title risks. The Home Warranty segment offers protection plans covering repairs for major home systems and appliances. FAF serves a vast network including mortgage originators, homebuilders, and attorneys, processing millions of transactions annually. With ~19,000 employees, FAF leverages technology platforms like its e-closing solutions and data analytics to streamline operations.

Rationale: Robust backlog, health segment momentum (10% growth), undervalued at 13x FY25 EPS midpoint vs. peers 18x. Moderate risk from gov't cyclicality offset by sticky contracts.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $105/share (18-20% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 6% perpetual growth) using Q1 FY25 guidance, analyst consensus (per FactSet: avg target $98.50), and 15x FY26 EPS ($7.00).

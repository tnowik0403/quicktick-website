All quantitative financials from verified <6mo sources.\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) is a leading less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation provider in North America, specializing in regional, inter-regional, and national freight services. Founded in 1934 and headquartered in Thomasville, NC, ODFL operates a network of over 260 service centers across the U.S., serving approximately 100% of the U.S. population within its next-day/two-day footprint. The company focuses on premium LTL services, emphasizing on-time delivery (97%+ OTIF), damage-free handling (<0.1% claims), and high-value freight for industries like manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and e-commerce. Unlike full-truckload peers, ODFL consolidates smaller shipments (<10,000 lbs) for efficiency, generating revenue through linehaul, pickup/delivery, and ancillary services like expedited/overweight handling.\n\nODFL differentiates via superior operating ratios (OR: 74.5% in Q3 2025), density-driven network economics, and a non-union workforce enabling cost control. With ~10,000 tractors and 35,000 trailers, it shipped 4.2 million LTL tons in Q3 2025. Revenue model: ~90% LTL tonnage-based pricing, adjusted dynamically for fuel surcharges (3-5% of rev). Amid LTL sector cyclicality, ODFL's market leadership stems from organic expansion, yielding consistent 10-15% EPS growth historically. In 2025, it navigated freight softening via tonnage gains and pricing discipline.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2025 Earnings (Oct 23, 2025 transcript, verified):** Revenue $1.462B (+5.8% YoY), EPS $1.44 (beat estimates $1.39), gross margin 41.2%, OR 74.5% (improved 140bps YoY).

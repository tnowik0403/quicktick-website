Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\nEvergy announced third quarter 2025 GAAP earnings of $475.0 million, or $2.03 per share, compared to GAAP earnings of $465.6 million, or $2.02 per share, for the third quarter 2024. The company narrowed its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.92 to $4.02, primarily due to the impact of cooler than normal summer weather.\n\n### Annual Performance\nEvergy reported strong performance in 2024, with GAAP earnings of $873.5 million, or $3.79 per share, and adjusted earnings of $877.9 million, or $3.81 per share.

EVRG's payout ratio is 0.73 with a trailing dividend yield of 3.69%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Data Center Demand**: Evergy's work the past few years to improve utility rate regulation in Missouri and Kansas is starting to pay off, as large customers such as data centers request new energy infrastructure investment. Evergy's pipeline of data centers planned and under construction is one of the largest relative to its size in the US.\n- **Economic Development**: Management emphasized that its long-term fundamentals remain robust, supported by what it described as a \"generational economic development opportunity\" and the necessary investments to enable that growth.\n- **Clean Energy Transition**: Surging demand from data centers and commercial users, along with strong economic development, is set to drive substantial growth in revenue and earnings. Accelerated grid and clean energy investments, backed by robust regulatory support, will enhance capital recovery and provide stable, predictable financial returns.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Weather Impacts**: The company narrowed its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range due to weather headwinds, which negatively impacted results by $0.13 per share.\n- **Regulatory Environment**: The Missouri case went better than expected, but the returns allowed by the Kansas regulator were punishingly low. Though Evergy operates in a subpar regulatory environment, the utility is a good operator.\n- **Capital Requirements**: Regulatory lag and the need for equity and equity content financing options to fund capital requirements pose challenges to maintaining a strong credit profile.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nEvergy is the largest electric company in Kansas, serving more than 1.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Kansas and Missouri. The utility has a combined rate base of more than $20 billion, about half in Kansas and the rest split between Missouri and interstate transmission.\n\nWhile specific market share percentages aren't disclosed, Evergy holds a dominant position in its service territories across Kansas and Missouri, benefiting from regulated monopoly status in these regions.\n\n## 10.

(EVRG) is a regulated electric utility serving approximately 1.14 million customers across Kansas and Missouri, making it the largest utility in Kansas and a major player in Missouri. Formed in June 2018 through the merger of Kansas City Power & Light (KCP&L) and Westar Energy, Evergy operates an integrated business model encompassing generation, transmission, and distribution. Its generation fleet totals ~15,000 MW, including nuclear (1,200 MW Wolf Creek), natural gas, coal (phasing out), wind (3,500+ MW), and solar (expanding). The company maintains 12,500 miles of transmission lines and 48,000 miles of distribution lines.\n\nEvergy focuses on reliability, affordability, and sustainability, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 via its Clean Energy Blueprint and 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). It benefits from stable regulated returns (ROE ~10%) under Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) and Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) oversight. Retail sales mix: residential (38%), commercial (38%), industrial (17%), municipal/other (7%). Evergy's scale supports $4B+ annual capex for grid modernization, renewables, and load growth from data centers/AI. Amid sector electrification trends, it positions for steady 4-6% EPS growth through 2028.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings release (verified via SEC 10-Q and earnings call transcript on Evergy IR site).

Data centers could add 5-10% industrial share; renewables maintain competitive edge.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (2024 Est.) | EVRG | Ameren (AEE) | Alliant (LNT) | Sempra (SRE) |\n|--------------------|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Customers (M)**  | 1.14 | 2.4         | 1.0          | 40          |\n| **EPS Growth (5Y CAGR)** | 6%  | 7%          | 8%           | 9%          |\n| **Dividend Yield** | 4.4% | 3.5%        | 3.8%         | 3.2%        |\n| **Renewables %**   | 32%  | 25%         | 45%          | 20%         |\n| **P/E (Fwd)**      | 14.5 | 16.2        | 17.5         | 15.8        |\n\nEVRG trades at discount to peers on growth/renewables; stronger regional dominance but slower diversification.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships:** Wolf Creek Nuclear (47% owned with KCP&L); NextEra for solar PPAs; Meta/Facebook data center MOU (Kansas, 2023; expansion 2024).\n- **M&A:** No major deals in 2024. Acquired 600 MW solar from King Energy (Oct 2024, $500M est.). Past: 2018 merger. Potential: Smaller renewables tuck-ins.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current Majors:** Cessna/Textron (aviation), Spirit Aerosystems (industrial ~10% load); municipalities (Wichita, Topeka).\n- **Potential:** Data centers (Google, Microsoft RFPs; 2 GW pipeline per Q2 call); EV manufacturers (e.g., Panasonic/Tesla ties via Kansas incentives).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** A- MSCI rating; #1 utility for renewables addition (3 GW since 2018).\n- **Management:** CEO Terry Bassham (since 2022) praised for execution (Q2 call).\n- **Risks:** 60% Kansas exposure (pro-business regs); coal retirement capex overhang.\n- **Sentiment:** Positive online (Reddit r/stocks, Seeking Alpha: \"defensive yield play\"); analyst consensus Hold (12 Buy/10 Hold/1 Sell; avg PT $62.50 per Yahoo).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (Hold). Defensive utility with 4-6% yield + modest growth; limited \"strong growth upside\" (AI tailwinds offset by rates/regulation).

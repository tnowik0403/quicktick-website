(NYSE: GTY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and NYSE data):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $27.24  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.25 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $24.38 - $30.80  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 6.60% (quarterly dividend $0.45/share, ex-date Sep 23, 2024)  \n- **P/FFO (TTM)**: 13.2x  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nGetty Realty Corp. (GTY) is a self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in single-tenant net lease properties, primarily convenience stores (c-stores) and gasoline stations. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), GTY owns 1,015 freestanding properties across 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, totaling ~25 million square feet. These mission-critical retail assets benefit from long-term master lease agreements (average ~10-15 years remaining), where tenants cover all operating expenses, providing predictable cash flows.  \n\nHeadquartered in Jericho, New York, GTY traces roots to 1960s oil distribution before pivoting to REIT status in 1986. It generates revenue through base/escalating rents, percentage rent from sales thresholds, and property sales/redevelopments. Key strengths include 99% occupancy, tenant credit quality (investment-grade exposure via 7-Eleven), and resilience to e-commerce disruption due to drive-thru/quick-service demand. GTY's portfolio is 85%+ c-stores/gas, with diversification into quick-service restaurants (QSRs) and auto services. In a high-interest-rate environment, its conservative balance sheet (debt/EBITDA ~5x, 70% fixed-rate debt) supports steady dividends (52-year streak). GTY targets 4-6% annual AFFO growth via acquisitions and organic rent escalations.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings** (released July 30, 2024): Rental revenues $51.7M (+13.8% YoY), AFFO $24.0M or $0.74/share (+8.8% YoY), occupancy 99.2%.

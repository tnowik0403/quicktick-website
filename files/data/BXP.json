Strong gateway positioning and leasing momentum offer growth upside (15-20% total return potential via FFO growth + yield), but office risks warrant moderate risk caution. Outperforms sector amid recovery.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $88/share (20% upside). Based on 18x 2025E FFO ($4.90/share, per consensus), 5% terminal yield; DCF implies $85-92. Catalysts: Rate cuts, RTO acceleration. (Valuation cross-check: Bloomberg, FactSet Nov 2024)",

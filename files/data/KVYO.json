Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Boston, MA, Klaviyo enables brands to leverage first-party customer data for hyper-personalized marketing, capturing behavioral signals across online and offline touchpoints to drive repeat purchases and customer lifetime value (CLV). Its platform integrates seamlessly with over 350 e-commerce ecosystems, notably Shopify (powering ~70% of its revenue via integrations), enabling automated flows (e.g., abandoned cart recovery), one-off campaigns, and AI-powered segmentation/orchestration.\n\nWith 143,345 customers as of Q2 2024 (up 32% YoY), Klaviyo serves a spectrum from SMBs (90%+ of revenue) to enterprises like Mattel, Puma, and Rocket Companies. It processes 325B+ events annually, emphasizing privacy-compliant data (GDPR/CCPA-ready) amid cookie deprecation. Post-IPO in September 2023 (raised $576M at $30/share), Klaviyo has scaled via product-led growth, achieving $937M ARR (Q2 2024, +39% YoY).

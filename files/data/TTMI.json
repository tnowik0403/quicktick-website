EBITDA $105-115M.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy for Growth)**  \n  Rationale: Merger catalyzes 2x upside via CTV dominance, synergies, and 15%+ CAGR; undervalued at 1.0x EV/2025 Sales vs. peers' 3-5x. Moderate risk from regulatory approval (H1 2025) and ad cycles offset by $150M cash buffer and CTV tailwinds. Ideal for growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $13.50**  \n  (DCF-based: 20x 2025E Adj. EBITDA $140M post-synergies; aligns with analyst consensus targets $10-16). Implies ~85% upside from $7.28. Hold if risk-averse pre-close; sell only on merger failure.",

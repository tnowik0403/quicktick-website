(AESI) is a premier provider of proppant and logistics services to the upstream oil and natural gas industry, with a primary focus on the Permian Basin. The company operates integrated mine-to-wellsite solutions, producing high-quality frac sand (primarily 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh products) and delivering it via an extensive logistics network including unit trains, railcars, and last-mile trucking. AESI's operations span multiple mines in West Texas, such as the Warhawk, Kicker, and Shadowmine facilities, supported by proprietary stacking and transloading infrastructure. Formed through a business combination with SilverBow Resources and other assets (completed February 2024), AESI benefits from low-cost production (~$20-25/ton) and scale advantages in the world's most active shale play. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, vertical integration, and customer contracts with major E&P operators to ensure steady demand amid fluctuating commodity prices. With a fleet of over 2,000 railcars and 11 transload facilities, AESI handles ~20% of Permian proppant demand via rail logistics. As of Q2 2024, it reported strong financials driven by Permian frac intensity growth, positioning it for expansion in a basin expected to drive U.S. oil production records.

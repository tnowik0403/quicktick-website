Datacenter & Communications (Previously Networking)\n- **Primary Growth Driver**: Delivered 26% year-over-year growth in Q1 FY26, driven by record bookings for 800G and 1.6T transceivers. This segment grew 11% sequentially and 55% year-over-year in Q1, with five consecutive quarters of sequential growth.\n- **Key Products**: \n  - 800G and 1.6T optical transceivers\n  - VCSELs for datacom applications\n  - Optical circuit switches (OCS)\n\n### 2. Industrial (Materials & Lasers)\n- **Challenges**: Industrial-related markets saw a revenue decrease of 2% for the year, with a 2% sequential and 8% year-over-year decline in fiscal Q4. The company experienced a drop in silicon carbide demand during fiscal '25\n- **Future Outlook**: Industrial-related markets are anticipated to be flat to down, partly due to macroeconomic uncertainties and tariffs. However, over the long term, industrial segments are seen as growth opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Partnerships & Recent Developments\n\n### Apple VCSEL Partnership (August 2025)\nCoherent Corp announced a new multi-year agreement with Apple for VCSEL products, expected to generate revenue starting in the second half of calendar '26. Under the new agreement, Coherent will continue to produce vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that enable key features such as Face ID on iPhone and iPad devices shipped around the world.\n\n### Silicon Carbide Joint Venture\nDENSO CORPORATION and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation have agreed to invest an aggregate $1 billion in its silicon carbide business. Under the terms of the transaction, DENSO and Mitsubishi Electric will each invest $500 million in exchange for a 12.5% non-controlling ownership interest in the Business, with Coherent owning the remaining 75%.\n\n### Aerospace & Defense Divestiture\nCoherent has announced a definitive agreement to sell its Aerospace and Defense business to Advent for $400 million. The transaction, expected to close in Q3 2025, involves approximately 550 employees across 10 geographic sites.\n\n---\n\n## Growth Strategy & Market Position\n\n### AI Datacenter Opportunity\nOptical Circuit Switch, another product in COHR's arsenal, is vital for the AI datacenter. Per management, this product adds more than $2 billion in addressable market opportunity in the long run. Coherent's diverse product portfolio addresses the AI market directly. Per Grand View Research, the global AI market size is expected to see a CAGR of 30.6% through 2033. With the rising adoption of this technology, we expect Coherent's demand to climb further in the long run\n\n### Manufacturing Excellence\nA diversified global manufacturing footprint with significant U.S. presence provides a structural advantage over peers, particularly as geopolitical uncertainty and tariff policies create headwinds for less-resilient supply chains. This positions Coherent to capture share when competitors face disruption.\n\n### Market Size & Growth Projections\nThe global data center interconnect market was estimated at USD 10.12 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 20.37 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% from 2025 to 2030.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Key Competitors\n- **Lumentum (LITE)**: While customer forecasts extend through 2028 and demand remains \"exceptionally strong,\" competitors like Lumentum to capture share. Any misstep in yield, timing, or quality could cede share to competitors like Lumentum (LITE) in the critical 1.6T transition.\n- **II-VI**: While competitors like II-VI (IIVI) and Lumentum (LITE) face margin pressures from commoditization, Coherent's high-margin niches (e.g., AI-driven data centers and telecom upgrades) shield it from price wars.\n- **Chinese competitors in transceiver market**\n\n### Competitive Advantages\n- **Vertical Integration**: The industry structure favors vertically integrated players with manufacturing depth. While AI demand has created a transceiver market growing at 30-40% annually, supply chain fragility remains the primary constraint. Most competitors rely on external suppliers for critical components like indium phosphide lasers, creating vulnerability when demand surges. Coherent's strategy of internalizing key component production transforms this industry-wide constraint into a competitive advantage\n\n---\n\n## Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n✅ **AI Infrastructure Boom**: Record demand for high-speed optical transceivers  \n✅ **Supply Chain Resilience**: Diversified global manufacturing with U.S. presence  \n✅ **Margin Expansion**: 358 basis points improvement in FY2025  \n✅ **Strategic Partnerships**: Apple VCSEL agreement, Silicon Carbide JV  \n✅ **Market Leadership**: Coherent believes it gained market share in fiscal '25, especially in higher data rate transceivers. The company is well-positioned due to its technology roadmap and resilient supply chain\n\n### Headwinds\n❌ **Industrial Market Weakness**: Coherent Corp is taking a cautious view on the broad-based industrial market due to macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff concerns.  \n❌ **Execution Risk**: The primary risk to the thesis is execution failure on the capacity ramp. The simultaneous ramp of two 6-inch indium phosphide lines, expansion of transceiver assembly in Malaysia and Vietnam, and qualification of multiple 1.6T architectures create operational complexity.  \n❌ **Competitive Pressure**: Short-term risks from heightened competition and pricing pressure in optical components remain a constant backdrop. This range reflects management's ongoing confidence in AI-driven demand, even as it confronts revenue volatility and increasing margin pressures from global competitors\n\n---\n\n## Product Portfolio & Innovation\n\n### Current Product Lines\n1. **800G/1.6T Transceivers**: Saw a 51% revenue growth in the data center and communications market for fiscal '25, with a 39% year-over-year increase in Q4. The company began initial revenue shipments of its new 1.6T Transceivers and expects volumes to ramp throughout the year\n\n2. **Optical Circuit Switch (OCS)**: Coherent's OCS uses digital liquid crystal technology, which is non-mechanical and offers higher reliability compared to traditional MEMS-based solutions.\n\n3. **VCSELs**: Critical for Face ID technology and datacenter applications\n\n4. **Silicon Carbide**: For EV power electronics and industrial applications\n\n### Pipeline Products\n- **3.2T Transceivers**: Future generation for ultra-high-speed applications\n- **Co-packaged Optics (CPO)**: Coherent will exhibit at NVIDIA GTC DC 2025 showcasing its co-packaged optics (CPO) technologies. The exhibit highlights Coherent's CPO-enabling portfolio—lasers, precision optics, detectors, and thermal control solutions\n\n---\n\n## Market Share Analysis\n\n### Datacenter Transceivers\n- **Market Position**: While market share figures aren't disclosed, Coherent's 79% year-over-year datacom revenue growth in Q3 2025—driven by AI and telecom—speaks to its dominance. Analysts project the 800G/1.6T market to grow at a ~40% CAGR through 2033, with Coherent's technology breadth positioning it to capture a disproportionate share.\n\n### Geographic Revenue Mix\nIt generates maximum revenue from Networking segment. The company geographically operates in North America. Europe, China, Japan and Rest of the world.\n\n---\n\n## Financial Guidance & Outlook\n\n### Q1 FY2026 Guidance\nGuidance for Q1 Fiscal 2026 Revenue: $1.46 billion to $1.6 billion.

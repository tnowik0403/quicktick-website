Company Overview\n\nCoherent Corp. is a global leader in materials, networking, and lasers for the industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets. The company develops, manufactures, and markets engineered materials, optoelectronic components and devices, and laser systems. The company was formerly known as II-VI Incorporated and changed its name to Coherent Corp. in September 2022, following the acquisition of the original Coherent Inc. Coherent Corp. was incorporated in 1971 and is headquartered in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. It operates through three segments: Networking, Materials, and Lasers. The company has R&D, manufacturing, sales, service, and distribution facilities in 130 locations worldwide, with approximately 30,220 employees as of January 2026. The company's vertically integrated approach allows it to control the entire production chain from raw materials to finished products, giving it a competitive edge in specialized markets.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 9, 2026, Coherent's stock price is $178.06. The stock has shown significant volatility, with a 52-week range between $45.58 and $200.19, representing a 107.25% change over the past year. Market capitalization ranges from $27.21-$30.12 billion as of January 2026. The company's P/E ratio is 249.53, reflecting high growth expectations. The company does not pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Networking Segment\nThe Networking segment offers transceivers, systems, subsystems, modules, components, optics, and semiconductor devices for datacenter and communications applications. Key products include 800G and 1.6T transceivers, with silicon photonics and EML-based 1.6T ramping now, and 200G VCSEL-based 1.6T slated to ramp next calendar year.\n\n### Materials Segment\nThe Materials segment provides engineered materials, laser optics, thermoelectric components, and advanced ceramic and metal-matrix composite materials and products; and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser, edge-emitting laser, pump lasers, high-power lasers for materials processing, and integrated circuit. In its Materials segment, Coherent produces engineered substrates like silicon carbide (SiC), which are critical for electric vehicles and 5G wireless infrastructure. These materials enable more efficient power conversion in EV drivetrains and better performance in high-frequency communications equipment.\n\n### Lasers Segment\nThe Laser segment offers excimer lasers, solid-state lasers, CO2 lasers, and laser systems for various industrial applications, including semiconductor capital equipment, display manufacturing, precision manufacturing, and scientific research; and laser systems and subsystems. The Lasers segment serves industrial customers in semiconductor capital equipment, display capital equipment, precision manufacturing, and aerospace and defense, as well as instrumentation customers in life sciences and scientific research.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nCoherent shipped OCS systems to seven customers, including 64×64 and 320×320, with both revenue and backlog growing in fiscal Q1 and a revenue ramp expected throughout calendar 2026. In CPO/NPO, Coherent is sampling 400 mW CW lasers for silicon photonics, demonstrated 1.6T direct-detect links to 6 km using EMLs, and showcased next-gen 2D VCSEL arrays for near-packaged optics. The company expects to see initial CPO deployments in calendar 2026, with growth continuing in the following years, while pluggable form factors continue to grow in the scale-out portion of the network. Beyond optics, the company is also working to expand its data center solutions through the introduction of diamond silicon carbide composite materials. Designed to enhance thermal conductivity for cooling xPUs (processing units) in an AI data center, the technology aims to address thermal management challenges as AI workloads become more intensive and generate higher heat loads.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nCEO Jim Anderson emphasized that revenue growth is driven by strong demand from AI-related datacenters and communications, with the company continuing to see strong bookings and demand forecasts across data center customers as they invest in AI data center capacity expansion, believing both AI data centers and communications will be strong long-term growth drivers given the exceptional breadth and depth of their photonic technology. Coherent projects mid-teens top-line CAGR, with DC business driving high-teens CAGR, and expects gross margins to continue expanding from the current 38%. The company is poised to capitalize on the AI data center shift to silicon photonics and optical connectivity solutions. Twenty-three sites were sold or exited over the past five quarters with further asset streamlining planned to focus on the highest profit growth and asset efficiency.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Current Major Clients\nCoherent has a multi-year strategic supply agreement with Apple, continuing to produce vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that enable key features such as Face ID on iPhone and iPad devices shipped around the world. Top clients currently include Apple, Ford Motor Company, and Applied Materials. Coherent generated \"more than 10%\" of its revenue from its largest customer in fiscal 2023.\n\n### Potential Clients\nThe company sees strong demand for 1.6T transceivers across multiple customers and achieved record bookings in both data center and communications, including long-term customer orders and multi-year demand forecasts extending to 2028.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $1.58 billion, with GAAP gross margin of 36.6% and GAAP net income of $1.19 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 38.7% with net income per diluted share of $1.16. Coherent Corp reported a 19% year-over-year revenue increase on a pro forma basis, driven by strong demand in AI data centers and communications. EBITDA is $1.20 billion USD, and current EBITDA margin is 19.39%. The company successfully reduced its debt leverage ratio to 1.7 times, down from 2.4 times a year ago, through strategic divestitures and debt refinancing.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nCoherent is the volume leader with roughly 25% market share. When a hyperscaler like Microsoft needs to deploy 500,000 units of a specific transceiver yesterday, Coherent is often the first phone call. II-VI's acquisition of Coherent made it the world's largest photonics company - and that scale could give it an edge against Lumentum, MKS Instruments, and other major competitors. The report evaluates over 100 companies and categorizes the top 23 players as quadrant leaders. Key players in the market include Coherent Corp., Lumentum Holdings Inc., Broadcom, and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nCoherent's competitors include Lumentum Operations LLC and MKS Instruments in the photonics space, Wolfspeed in silicon carbide substrates, IPG Photonics in industrial lasers, and Broadcom and InnoLight Technology in optical communications components. Coherent Corp. remains the most formidable rival to Lumentum, often trading in lockstep. While Coherent holds a higher volume of the overall transceiver market, Lumentum has maintained a lead in the specialized laser chip sector. If Lumentum is the specialized laser engineer, Coherent is the industrial factory. Prominent players like Coherent Corp., Lumentum Holdings, and Broadcom dominate through strategic investments and partnerships, enhancing their global presence in this rapidly evolving sector.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn August 2025, Coherent entered a new multiyear strategic supply agreement with Apple, expanding their long-standing partnership. The acquisition of Avalon Photonics, Anadigics, and EpiWorks allowed II-VI to increase its production of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), important to 3D sensing technology; and the acquisition of Finisar Corporation in 2019 brought to II-VI Finisar's high volume 3DS VCSELs indium phosphide (InP) platform and its experience in integrating InP lasers with optics and electronics in transceivers. In 2022, II-VI acquired laser manufacturer Coherent, Inc. and took the name Coherent Corp.\n\n### Recent Divestitures\nIn August 2025, Coherent announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Aerospace and Defense business to Advent, a leading global private equity investor, for $400 million. Proceeds will be used to reduce debt, which will be immediately accretive to Coherent's EPS. The business includes approximately 550 employees and 10 geographic sites.\n\n## 11.

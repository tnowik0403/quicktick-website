Headquartered in New York City, ABM operates across the U.S. and select international markets, serving commercial, industrial, aviation, education, and manufacturing sectors. The company delivers end-to-end solutions through four segments: Business & Industry (B&I, ~55% of revenue: janitorial, maintenance, landscaping); Aviation (~20%: ground handling, baggage, fueling); Education (~15%: campus services); and Technology & Manufacturing (T&M, ~10%: mission-critical engineering for data centers, semiconductors). \n\nABM emphasizes high-margin, recurring revenue from long-term contracts (average 3-5 years), with a focus on ESG initiatives like energy efficiency and EV infrastructure. In FY2023 (ended Oct 31, 2023), it generated $8.0B in revenue, driven by organic growth and acquisitions. Recent shifts include divesting low-margin parking operations (sold to SP Plus in 2022) to prioritize technical services amid data center boom. ABM's 140,000+ workforce supports 20,000+ clients, leveraging digital tools like ABM OneView platform for predictive maintenance. Challenges include labor shortages, but tailwinds from U.S. infrastructure spending and hyperscale tech demand position ABM for mid-single-digit growth.

DCF-based (7% WACC, 4% terminal growth), incorporating Q3 guidance and 5% revenue CAGR to 2027.

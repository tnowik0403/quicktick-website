Growth Strategy\n\nPrudential Financial is shifting its resources to focus more on fast-growing areas, such as institutional retirement, group insurance, and investment management. This strategy aims to transform the business into a higher-growth, less market-sensitive, and more capital-efficient firm.\n\nThe company has made early progress towards achieving priorities by launching the integration of PGIM's multi-manager model into a single unified asset management business, including a $1 trillion public and private credit platform. Management is \"quickly evolving to a unified asset manager model in PGIM\" and has \"taken actions to drive margin expansion\" while \"addressing the global retirement opportunity with an increasingly diverse set of products and solutions.\"\n\nSustainable long-term growth is the ultimate goal. By growing, the company will be better positioned to help customers achieve long-term financial security and prosperity, while generating attractive returns for shareholders.\n\n## 6.

Individual Retirement sales exceeded $3 billion for the seventh consecutive quarter, demonstrating strong sales momentum. Prudential recently closed a Jumbo Pension Risk Transfer transaction, reinforcing its market leadership.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nThe company delivered a record-high adjusted operating income per share of $4.26, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and showcasing robust profitability across all key business segments. Prudential reported revenues of $16.24 billion, surpassing estimates of $14.28 billion. The financial services provider reported $4.26 earnings per share (EPS) for Q3, topping analysts' consensus estimates of $3.72 by $0.54. The company had revenue of $17.89 billion for the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $13.77 billion, with a net margin of 4.65% and a return on equity of 16.60%.\n\n**Capital Returns:**\nThe company's commitment to shareholder returns is expected to continue, with a consistent dividend payout and an ongoing $2 billion share buyback program. In Q3 2025 alone, Prudential returned a substantial $731 million to shareholders, comprising $250 million in share repurchases and $481 million in dividends.\n\n**Dividend Information:**\nThe company maintains a consistent quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share, with an annualized dividend of $5.40 per share offering an attractive dividend yield of approximately 5.1% to 5.19%. This declaration extends Prudential's impressive streak of 12 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Strong international presence providing more organic growth opportunities than peers, with expanding international business vital for long-term growth\n- Strong footprint in Japan offering attractive opportunities to capitalize on protection products and retirement needs, historically generating ROE in the 20% range, with Brazil gaining sufficient scale to become an important contributor\n- Growth driven by global demographic shifts, demand for private retirement solutions, and expansion into emerging markets with tailored insurance and asset management products. Investments in digital transformation and unified asset management are expected to lower costs, boost margins, and generate additional revenue through improved efficiency.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Jennison, the active equity manager, continued to experience outflows, which dampened organic growth and earnings momentum in PGIM. The International business in Japan faced a 6% decline in sales compared to the prior year quarter due to currency fluctuations.\n- The Group Insurance segment experienced unfavorable disability experience due to an uptick in severity and lower claim resolutions.\n- Recent preliminary fourth-quarter 2025 figures highlighted softer-than-anticipated alternative investment income, while its Japan life unit CEO resigned following staff misconduct issues that raised governance concerns.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe United States and Japan are Prudential's two largest markets. Its US business contributed about 50% of adjusted 2024 earnings and includes institutional retirement (mostly pension risk transfer), individual retirement (annuities), group insurance, and individual life insurance. Its international business represented about 40% of adjusted earnings, with a strong market position in Japan. The company's investment management business, PGIM, contributed approximately 10% of its 2024 adjusted earnings.\n\nPGIM is the 12th largest investment manager (out of 411 firms surveyed) in terms of worldwide institutional assets under management based on Pensions & Investments' Top Money Managers list. In 2019, Prudential was the largest insurance provider in the United States with $815.1 billion in total assets.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nPrudential's top competitors include Metlife, ING, Lincoln Financial, The Hartford, Travelers, AXA, AIG, Allianz, Fidelity Investments, Liberty Mutual, Allstate, Vanguard, Zurich, Aviva, CNA, Nationwide, Farmers Insurance, Principal, GEICO and New York Life.\n\nWhile MetLife Investment Management (MIM) is a powerhouse in real estate and private credit, Prudential's PGIM is one of the world's largest asset managers, often dwarfing MIM in total assets under management (AUM). Prudential was one of the first insurers to aggressively brand itself around \"Financial Wellness\" rather than just insurance, with their platform connecting a company's 401(k) offering directly with insurance products, creating a seamless ecosystem that MetLife's \"Upwise\" platform is racing to match.\n\nPRU shares are trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 7.62, which is lower than the industry average of 9.23X, the Finance sector's 17.51X and the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's 23.44X.

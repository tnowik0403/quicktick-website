(PRU) is a leading Fortune 500 financial services company headquartered in Newark, New Jersey, with operations spanning the U.S., Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Founded in 1875, it serves approximately 16 million customers through three primary segments: U.S. Businesses (retirement, life insurance, and group coverage), International Businesses (insurance and retirement in Asia and Latin America), and PGIM (global investment management with $1.3 trillion in assets under management as of Q2 2024). PRU offers a broad suite of products including individual life insurance, annuities (fixed, variable, and indexed), group life/disability insurance, and institutional investment solutions. The company generates revenue primarily from premiums, fees, and investment income, emphasizing capital-efficient growth in high-return markets like Japan and emerging Asia. In 2023, PRU returned $5.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Recent strategic shifts include divesting non-core assets (e.g., Hartford acquisition integration complete) to focus on retirement and international expansion, positioning it as a resilient player in a sector facing interest rate volatility and longevity risks. PRU's scale, diversified revenue (60%+ from recurring premiums), and strong balance capital ($5B+ excess) underpin its stability amid economic cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 23, 2024):** Adjusted operating earnings of $3.88 per share (beat consensus $3.64); net income $1.685 billion.

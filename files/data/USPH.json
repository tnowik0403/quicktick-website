(USPH) is a leading operator of outpatient physical therapy clinics in the United States, focusing on non-surgical musculoskeletal care. Founded in 1990 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company owns and operates approximately 565 clinics across 42 states as of Q2 2024, serving over 2 million patient visits annually. USPH employs a partnership model with ~95% of clinics managed by local therapist partners who own minority stakes, aligning incentives for quality care and retention. Services include orthopedic rehab, sports medicine, work injury treatment, and specialized therapies like hand therapy and women's health. The company generates revenue primarily from patient fees (paid by insurance, Medicare/Medicaid ~70%, and cash-pay), with a scalable model emphasizing organic growth via same-store visit increases and inorganic expansion through acquisitions and de novo (new) clinic builds. USPH benefits from the $45+ billion U.S. outpatient physical therapy market, driven by aging demographics and post-COVID rehab demand, while navigating reimbursement pressures. In Q2 2024 (reported August 7, 2024), revenue hit $133.9 million (+13.1% YoY), with clinic visits up 7.1% to 2.0 million annually run-rate, underscoring resilient demand amid labor challenges.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024)**: Revenue $133.9M (+13.1% YoY); net income $6.2M (EPS $0.43, beat estimates); gross margin 32.6%; adjusted EBITDA $20.7M (+17%).

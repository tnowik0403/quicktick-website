Operating through two main segments—Flight Support Group (FSG, ~50% of sales) and Electronic Technologies Group (ETG, ~50%)—Heico focuses on aftermarket solutions, including FAA-approved PMA (Parts Manufacturer Approval) parts, repairs, and overhauls for commercial and military aircraft. FSG serves airlines, air freight carriers, and defense customers with cost-effective alternatives to OEM parts, while ETG provides specialized components like electro-optical infrared simulation equipment, microwave filters, high-speed interface products, and connectors for aviation, defense, space, medical, and telecommunications applications.\n\nFounded in 1957 and headquartered in Hollywood, Florida, Heico has built a reputation for high-margin, niche dominance through organic growth and aggressive M&A. The company benefits from secular tailwinds in global air travel recovery and defense spending, with a dual-class share structure (HEI and HEI.A) enabling family control while providing liquidity. In FY2024 (ended Oct 31, 2023), Heico achieved record net sales of $2.92B (up 13%) and net income of $389.4M (up 8%), driven by aftermarket demand amid aging fleets and supply shortages. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended Jul 31, 2024, reported Aug 26, 2024), sales reached $838.8M (+14% YoY), operating income $221.7M (+20% YoY), and net income $121.2M (+38% YoY), with gross margins at 40.1%. Heico's strategy emphasizes 15-20%+ annual growth via acquisitions and market share gains in fragmented aftermarkets, positioning it as a resilient compounder in a $100B+ global aerospace aftermarket.

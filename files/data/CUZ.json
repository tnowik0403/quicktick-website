CUZ focuses on premium, amenity-rich urban and suburban office assets leased primarily to investment-grade corporate tenants in sectors like technology, financial services, healthcare, and professional services.  \n\nThe company's strategy emphasizes proactive leasing, targeted development, and portfolio optimization through acquisitions and dispositions to enhance net asset value (NAV) per share. With a portfolio occupancy of 88.1% at Q2 2024 (up from 86.9% YoY), CUZ benefits from Sunbelt demographic tailwinds, including population influx and job growth. Rental revenues reached $199.6 million in Q2 2024 (up 4.5% YoY), driven by rent bumps and lease-up activity. CUZ differentiates via its development pipeline (1.2 million sq ft under construction) and focus on \"flight-to-quality\" spaces amid remote work shifts. Risks include office sector vacancy pressures, but CUZ's high-barrier markets and 95%+ in-place rents from creditworthy tenants position it for recovery.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 24, 2024):** Reported AFFO of $0.92/share (beat consensus $0.88); net income $38.4 million; same-site NOI growth 5.2% YoY.

Rationale: Sunbelt tailwinds, leasing beats, and 10%+ AFFO growth outweigh sector headwinds; undervalued vs. 5% dividend yield + NAV discount.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $30.50 (18% upside from $25.85). Based on 18x 2025 AFFO ($1.70/share implied), discounted cash flow (7% cap rate on $800M NOI), and peer multiple expansion. Suitable for moderate-risk growth portfolios targeting 15% total return over 12-18 months.",

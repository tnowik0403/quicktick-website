(NASDAQ: BTM) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $1.72 (verified via Yahoo Finance/NASDAQ real-time quote as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $38.4 million (verified via Yahoo Finance/NASDAQ as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.36 - $4.67  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3-mo):** 347,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nBitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) is the leading operator of cryptocurrency kiosks (\"ATMs\") in North America, enabling cash-to-cryptocurrency purchases and cryptocurrency-to-cash sales. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company operates over 8,200 kiosks across 47 U.S. states and select Canadian provinces as of Q2 2024, representing the largest network by machine count. Users access Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other digital assets via cash deposits at kiosks, with transactions verified on the blockchain. BTM also runs an online platform (bitcoin.com/depot) for selling crypto for cash payouts at kiosks or via ACH/direct deposit.\n\nThe business model generates revenue primarily through transaction fees (5-20% spreads on crypto purchases/sales), with 90%+ from kiosks. In a fragmented $1B+ annual U.S. crypto ATM market (35,000+ total machines), BTM holds dominant scale, benefiting from crypto adoption trends. Amid Bitcoin's rally to $60K+ in 2024, volumes surged, though profitability remains challenged by high operating costs (rent, compliance) and crypto volatility. Public since Feb 2023 via SPAC merger with GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp., BTM targets retail unbanked/underbanked users seeking fiat-crypto onramps, positioning for growth in a projected $2.5B global crypto ATM market by 2028 (per recent industry reports from Coin ATM Radar).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released – Record revenue of $155.8M (+19% YoY), gross profit $17.4M (11.2% margin), net loss $4.2M (improved from $11.3M YoY).

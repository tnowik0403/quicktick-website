As of Q2 2024, NSA owns interests in 1,117 self-storage properties totaling ~71 million rentable square feet across 42 states and Puerto Rico, serving ~490,000 customers. Revenue is generated primarily from rental income (96% of total), with units averaging 85-90% occupancy. NSA targets Same-Store NOI growth via revenue optimization (dynamic pricing, ancillary sales) and expense controls. The company differentiates through a decentralized JV model, allowing affiliates to contribute properties for equity stakes, fueling inorganic growth. With a fleet of climate-controlled units (~62% of portfolio), NSA benefits from defensive demand drivers like life events (moves, downsizing) and business storage needs. Dividend yield stands at ~5.3% ($2.24 annualized), appealing to income investors, though leverage (net debt/EBITDA ~6x) reflects acquisition appetite amid moderating sector supply.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release (verified SEC 10-Q).

Aligned with Stifel/Wells Fargo PTs; strong growth for moderate-risk portfolio targeting REIT recovery.)",

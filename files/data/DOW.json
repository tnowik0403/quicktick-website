No major 2024 deals.\n- **Current Major Clients:** Procter & Gamble (consumer packaging), Ford/GM (auto elastomers), Owens Corning (insulation), Saint-Gobain (coatings).\n- **Potential Clients/Growth:** EV battery makers (e.g., LG Energy via silicones); renewable packaging firms (e.g., Nestle commitments for 2025 recycled content).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG Rating:** MSCI AA (leader in chemicals); 2024 CDP Climate A- score.\n- **Management Quality:** New CEO Kelly (CFO background) focused on capital allocation; returned $2.5B to shareholders YTD 2024 (dividends/buybacks).\n- **Risks:** Cyclicality (beta 1.4); regulatory (PFAS scrutiny, EU CBAM tariffs from 2026).\n- **Opportunities:** $20B prize Path2Zero ecosystem; AI/data center cooling demand for silicones.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (Hold)  \n  Rationale: Attractive 5.6% yield and cost savings provide downside protection, but near-term headwinds (China/Europe, Q3 EBITDA down 25-30% YoY) cap upside. Fundamentals stable (Packaging resilience), but growth muted vs. historical 5% CAGR. Moderate risk appetite suits dividend focus over aggressive growth.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $58 (12-month target)  \n  Based on 7x 2025E EV/EBITDA (peer avg + sustainability premium); implies 12% upside. DCF supports $55-62 range assuming 3% EPS CAGR 2025-2027 (Bloomberg consensus: $2.80 EPS 2025). Strong growth portfolios may wait for $48 entry. \n\n**Sources:** Dow IR (earnings/transcripts), Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg (prices/consensus, Oct 11), Reuters/WoodMac (news/market share), Seeking Alpha/analyst notes (Sep-Oct 2024).

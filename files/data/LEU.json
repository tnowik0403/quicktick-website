(NYSE: LEU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $104.88\n- Market Capitalization: $1.73 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $42.57 - $123.07\n- Avg. Daily Volume (3 months): 565,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCentrus Energy Corp. (LEU) is a leading U.S.-based supplier of nuclear fuel components and services to the global nuclear power industry, with a focus on low-enriched uranium (LEU) and emerging high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, the company operates through two segments: Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and Technical Solutions. The LEU segment involves the sale of separative work units (SWU), natural uranium hexafluoride (UF6), and enriched uranium products to utilities and governments. Technical Solutions provides engineering, manufacturing, and operations services for nuclear facilities. Centrus is uniquely positioned as the only U.S.-owned uranium enrichment company, leveraging American Centrifuge technology for domestic production. Amid a nuclear energy renaissance driven by clean energy demands and geopolitical tensions, Centrus is ramping up HALEU production critical for advanced reactors. The company sources long-term uranium supplies and has secured U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding to de-risk expansion. With a lean cost structure and strategic contracts, Centrus aims to capture share in a market historically dominated by foreign suppliers like Russia (pre-ban).

Global HALEU: <1% (nascent market).\n- **Forecast**: U.S. share to 20-30% by 2030 via DOE domestication; HALEU to 50%+ U.S. share by 2028 (Citi analyst note, Sept 2024). Growth drivers: 16 new U.S. reactors planned by 2030.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric | LEU (Centrus) | CCJ (Cameco, Uranium Mining) | UEC (Uranium Energy) | DNN (Denison Mines) |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Market Cap** | $1.73B | $22.5B | $2.4B | $1.9B |\n| **2024 YTD Return** | +120% | +35% | +10% | +25% |\n| **Core Focus** | Enrichment/HALEU | Mining/Conversion | ISR Mining | Mining/Processing |\n| **U.S. Exposure** | High (sole domestic enricher) | Medium | High | Low |\n| **EV/EBITDA (2025F)** | 8x | 15x | N/A (loss-making) | 12x |\n- Edge: Centrus leads in U.S. policy tailwinds; laggards in scale vs. global giants (Urenco: private, €2B rev).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: DOE (multi-year HALEU offtake); Babcock & Wilcox (centrifuge fab); X-energy (fuel cycle).\n- **M&A**: None recent; acquired American Centrifuge assets from USEC bankruptcy (2014).\n- **Current Clients**: 10+ U.S. utilities (e.g., Entergy, Duke); DOE/NNSA (~30% revenue).\n- **Potential Major Clients**: SMR developers (NuScale, TerraPower); hyperscalers (Microsoft, Google via Oklo/Helion); international (post-Russia ban).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong on domestic supply chain security; low-carbon nuclear enabler.\n- **Management**: CEO Amir Vexler (ex-Urenco) since 2022; insider ownership 2%.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Ukraine war uranium spikes); dilution risk if capex overruns.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 4 Buy ratings (avg. PT $112, per MarketBeat Oct 2024); Seeking Alpha \"Strong Buy\" consensus.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 9/10 (Strong Buy)** – Exceptional growth upside from HALEU monopoly positioning, policy support, and nuclear demand surge outweigh moderate execution risks. Hold for conservative; sell only on HALEU delays.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $165** (58% upside) – Based on 10x 2025E EBITDA ($250M projected on $350M rev, 40% margins), peer multiples, and DCF with 25% CAGR to 2028 (HALEU ramp). Moderate risk portfolio fit: High beta (3.2) but backed by backlog/DOE funding.",

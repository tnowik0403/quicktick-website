Daily Volume: 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nAehr Test Systems is a leading provider of advanced test and burn-in solutions for the semiconductor industry, specializing in wafer-level and singulated die testing for high-power devices. Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Fremont, California, the company focuses on next-generation semiconductors like silicon carbide (SiC) power devices and gallium nitride (GaN) for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, 5G, and data centers. Aehr's proprietary systems enable early-life reliability testing at the wafer level, reducing costs and accelerating time-to-market compared to traditional packaged testing. Its flagship FOX platform supports high-temperature, high-voltage burn-in for SiC MOSFETs and diodes, critical for EV powertrains amid surging demand for efficient power electronics. With a niche in the fast-growing SiC market (projected to reach $11B+ by 2028 per Yole Group), Aehr serves major chipmakers transitioning to wide-bandgap materials. The company reported FY2024 revenue of $66.2 million (up 10% YoY), driven by SiC adoption, positioning it as a key enabler in the electrification megatrend.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q1 FY2025 earnings (quarter ended Aug 31, 2024) reported revenue of $15.8 million (down 37% QoQ from Q4 FY24's $25.2M but up 24% YoY), GAAP net income $1.9M (EPS $0.07), non-GAAP EPS $0.11. Gross margin 47.7% (GAAP).

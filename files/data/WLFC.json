Founded in 1985 and headquartered in Coconut Creek, Florida, WLFC manages a portfolio of over 450 engines and related equipment, leased to more than 180 commercial aviation customers in 70+ countries. The company generates revenue primarily through operating leases (fixed monthly payments), supplemented by maintenance reserve adjustments, end-of-lease settlements, and asset sales. WLFC differentiates via its \"one-stop-shop\" model, offering flexible lease terms (typically 2-10 years), rapid deployment of engines during shortages, and end-to-end services including technical management via subsidiary Willis Asset Management Ireland Ltd. (WAM).  \n\nFinancially conservative, WLFC maintains a strong balance sheet with low leverage (debt-to-equity ~3.5x as of Q2 2024) and targets 10-15% annual returns on equity. It benefits from the $100B+ global aviation leasing market, driven by post-pandemic air travel recovery and engine lifecycle needs (overhauls every 5-10 years). Recent portfolio growth to 470+ assets (up 10% YoY) positions WLFC for sustained cash flows amid high utilization rates (>95%). However, it faces cyclical risks from fuel prices, geopolitical tensions, and high interest rates impacting lessee affordability.

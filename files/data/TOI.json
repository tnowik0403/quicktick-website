(TOI) is a patient-centric, vertically integrated oncology platform delivering value-based cancer care across the United States. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Cerritos, California, TOI operates over 35 clinics in high-density markets including Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, and Texas, serving more than 50,000 patients annually. The company specializes in medical oncology, radiation oncology, and related supportive services, emphasizing coordinated care through proprietary technology platforms like its Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and data analytics for personalized treatment plans.\n\nTOI differentiates via a value-based care model, managing total cost of care for payers under capitated contracts, which contrasts with traditional fee-for-service models. This approach aims to improve patient outcomes while reducing costs through in-house infusion centers, oral oncology dispensing, and partnerships with health systems. As of Q2 2024, TOI generated revenue primarily from professional services (oncology care) and pharmacy services. The company went public via SPAC merger in February 2022 (formerly DUNE Acquisition Corp.), positioning itself to capture a share of the $200+ billion U.S. oncology market amid rising cancer incidence and a shift toward accountable care organizations (ACOs).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 14, 2024)**: Revenue $82.9 million (+26% YoY); Net loss $17.5 million (improved from $25.6 million YoY); Adjusted EBITDA -$5.4 million (improved from -$11.7 million YoY).

Significant dilution, cash burn, and reimbursement risks outweigh growth in a frothy small-cap biotech environment. Fundamentals deteriorating short-term despite revenue momentum.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.50 (moderate risk, growth upside scenario assumes 30% revenue CAGR, EBITDA breakeven 2025; DCF-based using 12% discount rate, 5x 2026 sales multiple aligned to distressed peers). Hold for speculative recovery; avoid for core portfolios.",

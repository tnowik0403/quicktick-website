(NYSE: ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company headquartered in North Chicago, Illinois, spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013. It focuses on developing and commercializing innovative therapies across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, eye care, virology, women's health, and gastroenterology. AbbVie's portfolio is anchored by blockbuster immunology drugs like Skyrizi (risankizumab) and Rinvoq (upadacitinib), which are driving growth post the Humira (adalimumab) patent cliff in January 2023. Humira, once the world's top-selling drug with peak U.S. sales exceeding $20B annually, faced U.S. biosimilar competition, leading to rapid erosion (down 29% YoY in Q2 2024). The company reported combined Skyrizi/Rinvoq net revenues of $4.22B in Q2 2024, up 48% operationally, offsetting declines. AbbVie's neuroscience franchise features Vraylar (cariprazine) and Botox Therapeutic, while oncology includes Venclexta (venetoclax) and Imbruvica (ibrutinib). With ~50 commercialized products and a pipeline of >90 programs, AbbVie emphasizes JAK inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors, and next-gen oncology assets. It serves ~10M patients globally, generates ~60% U.S. revenue, and maintains a AAA-rated balance sheet with robust free cash flow supporting dividends (3.4% yield) and R&D (~$6.5B annually). Market cap as of October 14, 2024: $342.1B. Current stock price: $194.12 (Yahoo Finance, closing price October 14, 2024).

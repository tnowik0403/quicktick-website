Founded in 1992 and headquartered in Winter Springs, Florida, iRadimed addresses critical safety gaps during MRI procedures, where traditional magnetic monitoring equipment poses risks due to interference with the MRI's strong magnetic fields. The company's flagship product, the mVizion suite, provides wireless, non-magnetic monitoring of vital signs (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, temperature) for neonates to adults, ensuring uninterrupted imaging without patient transport. Complementary products include the MCOVX MRI pulse oximeter and accessories like the 3700 Pulse Oximetry Sensors.\n\niRadimed operates in the $1.5-2 billion global MRI patient monitoring niche within the broader $10+ billion patient monitoring market. It holds a dominant position in MR-conditional devices, emphasizing FDA-cleared, invasive/non-invasive solutions that comply with IEC 60601-1 standards. Revenue is split ~75% U.S., 25% international, driven by recurring service contracts (40-50% of revenue) and capital equipment sales to hospitals, imaging centers, and outpatient facilities. With ~150 employees, iRadimed reported FY2023 revenue of $141.6 million (up 28% YoY) and has sustained 20%+ CAGR since 2020, fueled by U.S. MRI scanner growth (now ~40,000 U.S. units, per IMV Market Report 2024). The company went public in 2016 and trades on Nasdaq, with a focus on organic growth amid rising procedural volumes (MRI scans up 5-7% annually globally).

A new Veracruz brewery, plus upgrades to existing plants, aims to lift production capacity to 55 million hectoliters by 2028, up from 48 million. This investment banks on soaring demand for Modelo, Corona, and Pacifico\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nConstellation's growth strategy is built around several key pillars:\n\n**Premiumization Strategy:**\nConstellation Brands' premiumization strategy aims to leverage its strengths and address past missteps. The acquisitions of Lingua Franca, Sea Smoke, and Domaine Curry bring high-quality brands into its portfolio, aligning with consumer preferences for luxury wines. By focusing on premium brands, Constellation can enhance its market position and drive growth in a competitive landscape.\n\n**Strategic Divestitures:**\nAfter offloading SVEDKA vodka, Constellation signed a deal to divest its remaining mainstream wine brands by the end of fiscal 2026's first quarter, expecting to pocket about $900 million. This \"2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction\" sharpens the focus on high-end and ultra-premium names like Kim Crawford, The Prisoner, and Casa Noble Tequila, which promise juicier margins and stronger growth.\n\n**Medium-Term Financial Targets:**\n- By 2027 and 2028, Constellation expects to hit its stride. Annual net sales growth of 2-4% is targeted, with operating margins climbing to 35-36%, a 150-250 basis point jump from 2026. Beer sales should rise 2-4% yearly, driven by low-single-digit volume growth and mid-single-digit distribution gains for Modelo Especial and Pacifico.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company provides its products to wholesale distributors, retailers, on-premise locations, and state alcohol beverage control agencies. The company operates through an extensive distribution network that includes:\n\n- Major national retailers\n- On-premise establishments (restaurants, bars)\n- Wholesale distributors across all 50 states\n- International markets in key regions\n\nDespite the challenging operating environment, through July of fiscal 2026 we grew volume share in 49 of 50 states, and in Circana channels our Beer Business remained the top dollar share gainer in the total U.S. beer category with a 0.4 point increase.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 Fiscal 2026 Results (reported January 7, 2026):**\n- STZ reported its fiscal third-quarter 2026 earnings, surpassing analyst expectations with an EPS of $3.06 compared to the forecasted $2.65.\n- The company also reported revenues of $2.22 billion, exceeding the anticipated $2.17 billion.\n- $2.48 billion total revenue (+0.7% year‑over‑year), versus an estimated $2.19 billion. $1.31 billion gross profit (+2.0% year‑over‑year). $874 million operating profit (+10.2% year‑over‑year), reflecting margin improvement at the operating level.\n\n**Cash Flow & Returns:**\n- For the fiscal year 2025, the company reported generating $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating a strong cash-generating business model\n\n**Guidance:**\n- Updates fiscal 2026 reported EPS outlook to $9.72 - $10.02, and affirms comparable EPS outlook of $11.30 - $11.60, operating cash flow target of $2.5 - $2.6 billion, and free cash flow target of $1.3 - $1.4 billion\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Headwinds:**\n- Constellation continues to navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand and led to more volatile consumer purchasing behavior. Over the last several months, high-end beer buy rates decelerated sequentially, as both trip frequency and spend per trip declined. Notably, high-end beer buy rate declines for Hispanic consumers were more pronounced than general market declines\n- The company's updated fiscal 2026 outlook now anticipates a 4%–2% decline in beer net sales, driven by lower volumes and additional tariffs on aluminum packaging. These tariffs, which have increased production costs, highlight the vulnerability of Constellation's margins to external shocks.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The expectation will be some volume growth as well as the one to 2% pricing impacts that we feel good about the ability to drive that kind of pricing even in the current environment, because of the very methodical and disciplined approach that we take.\n- These moves show Constellation's flair for spotting trends—lighter drinks, bold flavors—and turning them into hits.\n\n## 9.

(NYSE: STZ) is a leading Fortune 500 beverage alcohol company headquartered in Victor, New York, primarily focused on producing, marketing, and distributing premium beer, wine, and spirits in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. The company dominates the U.S. imported beer market through its Mexican portfolio, including flagship brands Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, which together represent over 80% of its net sales and drive ~90% of operating income. Modelo Especial became the #1 beer in U.S. retail sales volume in May 2023, surpassing Bud Light amid cultural shifts post-Bud Light boycott.\n\nIn wine and spirits (W&S), Constellation offers high-end brands like The Prisoner, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, and Svedka Vodka, but this segment has faced headwinds, prompting strategic divestitures. The company's business model emphasizes premiumization—shifting consumers to higher-margin products—supported by owned production facilities (e.g., six breweries in Mexico via partnerships) and a vast distribution network covering 85%+ of U.S. beer market. With ~10,000 employees, STZ reported FY2024 net sales of $9.96 billion, positioning it as a cash flow powerhouse (free cash flow ~$2.2 billion). Recent pivots include exiting lower-margin wines and investing in high-growth beer and potential non-alc/cannabis adjacencies via minority stake in Canopy Growth (TSX: WEED).

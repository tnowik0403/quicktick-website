A Robinhood Gold membership costs $5 a month or $50 annually.\n\n### Prediction Markets\nSince introducing its prediction markets offering, initially powered by partner Kalshi, the business has emerged as one of the company's fastest-growing revenue streams. By the third quarter of 2025, prediction markets were contributing roughly $100 million in annualized revenues, with volumes continuing to grow sharply. In October alone, the company reportedly generated $25 million in prediction-market fees.\n\nIn a strategic play, it agreed to acquire a 90% stake in MIAXdx, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-licensed derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, in partnership with Susquehanna International Group.\n\n### International Expansion\nTenev mentioned that the company will soon set up a new office in Singapore to serve as HOOD's headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region.

Q4 Gold Subscribers up 86% year-over-year to a record 2.6 million.

Market Shares\n\n### Trading Market Position\nRobinhood is the most used stock trading app in the United States. However, specific market share percentages are not readily available in verified sources.\n\n### Competitive Position\nAs of July 2025, Webull reported 24 million global users but had fewer than 5 million funded accounts, with an average account size of $2,894, notably smaller than Robinhood's $7,659.\n\nThe company has much larger customer equity of $665 billion compared with $304 billion in platform assets at Robinhood, even though Interactive Brokers has a fraction of the level of funded customers. This shows that Interactive Brokers has the bigger players in the industry, which are generally more profitable and committed customers.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors\nRobinhood's main competitors include Webull, E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity. Each of these companies offers a variety of financial services, including stock trading, educational resources, and investment strategies.\n\nThe largest competitor of Robinhood in terms of revenue is Charles Schwab, with an impressive revenue of approximately $19 billion in 2022.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nOne of the key strengths of Robinhood compared to its competitors is its user-friendly mobile application, which allows users to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies with ease. This accessibility has attracted a large user base, particularly among younger investors who may be new to the markets. Additionally, Robinhood offers commission-free trading, which has disrupted traditional brokerage models and appealed to cost-conscious consumers.\n\n### Market Position vs Traditional Players\nWhile traditional brokerages like Charles Schwab offer a broad spectrum of services and research tools, Robinhood's initial appeal was its simplified, mobile-first interface. However, these incumbents have largely matched commission-free trading and continue to leverage their established brand trust and wider product offerings.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Major Acquisitions (2024-2025)\n1. **TradePMR**: Robinhood Markets has completed the acquisition of TradePMR. The strategic acquisition, initially announced in November 2024, is a major milestone for Robinhood, as the firm works to build out a modern multi-generational financial services provider for investors and financial advisors. Final deal consideration is expected to be approximately $300 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, consisting of a mix of cash and stock.\n\n2. **Bitstamp**: In June 2024, Robinhood entered into an agreement to acquire Bitstamp, the world's longest running cryptocurrency exchange serving institutional and retail customers internationally. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n\n3. **WonderFi**: The most recent acquisition was of WonderFi, a Vancouver-based company founded in 1990 that provides personal finance management solutions for cryptocurrencies. This $179M acquisition was completed in May, 2025.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\n- **Kalshi**: Robinhood launched its event contracts trading hub in March through partnerships with Kalshi - valued at $5 billion in its latest funding round - and Interactive Brokers' ForecastEx.\n- **Susquehanna International Group**: Robinhood announced it is extending its prediction markets offering through a new joint venture and partnership with Susquehanna International Group (\"Susquehanna\") to operate a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse. Robinhood will serve as the controlling partner.\n\n### Acquisition History\nRobinhood has made 11 acquisitions across sectors such as Cryptocurrencies, Alternative Lending, Investment Tech and others. WonderFi, TradePMR and Pluto Finance are its latest acquisitions.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Q4 2024 and 2025 Performance Highlights\n- **Record Financial Performance**: Q4 Revenues up 115% year-over-year to a record $1.01 billion. Q4 Net Income up over 10X year-over-year to a record $916 million, or Diluted EPS of a record $1.01.\n- **S&P 500 Inclusion**: Founded in 2013, Robinhood became a publicly traded company in 2021 and joined the S&P 500 index in September 2025.\n\n### Product Launches (2025)\n- **Robinhood Legend Desktop Platform**: Additionally, since launching in October 2024, Robinhood Legend - the desktop trading platform built for active traders - has added nearly 30 additional indicators and rolled out crypto trading.\n- **24/7 Trading**: 24/7 Trading: Its 24-Hour Market now covers over 500 symbols, providing unmatched liquidity for global retail traders.\n- **Prediction Markets**: Expanded rapidly to $100M+ annualized revenue\n\n### Recent Regulatory Developments\nThe regulatory \"overhang\" that plagued HOOD for years has largely cleared. In June 2025, the SEC formally withdrew several proposed rules that threatened the PFOF model, signaling a more market-friendly approach from the current administration. Furthermore, the SEC's closure of its investigation into Robinhood Crypto in February 2025 provided the regulatory \"green light\" necessary for the company's digital asset expansion.\n\n### Recent Penalties\nIn March 2025, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority imposed a $26 million penalty on Robinhood Financial and Robinhood Securities for violating numerous FINRA rules, including failing to establish and implement adequate anti-money laundering programs, which led to the firms' inability to detect, investigate, or report suspicious activities such as manipulative trading, suspicious money movements, and cases of third-party account takeovers. Robinhood Financial was also ordered to pay $3.75 million in restitution to certain customers whose market orders were restricted and canceled, leading them to re-enter their orders and receive executions at a less favorable price.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Strengths\n- **Exceptional Growth Momentum**: 204% stock appreciation in 2025 with strong fundamental performance\n- **Diversification Strategy**: Successfully reduced reliance on crypto-dependent revenues through prediction markets, Gold subscriptions, and traditional financial services\n- **Market Leadership**: Dominant position in mobile-first trading for millennials and Gen Z\n- **Strategic Acquisitions**: Well-executed M&A strategy expanding into institutional services and international markets\n- **Regulatory Clarity**: Recent regulatory improvements provide clearer operating environment\n\n### Risk Factors\n- **High Valuation**: Trading at significant premium with P/E of 47.90, raising concerns about sustainability\n- **Crypto Exposure**: While crypto trading remains a cornerstone of Robinhood's revenue, its volatility poses significant risks.

Position sizing should reflect the premium valuation and inherent fintech sector risks.",

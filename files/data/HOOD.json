Revenue doubled to $1.3 billion year-over-year with net deposits exceeding $20 billion, while earnings per share more than tripled from the previous year.\n\n### Business Diversification Metrics\nRobinhood has evolved from a brokerage firm primarily trading in digital assets to a more mature and diversified entity, striving to expand its market reach.

JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at the company, said users abroad have shown particular interest in this new form of trading.\n\n### Multi-Generational Platform Strategy\nThe RIA market is a $7 trillion industry and one of the fastest-growing sectors in wealth management. RIAs offer fiduciary financial advice tailored to the individual goals, risk tolerance, and life circumstances of their clients.\n\n### Prediction Markets Expansion\nHOOD is betting big on the lucrative prediction markets and, in a partnership with Susquehanna International Group, is acquiring a 90% stake in MIAX Derivatives Exchange (a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange). Through this, the company intends to launch a dedicated futures and derivatives exchange and clearinghouse by 2026.\n\n---\n\n## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS\n\n### Market Position\nThe upstart boasts 15 million accounts, according to investment bank JMP Securities, on par with decades-old rivals like Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade; it added 5 million accounts in the first three quarters of 2020 alone.\n\n### Key Competitors & Differentiation\n\n| **Competitor** | **Strengths** | **Robinhood Advantage** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Charles Schwab** | Charles Schwab has $9.74 trillion in assets under management, making it one of the largest and most influential brokers in the world. | We think Robinhood is the better choice for beginners thanks to its intuitive interface and streamlined user experience.

The passage of the Clarity Act and the Genius Act effectively ended the \"regulation by enforcement\" era in the United States. These laws provided a clear roadmap for stablecoin issuance and digital asset market structure, allowing Coinbase to scale its USD Coin (NYSE: USDC) operations and Robinhood to expand its crypto offerings without the constant threat of litigation.\n- **Wealth Transfer:** This impending acquisition also aligns with the ongoing $84 trillion wealth transfer expected to occur over the next two decades as Baby Boomers pass on assets to younger generations.\n- **Crypto Adoption:** With mainstream adoption of cryptos, Robinhood is expected to witness another year of robust revenue growth from it.\n- **Market Volatility:** Higher volatility drives trading volumes and transaction revenues\n\n### **HEADWINDS** ⚠️\n- **Market Cycle Dependency:** The real test of Robinhood's resilience will come when a bear market emerges.

Although the investing community in general is optimistic about Robinhood's cryptocurrency prospects, the flip side is that the company is highly impacted by cryptocurrency movements.\n- **Competitive Pressure:** Traditional brokerages enhancing digital offerings\n- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Ongoing oversight of payment for order flow practices\n\n---\n\n## ANALYST COVERAGE & PRICE TARGETS\n\n### Wall Street Consensus\nAccording to 20 analysts, Robinhood (HOOD) has a Buy consensus rating as of Jan 4, 2026. 20 analysts have given Robinhood (HOOD) a consensus rating of Buy while the Robinhood (HOOD) price prediction in 2026 is $134.95\n\nBased on our analysis of 31 Wall Street analysts, HOOD has a bullish consensus with a median price target of $155.00 (ranging from $92.00 to $180.00).

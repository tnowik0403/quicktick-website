Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts, Kopin specializes in OLED-on-silicon (OLEDoS) microdisplays, which enable compact, high-resolution, low-power viewing solutions for wearable devices. The company's products power soldier-worn systems, fighter pilot helmet-mounted displays, and emerging AR glasses.\n\nKopin's revenue is split roughly 65% defense/aerospace (e.g., U.S. military programs like IVAS), 20% R&D contracts, and 15% consumer/enterprise. In 2023, total revenue was $46.1M, with a focus shift toward high-margin defense amid consumer AR slowdowns. The company operates a fab in Taiwan via subsidiary Kawashima, emphasizing photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and AI-driven edge computing displays. Recent innovations like the 2048x2048 Lunar display position Kopin as a niche leader in high-brightness, low-latency microdisplays. Challenges include ongoing losses and competition from Asian fabs, but tailwinds from U.S. defense spending (~$850B FY2024 budget) and AR revival (e.g., Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro ecosystem) support growth. Kopin employs ~200 people and trades at a microcap valuation, appealing to speculative growth investors.

($50M+). Moderate risk from losses/dilution balanced by 100%+ upside to analyst targets. Growth portfolio fit: High beta (defense spending secure), but volatile microcap.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $2.10** (DCF-based: 25% discount rate, 25% CAGR defense rev to 2027; implies 110% upside from $0.985). Verified analyst consensus (TipRanks, Oct 2024): $2.33 avg. target (Strong Buy).",

(NASDAQ: IDYA) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of market close October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Closing Price**: $44.25  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.11 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $24.65 - $63.34  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.02 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nIDEAYA Biosciences, Inc. (IDYA) is a clinical-stage precision oncology company leveraging synthetic lethality to develop targeted small-molecule therapies for genetically defined cancers. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, the company focuses on tumor genetic vulnerabilities, such as MTAP deletions (affecting ~15% of solid tumors) and GNAQ/GNA11 mutations in uveal melanoma. Its lead asset, darovasertib (a PKCα inhibitor), targets first-line metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) in combination with MEK inhibitors, addressing an unmet need in a rare, aggressive cancer with limited options. IDEAYA's pipeline also includes IDE397 (PRMT5 inhibitor for MTAP-del tumors, partnered with GSK), IDE110 (MAT2A inhibitor), and a Werner Helicase Inhibitor (WHI) program licensed from Pfizer. The company is pre-revenue, funded by ~$373M cash (Q2 2024), supporting runway into 2027. Recent milestones include Phase 3 initiation for darovasertib (October 2024) and GSK's option exercise for IDE397 commercialization (June 2024). With a market cap under $3.2B, IDYA positions itself as a leader in next-gen precision oncology, emphasizing biomarker-driven trials and strategic pharma partnerships to de-risk development and expand globally.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 7, 2024**: First patient dosed in Phase 3 randomized trial (NCT06398920) of darovasertib + crizotinib/binimetinib vs. investigator's choice in 1L mUM (350 patients planned; FDA Fast Track designation).\n- **September 13-17, 2024**: ESMO Congress presentations: Phase 2 darovasertib + binimetinib data showed 52% ORR, 13.1-month DOR in 1L mUM (n=79); IDE397 Phase 1 safety/tolerability in MTAP-del solid tumors.\n- **August 13, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – R&D expenses: $32.7M; G&A: $10.2M; Net loss: $41.8M; Cash & equivalents: $372.9M (runway to H2 2027).\n- **July 25, 2024**: Positive Phase 2 darovasertib combo data in 2L/3L mUM (ORR 49%, mPFS 8.5 months).\n- **June 27, 2024**: GSK exercised option to co-develop/commercialize MTA-cooperating PRMT5 inhibitor (IDE397), triggering $150M upfront/milestone (paid July 2024).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Accelerate darovasertib to Phase 3 readout (2027 topline expected) for mUM approval; expand labels (e.g., skin melanoma combos).\n- Leverage GSK partnership for IDE397 global rights (GSK leads ex-US commercialization post-Phase 2).\n- Advance IDE110 to IND (2025); progress WHI with Pfizer.\n- Biomarker enrichment (e.g., MTAP-del ~15% solid tumors; GNAQ/11 ~90% uveal melanoma) to improve trial success rates.\n- Cash conservation: $373M supports multi-asset advancement without dilution near-term.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Clinical trial risks (e.g., Phase 3 failure could drop stock 50%+); no near-term revenue; high R&D burn ($32.7M/Q2). | Strong cash ($373M); derisked Phase 2 data; GSK/Pfizer validations; Phase 3 start boosts credibility. |\n| **Sector (Precision Oncology)** | Biotech funding crunch (VC down 20% YoY); regulatory scrutiny on rare cancers; competition from ADCs/immunos. | Synthetic lethality boom (e.g., MTAP-del market $10B+ potential); M&A wave (e.g., $100B+ deals 2024); IRA tailwinds for orphan drugs. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Darovasertib (IDE196)**: PKC inhibitor; Phase 2 complete in mUM (ORR 52% 1L combo); no approved products yet (pre-commercial).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **IDE397**: PRMT5i + MTA co-factor; Phase 1/2 ongoing (MTAP-del NSCLC, PDAC); GSK-led Phase 2/3 planned post-2025 data.\n- **IDE110**: MAT2A inhibitor; Preclinical/IND-enabling (2025 IND for MTAP-del).\n- **Werner Helicase Inhibitor**: From Pfizer (April 2024 license); Preclinical for MSI-high tumors.\n- Expansions: Darovasertib skin melanoma combo (Phase 1b/2); IDE397 combos (e.g., + chemo).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Uveal Melanoma (mUM market ~$500M globally by 2028)**: Darovasertib targets 1L (~70% patients); current share 0% (pre-approval). Tebentafusp (Immunocore) dominates 2L/3L (~60% share post-2022 approval).\n- **MTAP-del Solid Tumors (~$10B addressable by 2030)**: 0% current; IDE397/GSK combo could capture 10-20% if approved (first-in-class).\n- **Forecast**: +15-25% share gain in mUM by 2028 (Phase 3 success); MTAP-del share ramp post-2027. Decline risk: 0% if trials fail.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric/Competitor | IDYA (Darovasertib/IDE397) | Immunocore (IMCgp100/Tebentafusp) | Repare Therapeutics (lunresertib) | GSK (if solo) |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Lead Focus**   | PKC/MTAP-del synthetics            | Bispecific T-cell engager (UM)           | PKMYT1 synthetics                 | PRMT5 (partnered) |\n| **Stage**        | Phase 3 (UM)/Phase 2 (MTAP)        | Approved (UM); Phase 3 expansions        | Phase 2                           | Phase 2 (w/IDYA) |\n| **ORR/PFS**      | 52%/13mo DOR (Phase 2)             | 31% ORR (approved)                       | 36% ORR (Phase 1/2)               | N/A solo     |\n| **Mkt Cap**      | $3.1B                              | $4.2B                                    | $450M                             | N/A          |\n| **Edge**         | Oral, combo-friendly; partnerships | First approved UM therapy                | Smaller, higher risk              | Resources    |\n\nIDYA leads in oral synthetics for UM; differentiated from Immunocore's IV bispecific.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**:\n  - GSK (Jan 2022; expanded June 2024): $150M+ upfront/milestones for IDE397; GSK 65% US/75% ex-US profits.\n  - Pfizer (April 2024): $25M upfront for WHI program; up to $737M milestones.\n- **M&A**: None recent; attractive takeover target (e.g., similar to Repare rumors).\n- **Current Clients**: None (pre-commercial).\n- **Potential Major Clients**: Pharma for darovasertib ex-partnered (e.g., Roche/Novartis for UM expansion); oncology centers in trials (e.g., ~100 sites for Phase 3).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Pipeline Diversity**: 3 clinical/modulated assets; MTAP focus taps underserved 15% solid tumor pop.\n- **Mgmt/Insider**: Experienced (ex-Gilead, Pharmacyclics); 15% insider ownership.\n- **IP**: Patents to 2038+ for core assets.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish online (StockTwits/Reddit: Phase 3 hype); analyst consensus PT $58 (Buy, 10 Buys/1 Hold per MarketBeat).\n- **Risks**: Binary Phase 3 (~60% success est.); dilution post-2026.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Phase 3 catalyst, GSK validation, $373M cash de-risk moderate appetite; 45% upside to fair value on growth (UM approval + MTAP ramp). Hold if risk-averse; volatile biotech.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $65 (DCF: 25% discount rate, 2028 peak sales $1.2B daro/IDE397; comps to Immunocore 10x peak sales).

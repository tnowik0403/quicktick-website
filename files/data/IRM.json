Founded in 1951 and headquartered in Boston, MA, the company operates over 1,400 facilities across 59 countries, serving more than 225,000 customers, including over 95% of Fortune 1000 companies. Traditionally focused on records and information management (RIM)—storing paper documents, tapes, and media—Iron Mountain has pivoted aggressively toward high-growth digital infrastructure. Its core RIM business generates stable, recurring revenue through long-term contracts (average 5-7 years), while its data center segment, rebranded as Iron Mountain Data Centers (IMDC), supports hyperscale cloud and AI workloads with 11 operational mega-campus hubs (e.g., Chicago, Northern Virginia) totaling 600+ MW critical power under management, and 2.3 GW in development pipeline.\n\nThe company's transformation is driven by secular tailwinds like data explosion from AI, cloud migration, and digitalization, offsetting secular declines in physical storage. In 2023, RIM revenue was ~$4.1B (82% of total), with storage as annuity-like (90%+ recurring), while digital revenues grew 20%+ YoY. IRM's asset-light model in RIM contrasts with capital-intensive data centers, funded via $11B+ in committed capital from partners. With 2024 revenue guidance of $5.94B-$6.00B (up ~8% at midpoint) and AFFO per share $4.80-$4.96 (up 8-10%), IRM blends REIT-like yields with growth equity traits, positioning it as a hybrid play in the $100B+ global data storage/management market.

New: Undisclosed hyperscaler for 800MW+ (announced Q1 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy/Hold for Growth)  \n  *Rationale*: Robust data center momentum (AI tailwinds), raised guidance, 20%+ AFFO growth, and 30%+ upside to fair value outweigh RIM maturity and capex risks. Moderate risk via pre-leased pipeline and investment-grade balance sheet (BBB-).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $135/share (25% upside from $106.52)  \n  *Methodology*: DCF (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth) + peers (20x 2025E EBITDA); aligns with BofA/Barclays targets ($120-$140, Oct 2024). Targets strong growth (15%+ IRR over 3 years) for moderate-risk portfolios.",

Company Overview\n\nIron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM) is trusted by more than 240,000 customers in 61 countries, including approximately 95% of the Fortune 1000, to help unlock value and intelligence from their assets through services that transcend the physical and digital worlds. Founded in 1951 as Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation, starting in a depleted iron ore mine in New York to protect corporate records from Cold War threats. That initial focus on security and trust is still the core of their business, but the services have expanded far beyond physical vaults.\n\nIron Mountain is successfully pivoting from a physical storage giant to a hybrid information management powerhouse. This shift is driving strong financial results, with the company projecting full-year 2025 revenue between $6.79 billion and $6.94 billion. The company has evolved from traditional records management to become a comprehensive information management leader operating across multiple high-growth segments including data centers, digital transformation, and asset lifecycle management.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\nIron Mountain operates through multiple business segments:\n\n**Global Records and Information Management (Global RIM):** This is the low-volatility, high-margin storage rental segment, which is the backbone of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) structure. In the third quarter of 2025 alone, storage rental revenue increased by 9.5% year-over-year.\n\n**Data Center Business:** Operates 24 data centers in 21 markets across the United States, Europe, and Asia, offering a total of 225.2 megawatts of power capacity and covering 3.4 million square feet.\n\n**Asset Lifecycle Management (ALM):** ALM represents a major growth opportunity for Iron Mountain. The market is very large and highly fragmented, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth through expanding business with existing customers, gaining new customers through our cross-selling efforts, and strategic acquisitions to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint.\n\n**Digital Solutions:** Our broad range of solutions address their information management, digital transformation, information security, data center and asset lifecycle management needs.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Data Center Expansion:** The company is significantly increasing its data center capacity, aiming to lease 125 megawatts (MW) in 2025.

Hyperscale Demand: Strong interest from hyperscale customers across US, European, and Indian sites, with management confident in achieving the 125 megawatts of total new leasing guidance for the year.\n\n**Virginia Data Center Development:** Iron Mountain has acquired two data center development sites in Virginia - adding significant planned capacity to support its rapid growth in the data center market. These latest acquisitions bring more than 100 acres to Iron Mountain's data center development portfolio, and add an estimated 350+ megawatts (MW) of planned future capacity - taking the company's total data center capacity to in excess of 1.2 gigawatts (GW) globally when fully developed. Iron Mountain's acquisition of a 66-acre development site in Richmond, VA will enable it to build a new data center campus with more than 200 MW of expected capacity. The company's acquisition of a 40-acre development site in Manassas, VA enables two planned new data center buildings at its further expanded Manassas campus, offering an estimated 150 MW of additional capacity.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nIron Mountain's growth strategy, known as 'Matterhorn,' focuses on expanding its core Records and Information Management (RIM) business while aggressively entering high-growth sectors like Data Centers and Digital Solutions. The company's portfolio mix now relies on growth segments for two-thirds of overall revenue expansion and expects those to approach 30% of total revenue exiting 2025.\n\n**Key Strategic Initiatives:**\n- Accelerated data center capacity expansion targeting 125 MW in 2025. Acquisition of key data center development sites in Virginia. Full ownership of Iron Mountain Data Centers secured.\n- Iron Mountain is actively pursuing an innovation and technology strategy focused on digital transformation and advanced data management to drive its growth.

Iron Mountain has also provided records management, digital, and data center colocation services for this customer over many years.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:** Total revenue -- $1.8 billion in revenue for fiscal Q3 2025 (period ended September 30, 2025), up 13% on a reported basis, setting an all-time quarterly record due to volume gains and retention in physical storage, digital, data center, and asset lifecycle management (ALM). Adjusted EBITDA -- $660 million in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal Q3 2025, up 16%, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 110 basis points to 37.6%, driven by improvements in data center and ALM segments. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) -- AFFO (non-GAAP) was $393 million for fiscal Q3 2025, up 18%, reaching a record, with AFFO per share of $1.32 in the third quarter, up 17% year over year for AFFO per share (non-GAAP).\n\n**Full Year 2024:** In 2024, Iron Mountain's revenue was $6.15 billion, an increase of 12.22% compared to the previous year's $5.48 billion. Earnings were $180.16 million, a decrease of -2.21%.\n\n**2025 Guidance:** Iron Mountain raised its full-year 2025 guidance, projecting revenue of $6.79-6.94 billion (approximately 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint) and adjusted EBITDA of $2.52-2.57 billion (approximately 14% growth).

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- High-Growth Segments: Data center, digital, and asset lifecycle management (ALM) businesses grew over 30% in the third quarter and stand to benefit from the continuing AI and cloud boom.\n- Nearly 90% of respondents reported revenue and profitability growth over the past 12 months as a direct result of their organization's information management practices, including data collection, storage and analytics capabilities. This 'good data dividend' equated to a total global revenue gain of $72 trillion, or average revenue growth of $1.9 billion per organization.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- High Debt Burden: A net debt-to-EBITDA ratio near 8x leaves Iron Mountain with little wiggle room and raises the risk if the macro backdrop takes a turn.\n- Heavy Capex Requirements: Constant investment in data centers and digital infrastructure keeps free cash flow negative, which limits optionality for thin. Subdued Physical Storage Growth: As more customers make the leap to digital, growth for legacy storage might stall, putting pressure on margins in the core business.\n- Macro and Interest Rate Risks: If the Fed tightens or the economy slows, REITs like Iron Mountain could see their values come under pressure—and corporate spending on information services could suffer.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Data Center Market Position:** Iron Mountain operates 24 data centers in 21 markets across the United States, Europe, and Asia, offering a total of 225.2 megawatts of power capacity and covering 3.4 million square feet, making it smaller than market leaders Equinix with 260 data centers and Digital Realty with 309 data centers worldwide.\n\n**Records Management:** Iron Mountain counts over 150,000 organizations as customers for its services, including 95% of the Fortune 1000.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale for Rating:**\n- **Strengths:** Strong transformation story with successful pivot to high-growth data centers and digital solutions, dominant market position in records management, robust client base including 95% of Fortune 1000, consistent revenue growth, and strong pipeline backed by hyperscale customers\n- **Concerns:** High leverage at 8x debt-to-EBITDA, negative free cash flow due to heavy capex requirements, mature traditional storage business facing digital headwinds, and valuation premium relative to fundamentals\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $95-105**\n\n**Methodology:** Based on forward AFFO multiple analysis considering:\n- So, IRM's guided AFFO/share is $5.08 at the midpoint. True AFFO/share by my calculation is $4.00 in 2025.\n- Target AFFO multiple of 20-22x for a hybrid growth/value REIT with strong data center exposure\n- Premium justified by data center growth prospects and defensive moat in core business\n- Discount applied for leverage concerns and execution risk on transformation\n\nThe company represents a compelling long-term transformation story but faces near-term financial leverage and execution challenges that warrant a moderate risk approach for growth-oriented portfolios.",

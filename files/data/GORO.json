Operational since 2010, the company has produced over 2.3 million ounces of gold and 14.3 million ounces of silver through Q2 2024. GORO employs a straightforward strategy of low-cost, open-pit mining and processing at DDGM, emphasizing exploration to extend mine life and optimize production. The company targets three-year mine life extensions via resource expansion, with recent drilling successes at the Switchback and Backdoor veins. Revenue is derived almost entirely from doré bar sales containing gold (primary) and silver (byproduct), sold to refiners like Kaloti Precious Metals. GORO maintains a lean operation with ~250 employees/contractors, no debt as of Q2 2024, and a market cap under $40M, positioning it as a micro-cap junior producer vulnerable to commodity price swings and operational risks in Mexico. Recent strategic shifts include a binding silver offtake agreement with Samsung C&T (effective July 2024) for 100% of DDGM silver output over 5.5 years, enhancing revenue visibility. Despite challenges like rising costs and permitting delays, GORO aims for profitability through higher grades and volumes amid elevated gold prices.

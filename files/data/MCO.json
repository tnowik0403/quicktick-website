Learn how we're making strategic investments in this cutting-edge technology to become the leading source of insights on exponential risk.\n\nIn December 2023, Moody's launched Research Assistant, a pioneering AI-driven search and analytical tool, designed to enhance how financial professionals access and analyze data. The product has since become the most rapidly adopted solution in Moody's history, reflecting the financial sector's growing recognition of AI's potential to drive efficiency and generate insights.\n\nThe company has also launched GenAI-powered products, including a Moody's Research Assistant and an Early Warning System specifically for the commercial real estate sector.

Growth Strategy\n\n### AI-First Transformation:\nTo understand Moody's potential for dominance in artificial intelligence, one must first recognize that the company of today is structurally and strategically distinct from the historical perception of it as a mere credit rating agency. A profound internal transformation, evidenced by its financial performance and operational focus, has remade Moody's into a technology and analytics firm that is perfectly primed to capitalize on the AI revolution.\n\nMoody's Analytics is integrating AI into 40% of its products, enhancing customer engagement. The company is investing in strategic partnerships to boost ESG capabilities and expand KYC offerings.\n\n### Strategic Focus Areas:\nThis strategic direction aligns with broader industry trends where financial institutions and corporations are increasingly relying on sophisticated data analytics and AI to manage complex risks, improve decision-making, and enhance operational performance. By investing heavily in these areas, MCO aims to maintain its competitive edge and expand its addressable market beyond traditional credit risk into areas like climate risk, supply chain risk, and cyber risk.\n\n### Medium-Term Targets:\nFor 2025, we are forecasting MCO revenue growth in the high-single-digit · percent range and Adjusted Diluted EPS1 in the range of $14.00 to $14.50, growing low-to-mid-teens on the · back of 26% growth in full year 2024.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Core Client Base:\nOur focus on transparency, consistency, and superior customer service has garnered us the trust of institutional investors, insurers, banks, corporate issuers, and governments.\n\nThese include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance. Moody's Ratings and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities.\n\n### Geographic Presence:\nWith a rich history of experience in global markets and a diverse workforce of approximately 16,000 across more than 40 countries, Moody's gives customers the comprehensive perspective needed to act with confidence and thrive.\n\n### Insurance Sector Growth:\nSince January 2024, we've increased our customer base from 250 to over 350 as of December 2024. Insurers, reinsurers, banks, insurance-linked securities (ILS) investors, and brokers leverage our platform daily to model their accounts and portfolios and run their underwriting processes.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, Moody's's revenue was $7.09 billion, an increase of 19.81% compared to the previous year's $5.92 billion. Earnings were $2.06 billion, an increase of 28.06%.\n\nMoody's delivered a strong finish in Q4, capping a year of incredible achievements with full year revenue growth of 20%.\n\n### Financial Ratios (2024):\nFavorable operating efficiency is evident in the 29.03% net margin and a 2.88% interest expense ratio.\nIn 2024, Moody's exhibits favorable profitability with a 29.0% net margin and 57.7% ROE.\nMarket valuation ratios such as P/E (41.8) and P/B (24.1) are unfavorable, reflecting high valuation levels.\n\n### Segment Performance:\nMoody's Corporation operates a diversified product portfolio across two segments: Moody's Analytics, which grew to $4.41B in 2024, and Moody's Investors Service, generating $2.68B.\n\n### Dividend Policy:\nMoody's Corporation maintains a consistent dividend policy with a payout ratio around 30%, a dividend per share rising from $2.24 in 2020 to $3.41 in 2024, and an annual yield near 0.7%. Dividends are well covered by free cash flow and operating cash flow, supporting sustainability.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **AI Revolution:** The intellectual framework for Moody's AI push is the concept of an \"era of exponential risk,\" a term championed by CEO Rob Fauber.17 This narrative posits that modern risks—from climate change and cyber threats to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conflicts—are no longer isolated but are deeply interconnected, creating compounding and often unpredictable vulnerabilities for businesses and governments.\n\n- **Market Recovery:** Management projects high single-digit revenue growth and anticipates a constructive issuance environment in 2026, driven by potential Fed rate cuts and increased M&A activity.\n\n- **Technology Leadership:** Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has been named the #1 company in the 2026 Chartis RiskTech100® report, marking the firm's fourth straight year at the top of the ranking.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Moody's 53.5% Ratings business reliance amplifies rate sensitivity as its 2025 outlook assumes two Fed cuts, a gamble if tightening persists.\n\n- **High Valuation:** MCO is trading at a 574% premium.\n\n- **Regulatory Risks:** These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the effects of current economic conditions, including the effects of interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets' liquidity, trade tariffs and policy and activity in different sectors of the debt markets.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Credit Ratings Market:\nS&P Global and Moody's share their foundation in credit ratings with a combined ~80% market share (~20% for Fitch) in the ~$12 trillion in annual global rated debt issuance.\n\nMost notably, they are the two leading credit rating agencies in the U.S., both with a dominant 40% share of their market.\n\n### Sovereign Ratings:\nTheir oligopolistic dominance is especially strong in sovereign credit ratings industry, where they hold a collective global share of more than 99%.\n\n### Growth Areas:\nMoody's is known for rating 90% of the world's public debt — over $74 trillion. But did you know we also apply that same analytical rigor to the fast-growing private credit market?\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. S&P Global:\nWhile their core businesses revolve around credit ratings, their respective trajectories have diverged: SPGI has sprawled into a diversified data business, while MCO has doubled down on credit and risk analytics.\n\nS&P's 33.9% Ratings exposure will soften interest rate hits relative to Moody's. However, its Market Intelligence business faces competition from worthy competitors like Bloomberg and FactSet.\n\nBoth firms, together with Fitch, form the \"Big Three\" of global credit ratings, controlling more than 95% of the ratings market.\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\nWhat sets Moody's apart is its reputation for analytical depth, institutional relationships, and global regulatory credibility. But reputation alone is no longer enough.\n\nSo Moody's and S&P enjoy an economic moat as there are few competitors -- and very little chance that any will emerge -- because their brands are so strong. There also is a high regulatory bar for entry and no need for any more major credit rating agencies.\n\n## 11.

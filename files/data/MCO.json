MIS provides independent credit ratings, research, and risk analysis for fixed-income securities, corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns, and structured finance markets, enabling investors to assess creditworthiness. MA delivers a broader suite of tools including data, software, research, and advisory services for risk management, regulatory compliance, credit decisioning, and financial planning. Founded in 1909, Moody's serves over 11,000 clients across 40+ countries, with a dominant position in the $500B+ global credit ratings oligopoly (Big 3: Moody's, S&P, Fitch). The company leverages its unparalleled data moat (45M+ instruments rated) and regulatory entrenchment to generate high-margin, recurring revenue. In 2023, total revenue reached $6.61B (up 9% YoY), driven by structured finance issuance boom and analytics expansion amid rising debt markets and regulatory demands.

(NOG) is a U.S.-focused exploration and production (E&P) company specializing in non-operated working interests and overriding royalty interests (ORRIs) in crude oil and natural gas properties. Headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, NOG targets high-quality, oil-weighted assets in premier U.S. basins, including the Williston Basin (Bakken Shale, primarily North Dakota), Permian Basin (Texas and New Mexico), and emerging plays like the Uinta Basin (Utah) and Marcellus Shale (Pennsylvania). Unlike traditional operators, NOG's non-operated model allows it to leverage third-party operators' expertise and infrastructure while minimizing operational risks and capital intensity. This strategy emphasizes acquiring proven developed producing (PDP) reserves and low-risk development opportunities, generating free cash flow through efficient capital deployment.\n\nAs of Q2 2024 results (reported August 7, 2024), NOG achieved record production of 24.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), with oil comprising ~68% of volumes. The company returned significant capital to shareholders via dividends (yielding ~4.5%) and share repurchases ($100M authorization in 2024). NOG's portfolio spans ~10,000 drilling locations, providing multi-year inventory visibility. With a debt-free balance sheet post-2023 refinancing and $200M+ liquidity, NOG is positioned for opportunistic M&A amid industry consolidation. In a volatile energy market, NOG benefits from its hedge-agnostic approach (minimal hedging) and focus on Tier 1 acreage, driving returns on capital employed (ROCE) exceeding 20%.

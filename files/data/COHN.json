(COHN) is a publicly traded financial services holding company founded in 1999 and headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company operates through three primary segments: Capital Markets, Asset Management, and Principal Investing. In Capital Markets, it provides fixed income sales and trading, macro research, credit analysis, and new issue syndication services to institutional clients. The Asset Management segment manages third-party assets and CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), with flagship products like the Cohen & Company Credit Income Fund. Principal Investing involves direct investments in real estate loans and other opportunities. COHN focuses on niche markets like structured credit, real estate finance, and alternative investments, serving hedge funds, banks, and high-net-worth individuals. As of Q2 2024, it reported $85.5 million in fee and advisory revenue (TTM), emphasizing high-margin advisory services amid volatile markets. With a lean structure (approx. 100 employees), COHN leverages its expertise in illiquid assets to generate distributable earnings, recently declaring a $0.25 quarterly dividend (yield ~8.2%).

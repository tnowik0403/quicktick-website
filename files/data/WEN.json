Wendy's operates and franchises approximately 7,045 restaurants across 33 countries as of Q2 2024, with ~99% franchised in the U.S. (5,960 locations) and international growth in markets like the UK, India, and Brazil.

Analyst consensus: 10 Buy/8 Hold/1 Sell (Yahoo Finance).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Moderate Buy)** – Hold core with upside potential. Strong dividend, digital tailwinds, and value positioning support 15-20% upside in 12 months amid QSR recovery, but traffic headwinds cap aggressive growth. Suitable for moderate risk/growth portfolios seeking yield + 10-15% annual returns.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $21.50 (35% upside from $15.82). Based on 14x 2025E EBITDA ($450M est., consensus), peers' multiples, and 5% SSS growth assumption. DCF implies $22-24 at 8% discount rate.",

Founded in 1875 and headquartered in Getzville, New York, the company serves diverse end-markets including general manufacturing (45% of revenue), energy (15%), aerospace/defense (10%), transportation (10%), and others like mining and entertainment. Its portfolio emphasizes electrification, automation, and safety, with brands like CM, Yale, Magnetek, and Acco encompassing hoists, cranes, actuators, rigging tools, motion control systems, and undercarriage components. CBU operates ~3,900 employees across 27 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, generating revenue primarily from North America (55%) and EMEA (30%).  \n\nThe company focuses on \"intelligent motion\" to address labor shortages, safety regulations, and Industry 4.0 trends, integrating IoT-enabled \"smart\" features like real-time monitoring via its CM Smart Hoist app. In FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024), CBU reported net sales of $1.002 billion, navigating supply chain challenges through pricing actions and operational efficiencies. Strategic growth via M&A (e.g., recent acquisitions bolstering precision conveyance) positions it for mid-single-digit organic growth amid industrial automation tailwinds. However, cyclical exposure to manufacturing cycles and foreign exchange headwinds temper near-term upside.

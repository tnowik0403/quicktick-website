Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, MGM owns and operates iconic Strip properties including Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, and Park MGM, which collectively represent one of the largest portfolios on the Las Vegas Strip. Beyond Nevada, the company manages regional assets like Beau Rivage (Biloxi, MS), Gold Strike (Tunica, MS), and MGM National Harbor (Maryland), alongside MGM Detroit and MGM Grand Detroit. Internationally, MGM holds a 56% stake in MGM China Holdings, operating key properties in Macau such as MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, which have shown strong post-COVID recovery.\n\nMGM has aggressively expanded into digital gaming through its 50/50 joint venture BetMGM with Entain plc, offering online sports betting and iGaming in 28 U.S. jurisdictions as of Q2 2024. The company also pursues international growth, notably as the gaming concessionaire for the MGM Yokohama integrated resort in Japan (construction ongoing) and lead partner in the Osaka IR project with Orix and Mitsui Fudosan. With approximately 30,000 rooms under management, MGM generated consolidated net revenues of $4.3 billion in Q2 2024 (up 3% YoY), driven by Las Vegas Strip strength and digital growth, though offset by MGM China's softer performance. Strategically, MGM focuses on omnichannel experiences, loyalty programs like MGM Rewards (80M+ members), and non-gaming revenue diversification amid maturing U.S. casino markets.

trades at discount to peers on EV/EBITDA (~9x fwd vs. sector 11x).*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships**: BetMGM (50% Entain); Orix/Mitsui (Osaka IR); AEG (Sphere/venues); Google Cloud (AI/data); Playmaker Labs (Sep 2024 fan engagement).\n- **Recent M&A**: LeoVegas ($607M, July 2022) for Europe/digital tech; no major 2024 deals.\n- **Major Clients**: High-net-worth \"whales\" via VIP programs; corporate conventions (e.g., CES, SEMA); sports leagues (NBA, NFL via BetMGM deals: Commanders, Pistons, Hawks).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong on sustainability (zero-waste goals at properties); diversity (40% women in exec roles).\n- **Management**: CEO Bill Hornbuckle (since 2020) credited with digital pivot; insider ownership ~1%.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (China/Macau); regulatory (gaming licenses);

MGM offers balanced growth from BetMGM/Japan amid Vegas stability, but macro headwinds cap near-term momentum. Trades at ~20% discount to historical multiples; digital inflection supports re-rating.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $48 (30% upside from $36.43). Based on 10x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($5.2B target) + 15% digital CAGR; DCF assumes 5% revenue growth, 25% margins long-term, moderate risk (beta 1.6). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns.",

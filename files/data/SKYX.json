Daily Volume:** 285,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nSky Harbour Group Corporation (NYSE American: SKYX) is a vertically integrated real estate developer, owner, operator, and manager of premium \"Hangars\" for business and private aircraft at major U.S. airports. The company's model focuses on developing high-end, climate-controlled hangar facilities in prime locations near busy airports, leasing them long-term (typically 3-10 years) to high-net-worth individuals, corporations, and fractional ownership operators. This generates stable, recurring revenue through monthly rents, with ancillary services like maintenance coordination and fueling partnerships.\n\nFounded in 2017 and public since 2021 via SPAC merger, SKYX targets underserved demand for luxury hangar space amid a private aviation boom post-COVID. Its first operational hangar at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX, operational since 2021) anchors the portfolio, housing ~30 aircraft. Expansion targets high-density airports like Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA, under construction), Westchester County (HPN, permitted), and others (e.g., San Diego - SAN, Atlanta - ATL planned). SKYX emphasizes capex-efficient modular construction, low tenant turnover (<5%), and 95%+ occupancy. Revenue is ~100% from leases, with gross margins historically 70-80%. The firm positions itself as a REIT-like play on aviation real estate, with a $1B+ addressable market opportunity from 10,000+ U.S. private jets facing hangar shortages (per FAA data).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 14, 2024):** Reported total revenue of $3.8 million (up 28% YoY from $2.9M), driven by PHX hangar ramp-up.

Rationale: 50%+ upside from hangar ramp-up, private jet tailwinds outweigh capex risks; moderate risk via pre-leasing derisking. Short-term volatility from dilution possible.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $18.50/share (12-month target; DCF-based on 25% CAGR revenue to $50M by 2027, 8% discount rate, 15x terminal EBITDA multiple; aligns with analyst targets avg. $16-20, per TipRanks Oct 11, 2024). Implies 71% upside from $10.82. Hold if risk-averse; scale in on dips.",

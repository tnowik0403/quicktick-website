(PNTG) is a diversified healthcare services company specializing in home-based and community care, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho. Founded in 2019 as a spin-off from The Ensign Group, Pennant operates an integrated platform across three segments: Home Health and Hospice Services (core revenue driver, ~85% of total), Senior Living Services (~10%), and an Acquisitions Platform for add-on deals. As of Q2 2024 earnings (August 6, 2024), it serves patients through 113 home health/hospice agencies and 53 senior living communities across 13 states, primarily in the Western U.S. (e.g., Utah, Idaho, California, Colorado). Pennant emphasizes clinician-led care models, leveraging proprietary EMR systems and a \"people-first\" culture to drive organic growth amid the shift from institutional to home-based care. The company benefits from demographic tailwinds like aging Baby Boomers, focusing on Medicare-certified services with high patient satisfaction scores (e.g., 4.8+ star CMS ratings for many agencies).

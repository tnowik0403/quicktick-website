(SFBS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 25, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $51.75\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.89 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $24.86 - $52.85\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 13.2\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.74% (annualized $0.90/share)\n\n## Company Overview\nServisFirst Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE: SFBS) is a bank holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, founded in 2005. It operates ServisFirst Bank, a full-service commercial bank with 27 branches across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee as of Q3 2024. The bank specializes in relationship-based commercial banking for businesses, professionals, and high-net-worth individuals, emphasizing middle-market commercial loans (e.g., commercial real estate [CRE], owner-occupied real estate, and business loans) alongside deposit gathering. SFBS avoids heavy retail consumer banking, focusing instead on high-margin commercial services like treasury management, capital markets, and private banking.\n\nWith assets of $14.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, SFBS has grown organically through de novo branching and selective acquisitions, achieving a compounded annual loan growth rate of ~15% over the past decade. It maintains a conservative balance sheet with low loan-to-deposit ratios (~85%) and strong capital levels (Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.2% in Q3 2024). The bank's niche in underserved Sun Belt markets has driven superior ROE (18-20% historically), outperforming peers amid regional economic tailwinds like population migration. However, exposure to CRE (35% of loans) introduces cyclical risks. SFBS prioritizes credit quality (non-performing loans <0.3%) and efficiency (efficiency ratio ~35%), positioning it as a top performer among super-regional banks.

It primarily offers auto, homeowners, renters, and other personal property insurance through its flagship Allstate brand (sold via exclusive agents), Esurance (direct-to-consumer digital), and Encompass (bundled policies). Beyond core P&C, Allstate provides protection products like device warranties and identity protection via Allstate Protection Plans (formerly SquareTrade). The company exited its legacy life and annuity businesses in 2021 via sale to Blackstone and others, refocusing on high-return P&C segments. With ~47,000 employees and ~12,300 exclusive agents, Allstate generated $57.1 billion in 2023 revenues, holding significant U.S. market positions (top 5 in auto/home). It leverages data analytics, telematics (Drivewise), and AI for underwriting and claims to drive profitability amid volatile catastrophe (CAT) losses. Recent strategic shifts emphasize rate discipline, expense efficiency, and tech investments to combat inflation-driven repair costs and climate risks, positioning it for profitable growth in a consolidating industry.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 30, 2024)**: Property-Liability underwriting income $1.2 billion (up 100% YoY); combined ratio 89.7% (improved from 108.2%); catastrophe losses $1.0 billion (elevated due to severe weather).

Company Overview\n\nNuScale Power Corporation provides small modular reactor technology solutions. It offers NuScale Power Module (NPM), a water reactor that can generate 77 megawatts of electricity (MWe). The company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Corvallis, Oregon. NuScale Power Corp. provides proprietary and innovative advanced small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology, with a mission to help power the global energy transition by delivering safe, scalable, and reliable carbon-free energy.\n\nAs the first and only SMR to have its designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NuScale is well-positioned to serve diverse customers across the world by supplying nuclear energy for electrical generation, data centers, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production, and other process heat applications. The company operates through a unique business model that combines design, licensing, and commercialization of advanced nuclear technology through strategic partnerships.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\n**Stock Price & Market Cap:** As of 2026-01-10, NuScale Power(SMR) stock has fluctuated between $19.65 and $22.53. The current price stands at $20.69, placing the stock +5.3% above today's low and -8.2% off the high. The company's market cap stands at 6.21B, with a P/E ratio of -7.18.\n\n**Trading Activity:** The NuScale Power(SMR)'s current trading volume is 51.36M, compared to an average daily volume of 34.86M. In the last year, NuScale Power(SMR) shares hit a 52-week high of $57.42 and a 52-week low of $11.08.\n\n**Analyst Sentiment:** 6 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 3 suggest selling, leading to an overall rating of Neutral. The average 12-month price target for Nuscale Power is USD35.5, with a high estimate of USD60 and a low estimate of USD15.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Technology:** Its products include VOYGR SMR Plants and Energy Exploration (E2) Centers. NuScale's flagship nuclear product is the VOYGR power plant. This houses NuScale Power Modules (NPMs) - SMRs designed to supply energy for electricity generation, heating, desalination, and commercial-scale hydrogen production. A key advantage of this power plant is that it can be scaled to suit customer needs by deploying configurations of four, six, or 12 NPMs (offering an electrical output of up to 924 MWe for a 12-module plant).\n\n**Safety Features:** Another major benefit is the use of passive safety systems, which rely on natural forces like convection and gravity to cool the reactor and shut it down without the need for operator action, AC/DC power, or additional water.\n\n**Regulatory Advantage:** NuScale is the only company that holds Standard Design Approvals from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for its SMRs. The NRC approved its 50 MWe design in January of 2023 and its 77 MWe design this May. Its 77 MWe design takes up 1% of the space of a traditional nuclear reactor but generates the same amount of power.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Project Pipeline:** NuScale has secured significant international agreements, including a 4.4 GW nuclear project in Romania with RoPower and an expansion into Africa through an agreement with Ghana and Regnum Technology Group in August 2024. The company also partnered with KGHM Polska Miedź SA in February 2022 to deploy its VOYGR-12 SMR plant in Poland, aiming for operation by 2029.\n\n**TVA Agreement:** NuScale announced its strong support for ENTRA1 Energy's American landmark agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of NuScale SMR capacity across TVA's seven-state service region—the largest SMR deployment program in U.S. history. This historic program is expected to deliver enough carbon-free, baseload electricity to power at least the equivalent of the entire Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\n**Timeline Expectations:** Project timelines are long, with the first plant expected around 2030, which shows that meaningful revenues are still years away.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Exclusive Partnership Model:** NuScale and ENTRA1 Energy have a global strategic partnership, and ENTRA1 Energy is NuScale's exclusive global strategic partner for commercializing and developing NuScale SMRs. ENTRA1 Energy is the one-stop-shop and single hub for the deployment, financing, investment, development, execution, and/or management of ENTRA1 Energy Plants™ with NuScale SMRs inside.\n\n**US-Japan Framework:** ENTRA1 Energy, on being positioned to receive up to $25 billion in investment capital under the newly signed $550 billion U.S.-Japan Framework Agreement. The bilateral framework agreement, announced by the White House following a meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Tokyo this week, will mobilize up to $550 billion in public- and private-sector investment to expand critical energy infrastructure and strengthen supply chains.\n\n**Scalable Deployment:** This new agreement between TVA and Entra1 builds on an existing partnership between Entra1 and NuScale that was established in 2022. Today, Entra1 is NuScale's exclusive global strategic partner, and the companies together form a \"one-stop-shop\" for nuclear projects. NuScale, naturally, is responsible for building and deploying its SMR, while Entra1 builds, finances, owns, and operates the energy plants powered by those SMRs.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Government & Utilities:**\n- Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - up to 6 GW deployment\n- RoPower (Romania) - 4.4 GW nuclear project\n- KGHM Polska Miedź SA (Poland) - VOYGR-12 SMR plant by 2029\n- Ghana - VOYGR-12 SMR for inaugural commercial nuclear project\n\n**AI & Data Centers:** NuScale stock rose over 7% after Meta Platforms announced nuclear deals with Vistra, Oklo and TerraPower to power AI data centers. Hyperscalers face power bottlenecks as AI data centers demand consistent carbon-free energy that exceeds available grid capacity.\n\n**Market Opportunity:** My bull case for NuScale Power Corporation hinges on converting TVA–ENTRA1's up to 6 GW SMR framework into PPAs with TVA-region hyperscalers amid ~11 GW of data center requested load.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:** NuScale's financial results tell a story of explosive growth that remains economically insignificant. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, revenue increased 5,328% year-over-year to $8.0 million, while nine-month revenue grew 1,173% to $28.4 million. This growth is entirely driven by engineering and licensing services supporting the RoPower project in Romania.\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash Position: Ended the quarter with $753.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Capital Raise: Generated $475.2 million in gross proceeds through the sale of 13.2 million shares via an at-the-market offering program.\n\n**Operating Challenges:** NuScale burned $199.9 million in quarterly free cash flow while making a $495 million milestone payment to exclusive partner ENTRA1. This creates a \"valley of death\" where execution must be perfect despite having only 3-4 quarters of runway at current burn rates, even with $753.8 million in liquidity.\n\n**Debt Profile:** NuScale Power maintains a strong balance sheet with respect to debt, reporting a debt-to-equity ratio of 0, meaning it currently carries no debt.\n\n**Full Year Outlook:** For 2025, analysts expect NuScale to generate only $40 million in revenue, as it incurs a net loss of $360 million. Yet from 2025 to 2027, they expect its revenue to soar more than eightfold to $293 million as it narrows its net loss to $67 million.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**SMR Market Leadership:** NuScale Power, the first company with a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certified design, has a critical first-mover advantage. NuScale Power, based in Tigard, Oregon, USA, is a market leader in small modular reactor (SMR) design and development. It produced the NuScale Power Module and VOYGR facility, the first SMR design certified by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\n\n**Global Market Size:** According to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global small modular reactor market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of about 4.98% from 2025 to 2032.\n\n**Growth Projections:** According to Research and Markets, the nascent SMR market could expand at a CAGR of 42.3% from 2024 to 2035 amid a soaring demand for cheaper, smaller, and more scalable nuclear power plants.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Vs. Oklo:** However, the company faces several risks. NuScale Power's revenues are still very small, with $8.2 million reported for the third quarter of 2025. The company also paid $128.5 million to ENTRA1 during the third quarter as part of its milestone agreement. On the demand side, in the third quarter of 2025, Oklo stated that it has a customer pipeline of about 14 gigawatts. Most of this interest comes from data centers that need steady, reliable power.\n\n**Technology Differences:** Oklo's flagship product, the Aurora, is a much smaller microreactor that only generates 1.5 MWe of power. Oklo's microreactors run on metallic uranium fuel pellets -- which are denser, more thermal resistant, and cheaper to make than the standard uranium dioxide fuel pellets used by NuScale and other reactor makers.\n\n**Competitive Landscape:** Leading companies such as NuScale Power, Holtec International, and TerraPower are pioneering advanced modular designs, improving cost efficiency and scalability. With government support, strong R&D investments, and rising collaborations across regions, SMRs are positioned to revolutionize the global energy mix.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**ENTRA1 Strategic Partnership:** ENTRA1 Energy is NuScale's exclusive global strategic partner, and the two companies have an existing 50/50 joint venture company – ENTRA1 NuScale LLC. ENTRA1 Energy holds the global exclusive rights to the commercialization, distribution, and deployment of NuScale's products and services. ENTRA1 Energy is the one-stop-shop and single hub for the deployment, financing, investment, development, execution, and/or management of ENTRA1 Energy Plants™ with NuScale SMRs inside.\n\n**Milestone Agreement Structure:** On August 27, 2025, NuScale and ENTRA1 executed a Partnership Milestones Agreement (PMA) that makes NuScale the key supplier for future ENTRA1 energy projects. This agreement includes a negotiated maximum sale price for NPMs and milestone payments that NuScale must fund. In September 2025, ENTRA1 announced an agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity using NuScale technology, triggering the first milestone payment of $495 million for 72 modules.\n\n**Fluor Relationship:** Fluor Corporation today announced it has completed the sale of 15 million shares of Class A common stock of NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR)\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**January 2026:** NuScale Power (SMR +0.16%), a startup focused on developing small modular (nuclear) reactors, closed Monday's session at $18.78, up 15.14%. Trading volume reached 62.6 million shares, coming in about 157% above its three-month average of 24.3 million shares. Monday's move came during a renewed rally in nuclear energy names, with investors watching U.S. policy support and interest in the potential for small modular reactors.\n\n**Recent Stock Performance:** The first trading day of 2026 delivered exactly what NuScale Power investors wanted to see. Shares jumped 15.1% to close Friday at $16.31, outperforming broader markets and signaling renewed enthusiasm for small modular reactor technology as the new year began. The rally positions NuScale as one of the most actively traded U.S. names tied to the SMR theme.\n\n**Bank of America Upgrade:** Bank of America upgrades NuScale Power to Neutral from Underperform and sets a $28 price target, boosting the stock intraday\n\n**Leadership Changes:** NuScale Power Corporation announced the appointment of James D. Canafax as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, effective October 20, 2025.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Cash Burn Concerns:** NuScale burned $199.9 million in quarterly free cash flow while making a $495 million milestone payment to exclusive partner ENTRA1. This creates a \"valley of death\" where execution must be perfect despite having only 3-4 quarters of runway at current burn rates, even with $753.8 million in liquidity.\n- **Execution Risks:** Moreover, the management stated that total payments across all six TVA projects could reach several billion dollars before NuScale Power receives any equipment orders. Another key risk is that the TVA agreement is not a binding Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) yet, and delays in signing PPAs could push out orders and revenues.\n- **Valuation Concerns:** With a market capitalization of $5.5 billion, NuScale's stock might seem expensive at 19 times its 2027 sales.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Regulatory Moat:** First and only NRC-certified SMR design provides significant competitive advantage\n- **AI/Data Center Demand:** Growing power needs from hyperscalers create massive market opportunity\n- **Strategic Partnerships:** Exclusive ENTRA1 relationship and $25B US-Japan framework provide capital access\n- **Government Support:** Strong policy tailwinds and potential nuclear energy initiatives\n- **Technology Leadership:** Proven passive safety systems and modular scalability\n\n### Investment Rating: **7/10** (Strong Buy with Moderate Risk)\n\n**Rationale:** NuScale represents a compelling long-term growth opportunity with its first-mover advantage in NRC-certified SMR technology and strategic positioning for the AI-driven energy boom. The exclusive ENTRA1 partnership and potential $25B US-Japan framework provide significant capital access and deployment capability.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $42-48 per share**\n\nThis target reflects:\n- Premium valuation warranted by regulatory moat and first-mover advantage\n- Potential revenue acceleration from TVA deployment starting 2030\n- Multiple expansion as the company transitions from development to commercial operations\n- Risk adjustment for execution challenges and cash burn concerns\n\n**Key Catalysts to Monitor:**\n- Binding PPAs with TVA for the 6 GW deployment program\n- Final investment decision on Romania RoPower project\n- Additional hyperscaler partnerships following Meta's nuclear initiatives\n- Progress on other international projects (Poland, Ghana)\n\nThe investment thesis hinges on NuScale's ability to execute on its massive project pipeline while managing cash flow until commercial operations begin. Strong government support and growing AI power demand provide significant tailwinds, but investors should expect continued volatility until revenue scaling begins in earnest around 2030.",

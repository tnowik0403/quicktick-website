Overall: +1-2% share growth annually through 2027 (analyst consensus from Seeking Alpha/Estimize).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | CAKE | Darden (DRI) | Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) | Brinker (EAT) |\n|-----------------------------|-----|--------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Revenue**                | $3.75B | $11.4B      | $4.9B                 | $4.7B        |\n| **Comparable Sales Growth**| +2.1% | +3.5%       | +8.5%                 | +5.2%        |\n| **Restaurant Margins**     | 18.2% | 19.0%       | 20.1%                 | 17.5%        |\n| **EV/EBITDA**              | 8.2x | 12.5x       | 18.0x                 | 9.5x         |\n| **P/E Ratio**              | 12.5x| 17.2x       | 28.5x                 | 14.2x        |\n| **Strengths vs. Peers**    | Diversified brands, low valuation | Scale/ Olive Garden traffic | Steakhouse loyalty | Chili's value turnaround |\n\nCAKE trades at a discount to peers on growth (premium brands lag TXRH's consistency but outperform DRI's casual).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships:** DoorDash/Uber Eats (extended Sept 2024); Sysco as primary distributor; licensing deals with Alshaya Group (Middle East, 10+ locations).\n- **M&A:** Acquired Fox Restaurant Concepts for $360M (Oct 2021) - key to premium pivot. No major 2024 activity; opportunistic buybacks.\n- **Clients/Suppliers:** Major suppliers: Sysco, US Foods.

Rated \"Above Average\" by Institutional Shareholder Services.\n- **ESG:** B- rating (Sustainalytics); sustainability focus on waste reduction (20% cut since 2022).\n- **Sentiment:** Mixed online (Reddit/StockTwits: bullish on premium growth, bearish on legacy traffic). Analyst consensus: Hold (9 Buys, 12 Holds, 2 Sells per MarketBeat, Oct 2024). Recent articles (CNN, Oct 8): \"Undervalued gem amid casual dining recovery.\"\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Steady comps, premium growth, and 8x EV/EBITDA discount justify holding; macro risks cap aggressive buy.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $52 (25% upside from $41.82). Based on 10x FY2025E EBITDA ($500M consensus) + premium brand re-rating. Suits moderate-risk growth portfolios (EPS growth 15% CAGR to 2027 via 5% revenue expansion). Risks: Recession hits dining 10-15%.",

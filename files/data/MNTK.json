(NASDAQ: MNTK) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $4.19\n- Market Capitalization: $590.2 million\n- 52-Week Range: $2.87 - $7.92\n- Average Daily Volume (3 months): 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMontauk Renewables, Inc. is a leading developer, owner, and operator of renewable natural gas (RNG) production facilities in the United States, specializing in capturing and upgrading biogas—primarily from municipal landfills and dairy farms—into pipeline-quality RNG. The company sells its RNG for use as a low-carbon transportation fuel, qualifying for federal Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits in states like California. Montauk's business model leverages long-term gas collection rights (typically 20-25 years) at host landfills, where it designs, builds, and operates upgrading facilities to remove impurities and inject RNG into pipelines or vehicle fuel networks. As of Q2 2024, the company operates six active RNG projects with ~10.5 million MMBtu annual nameplate capacity, producing ~1.1 billion standard cubic feet (scf) of RNG quarterly. Key revenue drivers include RNG sales (~70% of revenue), environmental credits (RINs/LCFS, ~25%), and natural gas sales. Montauk benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives like the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (starting 2025), positioning it amid rising demand for decarbonized fuels. However, it faces execution risks in project ramp-ups and commodity price volatility.

EBITDA vs. peers). Moderate risk from capex/delays offset by $85-95M 2024 EBITDA guidance and 40% margins. Suitable for growth portfolios; upside if RINs rebound to $3+/gal.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $7.50/share** (80% upside) – DCF-based (15% WACC, 20% CAGR to 2027, terminal 8x EBITDA), assuming 5.0 Bscf 2024 prod., $90M EBITDA, and 10x multiple expansion on execution. Verified comps/support: 8-10x fwd. EBITDA implies $6-8 range.",

Daily Volume (3-mo):** 1.82 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nScholar Rock Holding Corporation (SRRK) is a late-stage, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative monoclonal antibody therapies that target latent tissue growth factors, particularly pro- and latent myostatin, to address unmet needs in neuromuscular and cardiometabolic diseases. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the company employs a proprietary platform leveraging novel biologic tools to selectively inhibit latent myostatin signaling, aiming to restore muscle function without the broad off-target effects of earlier inhibitors. Its lead asset, apitegromab, is an investigational therapy designed as an adjunct to standard-of-care treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder affecting motor neuron function and muscle strength. Apitegromab has shown potential to improve motor function in SMA patients already on therapies like Spinraza or Evrysdi. Beyond SMA, Scholar Rock is advancing earlier-stage programs targeting cardiometabolic conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes via myostatin/activin pathway modulation. With no approved products yet, the company is pre-revenue, relying on equity financing and partnerships to fund its pipeline. As of Q2 2024, SRRK had $238.6 million in cash, providing runway into mid-2026. The firm positions itself at the intersection of high-unmet-need orphan diseases and cardiometabolic blockbusters, with a lean team of ~150 employees driving Phase 3 success toward commercialization. (198 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 9, 2024**: Announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 SAPPHIRE trial of apitegromab in SMA patients on Roche's Evrysdi (risdiplam). Met primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score (+1.8 points vs. placebo at Week 52, p=0.0167). Key secondary endpoints also met, including Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) score.\n- **July 10, 2024**: Aligned with FDA on Biologics License Application (BLA) filing plan; submission targeted for H2 2024, with potential Priority Review leading to approval in H1 2025.\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 financials (ended June 30, 2024): R&D expenses $37.1M (up from $27.5M YoY), G&A $10.5M (up from $9.3M), net loss $48.2M or ($0.69) per share. Reiterated cash runway into mid-2026.\n- **September 17, 2024**: Presented full Phase 3 SAPPHIRE data at 2024 Cure SMA Annual Meeting, showing consistent motor function gains across age/subgroup analyses and favorable safety (no new signals).\n- **October 2, 2024**: Hosted KOL event discussing SMA treatment landscape and apitegromab's role as adjunct therapy.\n- Ongoing SAPPHIRE OLE (open-label extension) enrolling; topline motor function data expected Q4 2024.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Focus**: Commercialize apitegromab as first adjunct SMA therapy by 2025, targeting ~15,000 U.S. SMA patients (prevalent cases). Leverage Phase 3 momentum for label expansion (e.g., Spinraza patients via Phase 3 EMBRAZE trial, initiation H2 2024).\n- **Pipeline Expansion**: Advance SRK-181 (TGFβ1 inhibitor) for cancer into Phase 1 combo trials (IND cleared); explore myostatin inhibitors for obesity (preclinical data presented at ObesityWeek 2023).\n- **Funding/Execution**: Extend cash runway via non-dilutive partnerships; prioritize SMA launch with ~$300M peak U.S. sales potential by 2030 (internal estimates).\n- **M&A/BD**: Open to partnerships for ex-U.S. rights or combo therapies; no active M&A but attractive as acquisition target post-approval.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Phase 3 success de-risks apitegromab (p<0.02 primary endpoint); strong cash position ($238.6M); experienced leadership (CEO Doug Cole, ex-Deerfield). | Pre-revenue status with high cash burn ($48.2M Q2 net loss); single-asset reliance (~90% valuation tied to apitegromab). |\n| **Sector (Biotech/Neuromuscular)** | SMA market growth (~$5B global by 2030, CAGR 15%); adjunct therapy demand as ~70% patients plateau on SoC; real-world data supports functional gaps. | Regulatory delays (BLA review ~10-12 mo); competition from gene therapies; biotech funding crunch (XBI down 10% YTD). |\n| **Macro** | Orphan drug incentives (7-yr exclusivity, tax credits); positive biotech M&A (e.g., Biogen deals). | High interest rates pressure cash-heavy biotechs; election-year policy uncertainty. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- None approved/commercialized. Pipeline is 100% clinical-stage.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Apitegromab (SRK-015)**: Phase 3 complete for SMA (adjunct to Evrysdi/Spinraza); BLA H2 2024. Phase 2 TOPAZ (completed 2023) supported dose selection.\n- **SRK-181**: TGFβ1 selective inhibitor; Phase 1 monotherapy/safety data Q1 2025; combos with checkpoint inhibitors for advanced cancer.\n- **Preclinical**: Muscle-targeted activin/myostatin inhibitors for obesity/type 2 diabetes; data updates expected 2025.\n- **Phase 3 EMBRAZE**: Apitegromab + Spinraza initiation H2 2024.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Share**: 0% (pre-commercial) in ~$4.2B global SMA market (2023, Evaluate Pharma).\n- **Forecast**: Post-approval 2025, potential 20-30% share in adjunct segment (~$1B addressable U.S. by 2030) as first-in-class; peak sales $500-800M (consensus analyst estimates, e.g., BofA, Jefferies). Decline risk if EMBRAZE fails (<10% prob.); growth via label expansion.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Company/Therapy | SMA Focus | Stage/Status | Key Diff vs. SRRK | Market Cap (Oct 10, 2024) |\n|-----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Roche (Evrysdi)** | Oral daily SMA Rx (SMN2 splicing) | Approved 2020; $2.5B peak sales | Broad label, but motor plateau; SRRK adjunct | $250B+ |\n| **Biogen/Ionis (Spinraza)** | Intrathecal SMN2 splicing | Approved 2016; declining share | Invasive dosing; SRRK complements | Biogen: $28B |\n| **Novartis (Zolgensma)** | One-time gene therapy | Approved 2019; one-shot curative | High cost ($2.1M), infants only | $230B |\n| **Avidity (del-zota)** | AOC 1042 (myostatin RNA) | Phase 1/2 SMA | Similar MOA, earlier stage | $2.5B |\n| **DYNE (DYNE-101)** | SMA gene-targeted | Phase 1/2 | Force platform, broader neuro | $2.2B |\n\nSRRK differentiates via selective latent myostatin inhibition, preserving muscle safety.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: CBR (Cord Blood Registry) collaboration for SMA sample access (ongoing); no major pharma deals. Exploring ex-U.S. licensing post-BLA.\n- **M&A**: None recent; acquired assets from Takeda (2018 progranulin program, discontinued). Viewed as tuck-in target for Big Pharma SMA portfolios.\n- **Current/Potential Clients**: SMA specialists (~1,000 U.S. KOLs mapped); payers (e.g., CVS, UHC covering 80% lives). Major: Roche/Biogen patients for adjunct (~12,000 U.S.).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Pipeline Depth**: High (3 programs); 80% value in apitegromab.\n- **IP**: Patents to 2039+ for apitegromab.\n- **ESG/Management**: Strong insider ownership (15%); no major controversies.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish post-SAPPHIRE (X/Twitter buzz +25% mentions); 10 analysts: 100% Buy, avg PT $26.50 (StreetAccount).\n\n## Recommendation\n**Buy Rating: 8/10** (Strong Buy for growth upside; hold moderate risk via Phase 3 success/cash runway, but biotech volatility/regulatory risks cap at 8). Targets aggressive growth portfolios.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $28** (DCF-based: $700M peak SMA sales at 25% prob-adjusted NPV, 12x EV/sales multiple on 2030 est.; aligns with consensus $26-30 PT range from Jefferies/BofA, post-BLA catalysts). Upside ~89% from $14.82. Risks: BLA rejection (15% prob.), dilution.",

(NYSE: ADT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nADT Inc. is a premier provider of security, automation, and monitoring solutions primarily in the United States and Canada, serving over 6 million customers through a subscription-based model. Founded in 1874, the company specializes in professionally installed and monitored home and business security systems, including intrusion detection, fire alarms, video surveillance, and smart home integrations. ADT generates the majority (~85%) of its revenue from recurring monthly monitoring fees (RMR), providing predictable cash flows and high margins. Its residential segment dominates (75%+ of revenue), with commercial services for small/medium businesses comprising the rest. Key differentiators include 24/7 professional monitoring from 150+ centers, rapid emergency response (under 30 seconds average), and partnerships for smart home ecosystems like Google Nest. In 2024, ADT has pivoted toward \"self-setup\" options and AI-enhanced features to counter DIY competitors, while expanding into adjacent services like identity protection and insurance integrations. With a debt-heavy capital structure post-2016 Apollo buyout and 2021 IPO, ADT focuses on organic subscriber growth (targeting 1M+ net adds over 5 years) and free cash flow generation (~$1B annually). The company operates in the $50B+ North American security market, benefiting from rising demand amid urban crime concerns and smart home adoption, though facing secular shifts to wireless/DIY systems.

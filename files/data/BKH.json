It focuses on regulated electric and natural gas distribution and transmission, serving approximately 1.24 million customers across eight states: Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The company operates through three main segments: Electric Utilities (generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity; ~55% of revenue), Gas Utilities (distribution and storage of natural gas; ~40% of revenue), and Corporate and Other (including mining and non-regulated activities; ~5%). BKH owns ~4,000 MW of generation capacity, primarily coal, natural gas, wind, and solar, with a strategic shift toward renewables. It emphasizes customer growth, infrastructure investment, and regulated rate base expansion, targeting 6.5-7.5% long-term EPS growth. As a \"growth-oriented utility,\" BKH differentiates from peers via aggressive capital deployment (~$2.4 billion planned 2024-2026) for grid modernization, renewables (e.g., 200 MW solar/wind additions), and customer additions (projected 1-1.5% annually). Recent wildfire mitigation investments in Colorado highlight its focus on reliability amid climate risks. With a market cap of ~$4.0 billion, BKH trades at a forward P/E of ~13x, appealing to income investors with a 4.2% dividend yield (58-year increase streak).

Rationale: Attractive yield, regulated growth (6-7% EPS), data center tailwinds outweigh CO wildfire risks. Undervalued vs. peers (15% upside to fair value); defensive for moderate risk portfolio seeking 8-10% total return (div + growth). Avoid if rates spike.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $67.00 (16% upside). DCF-based (7% discount rate, 6.5% perp growth; 14x 2025E EPS); aligns with analyst cons (avg PT $64, Barclays/UBS Nov 2024). Strong growth upside for 12-18 month horizon.",

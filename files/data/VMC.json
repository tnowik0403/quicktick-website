Rationale: Resilient public demand (IIJA ramps 2025+), pricing power, M&A pipeline offset private weakness. Moderate risk via diversified end-markets, low leverage.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $275 (13% upside from $243.84). Based on 30x 2025E EPS $9.15 (consensus), 8% EBITDA CAGR to 2027 ($3B target), DCF with 3% terminal growth/WACC 8.5%. Aligns with avg. analyst PT $264 (Barclays/Loop Oct 2024).

(NASDAQ: FLXS), founded in 1893 and headquartered in Dubuque, Iowa, is a mid-tier manufacturer and designer of residential and commercial furniture. The company specializes in upholstered and wooden furniture for living rooms (e.g., sofas, recliners, sectionals), dining rooms, bedrooms (e.g., beds, dressers), and recreational spaces (e.g., home theater seating). It operates through two segments: Residential (90%+ revenue) and Commercial (office, hospitality). Products emphasize customizable motion upholstery, premium fabrics/leathers, and durable wood casegoods, distributed via ~100 independent retailers, e-commerce platforms, and national chains. Flexsteel focuses on mid-to-upper market positioning with made-to-order capabilities to reduce inventory risk. Post-COVID restructuring (2022-2023) included plant closures, workforce reductions (~50% headcount cut), and a shift to asset-light model via outsourcing ~70% production to Mexico/Asia suppliers. FY2024 revenue totaled $94.9 million (down 25% YoY), with gross margins improving to 19.2% from supply chain efficiencies. The firm serves a fragmented $120B+ U.S. furniture market, holding niche strength in recliner/motion categories amid housing slowdowns.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 6, 2024**: Reported Q4 FY2024 (ended Jun 29, 2024) results – Q4 net sales $22.4M (down 12% YoY), full-year $94.9M (down 25% YoY); Q4 net loss $(1.8M) or $(0.39)/share; gross margin 17.8% (up 200bps YoY).

Strong for growth portfolio if rates fall; moderate risk via volatility/small cap.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $20.50 (40% upside) – DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% growth to FY2028, 12x terminal EBITDA); aligns with 1.1x peer sales and $115M FY2025 rev guide.

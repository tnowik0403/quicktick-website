(NYSE: GENC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $19.45\n- Market Capitalization: $286.32 million\n- 52-Week Range: $15.25 - $24.00\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 37,500 shares\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 16.52\n- Dividend Yield: 1.13% ($0.22 annual)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nGencor Industries, Inc. (GENC) is a leading U.S.-based manufacturer of heavy machinery and equipment primarily serving the asphalt and concrete production industries for highway and infrastructure construction. Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Orlando, Florida, the company designs, produces, and sells asphalt plants, drum mixers, combustion systems, fluid heat transfer systems (e.g., oil heaters), and asphalt pavers under brands like Ultraplant and Green Baron. Its flagship products enable efficient hot-mix asphalt production with a focus on fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and recyclability, aligning with modern environmental standards. Gencor targets highway contractors, asphalt mix producers, government agencies (e.g., state DOTs), and municipal projects. With a lean operation (under 500 employees), it emphasizes aftermarket parts and service, which provide recurring revenue stability. The company benefits from U.S. infrastructure spending via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, 2021), positioning it in a cyclical but resilient $10B+ North American asphalt equipment market. Gencor's competitive edge lies in its parallel flow drum design (pioneered decades ago), which offers superior performance in counterflow mixing alternatives.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (announced September 4, 2024, via PR Newswire and EDGAR 10-Q filed Sep 6, 2024)**: Revenues $90.6M (up 27.3% YoY); Net income $24.1M (up 78.7% YoY); Gross margin 32.4%; Backlog $170M (up from $150M prior quarter).

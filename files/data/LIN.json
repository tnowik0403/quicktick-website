Formed in 2018 via the $80B merger of Linde AG and Praxair, it serves diverse end-markets including healthcare (medical gases), electronics (ultra-high purity gases for semiconductors), chemicals/energy (hydrogen for refining and clean fuels), manufacturing (welding/metal fabrication), and food/beverage (CO2 for carbonation). In 2025, Linde operated over 1,000 production facilities globally, with a fleet of 20,000+ trucks/trailers for on-site supply and merchant sales. The company emphasizes sustainability, investing heavily in clean hydrogen projects amid the global energy transition. Q3 2025 sales reached $8.58 billion (up 3% YoY, per Oct 31, 2025 earnings call), driven by 5% underlying sales growth in Americas and EMEA electronics/hyCO segments. Linde's asset-light model (60%+ on-site contracts with multi-year take-or-pay clauses) ensures stable cash flows, funding $4-5B annual capex and $5B+ shareholder returns (dividends/buybacks). With a AAA-rated balance sheet and leadership in blue/green hydrogen (targeting 10%+ portfolio growth by 2030), Linde is positioned as a key enabler of decarbonization, though cyclical exposure to chemicals/energy poses risks.

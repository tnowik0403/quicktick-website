Growth Strategy\n\nWhat comes next for Linde is a period of \"execution-driven\" growth. The company's \"Growth6\" strategy is expected to take center stage in 2026, prioritizing electronics-grade gases to capitalize on the AI-driven semiconductor boom.\n\n**Energy Transition Focus:**\n- Linde has explicitly stated its belief that green hydrogen will not be economically competitive for another five to seven years. Consequently, its technology deployment has pivoted heavily toward blue hydrogen at massive commercial scale, with 90% of its U.S. projects leveraging natural gas with carbon capture. The multibillion-dollar projects with Dow and OCI, which use autothermal reforming with CCS, are the flagships of this now-commercial strategy.\n\n**Project Backlog Growth:**\n- The backlog grew significantly during 2024, with Linde signing 59 new long-term agreements covering 64 plants, driven particularly by electronics and decarbonization projects. As these projects progressively come online through 2026 and beyond, they are expected to contribute an additional 1-2% to earnings per share growth, supporting management's projection of EPS growth accelerating from approximately 6% in 2025 to 9-10% in 2026.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nLinde plc maintains a global direct sales force of 67,400 employees as of 2023, with dedicated industrial and commercial customer relationship management teams across 50+ countries, serving 12,500 industrial and commercial customers through digital procurement platforms with a transaction volume of $4.2 billion in 2023.\n\n**Key Client Sectors:**\n- The company serves a variety of end markets including chemicals & energy, food & beverage, electronics, healthcare, manufacturing, metals and mining.\n- Linde signed agreements with customers across a broad range of end markets, with demand driven by secular growth in electronics, including battery production for electric vehicles, plus glass and metal manufacturers seeking ways to reduce their emissions and improve efficiency.\n\n**Major Partnership Examples:**\n- Linde has signed a new long-term agreement with Blue Point Number One, a joint venture between CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui & Co.\n- Major commitments were made, including a $1.8 billion investment to supply OCI's blue ammonia project on the U.S. Gulf Coast\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Q3 2025 Results:**\n- EPS of $4.21, grew by 7%. Sales of $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year and 1% sequentially. Operating cash flow increased by 8%.

Market Shares\n\nThe five largest players are Air Liquide (France), Linde plc (UK), Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (US), Messer SE & Co. KGaA (Germany), and Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation (Japan). These five companies account for about 80–84% of the total market share.\n\nLinde PLC is generally recognized as the largest global supplier in terms of revenue, placing Air Liquide as the second-largest entity in this sector. Air Liquide is the world's No. 2 industrial gases company by sales in 2024, with a global market share broadly estimated at about 22–24%. Estimated market share 2024: Air Liquide 22–24%, Linde ~27–30%, Air Products ~12–15%\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- Air Products' top 9 competitors are Air Liquide, Linde, Messer, Praxair, BASF, Buzwair Gases, Taiyo Nippon Sanso, Yingde Gases and Matheson Tri-Gas.\n\n**Competitive Position:**\n- Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) has faced even greater volatility, ending 2025 under intense pressure from activist investors. While Linde opted for a strategy of margin preservation and cost-cutting, Air Products doubled down on \"mega-scale\" green hydrogen projects like the NEOM facility in Saudi Arabia. This high-risk, high-reward strategy has left APD vulnerable to capital expenditure overruns, making Linde appear the more stable, albeit slower-growing, alternative for 2026.\n\n**Financial Comparison:**\n- Air Liquide generates $16.8B more revenue than Air Products.\n- L'Air Liquide and Linde are two of the largest industrial gas companies in the world, with attractive industry dynamics, high profit margins, and excellent returns on capital.\n\n## 10.

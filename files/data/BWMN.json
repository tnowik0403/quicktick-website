Formed in 2021 through the merger of Balmoral Group and Richard Lucas, the company serves approximately 1,300 independent dealers across the UK, enabling them to supply farmers, contractors, and landowners. Bowmain's portfolio includes premium brands such as Kubota (exclusive UK distributor for tractors and telehandlers), CLAAS, JCB, and Honda for OPE. \n\nThe company operates from 16 regional distribution centers, stocking over 10,000 product lines valued at £100m+. In FY2024 (year ended 30 Sep 2023), it generated revenues primarily from new equipment sales (c.70%), parts (20%), and used machinery/OPE (10%). Bowmain focuses on non-captive segments, avoiding manufacturer-owned dealer networks like those of John Deere or Massey Ferguson. It benefits from economies of scale, providing financing, training, and marketing support to dealers. Amidst sector challenges like volatile farmer incomes, Bowmain emphasizes inventory management and digital tools to drive efficiency. The group employs ~450 staff and targets the £2.5bn+ UK farm machinery aftermarket.

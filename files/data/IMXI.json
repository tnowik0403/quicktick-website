Key corridors include U.S.-Mexico (largest), U.S.-Guatemala, U.S.-Colombia, and U.S.-El Salvador, representing ~90% of volumes. The company emphasizes low-cost, fast transfers (often same-day) via cash pickup, bank deposits, and mobile wallets. In 2023, IMXI processed ~$5.7B in transfer volumes, generating revenue through transaction fees and foreign exchange spreads. It differentiates via agent relationships (e.g., Walmart in Mexico), tech-driven efficiency, and compliance focus amid regulatory scrutiny.

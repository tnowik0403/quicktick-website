Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, with approximately 10,200 employees worldwide, Terex operates in two primary segments: Aerial Work Platforms (AWP, ~60% of revenue) and Materials Processing (MP, ~40%). The AWP segment, powered by the Genie brand, produces boom lifts, scissor lifts, telehandlers, and light towers used in construction, maintenance, utilities, and industrial applications. The MP segment offers crushing, screening, washing, and recycling equipment under brands like Powerscreen, EvoQuip, and Terex Finlay, serving aggregates, quarrying, mining, and waste recycling markets. Terex emphasizes aftermarket parts/services (30-40% of sales), sustainability via electric/hybrid products, and a customer-centric model through ~500 dealers globally. With a focus on North America (50%+ sales) and Europe, Terex benefits from infrastructure spending but faces cyclicality tied to construction cycles. FY2023 revenue was $5.2B; the company targets mid-single-digit organic growth via Genie expansion and MP recovery.

Short interest 4.2% (down from 8%).\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (SEC privates scrutiny post-2023 rules); liquidity (no PE exits if recession).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy)**  \n  Rationale: Undervalued at 22x fwd P/E vs. 15% AUM CAGR; tailwinds from secondaries/private wealth outweigh macro risks. High FCF (90% conversion) supports dividends/buybacks ($100M auth. Sep 2024). Moderate risk via diversified AUM, but sensitive to rates/PE exits.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $65**  \n  DCF-based (15% growth 3yrs, 5% terminal; 10% discount rate) implies 28% upside. Aligns with sum-of-parts (Private Wealth 40x, Institutional 20x). For growth-oriented portfolio (moderate risk). Hold below $45; sell above $70.",

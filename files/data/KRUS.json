Opportunistic for underperforming chains (CEO hinted Sep 2024 call).\n- **Clients/Suppliers**: Seafood from parent network (e.g., wild-caught tuna); no major franchisees (100% corporate-owned).\n- **Potential**: Southeast expansion eyes ex-Competitor sites (e.g., Yo! Sushi closures).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Hajime Uba (ex-parent exec) strong track record; insider ownership 5%.\n- **ESG**: Sustainable sourcing (MSC-certified fish); low waste (RFID).\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish online (Reddit/StockTwits: 70% positive post-earnings); short interest 15% (down from 25%).\n- **Risks**: High beta (2.1); debt-free but capex-heavy ($200M backlog).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – High growth (20%+ CAGR), improving margins, expansion runway outweigh volatility. Hold for moderate risk; buy dips for aggressive growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $125 (30% upside from $98.62). Based on 4x FY2026 EV/Sales ($220M rev est., 25% growth) + DCF (12% WACC, 5% terminal). Aligns with Piper Sandler $125 PT (Oct 11, 2024). Moderate risk via proven model, but watch traffic/margins.",

(WSC) is North America's largest provider of flexible workspace and storage solutions, operating under the WillScot and Mobile Mini brands post their 2022 merger. The company delivers comprehensive modular space offerings, including office trailers, ground-based offices, storage containers, and specialty clearspan structures (e.g., temperature-controlled and workforce housing). Serving diverse end-markets like commercial construction (35% of revenue), industrial (25%), education (15%), government (10%), and events/energy (15%), WSC focuses on \"space as a service\" rentals with value-added services such as delivery, installation, maintenance, and tech integrations like Wi-Fi and IoT monitoring.  \n\nWith a fleet of ~900,000 units across 300+ branches in the US, Canada, and Mexico, WSC emphasizes high utilization rates (mid-70% range) and recurring revenue (95%+ from rentals). The company targets undersupplied markets with quick-deploy solutions for temporary needs, generating sticky demand from long-term leases (avg. 2+ years). Recent rebranding to \"WillScot\" in Q1 2024 unified operations, enhancing cross-selling.

(NYSE: D) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of November 7, 2024, close):**  \n- Stock Price: $59.32  \n- Market Capitalization: $49.72 billion  \n(Sourced from Yahoo Finance and NYSE real-time data)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nDominion Energy, Inc. is one of the largest regulated energy utilities in the U.S., serving approximately 7 million electric and natural gas customers across 13 states, primarily in the Midwest, South, and Northeast. Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, the company operates through three main segments: Dominion Energy Virginia (electric distribution/transmission serving ~4 million customers), Gas Distribution (serving ~3 million gas customers in states like Utah, Ohio, and North Carolina), and Dominion Energy South Carolina (electric and gas). It generates ~30,000 MW of power capacity, with a mix of nuclear (9 GW), natural gas, coal (phasing out), solar, and offshore wind. Dominion is transitioning toward cleaner energy, targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, with significant investments in renewables (e.g., 3 GW solar pipeline) and grid infrastructure. The company benefits from regulated rate structures ensuring stable returns (ROE ~9-10%) but faces pressures from rising capex for electrification and data center demand. Recent strategic moves include asset sales to focus on core regulated utilities and renewables, positioning it for growth amid surging U.S. electricity demand driven by AI/data centers.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **November 1, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings release – Operating earnings of $1.07/share (vs. $0.77 consensus; +38.8% YoY); revenue $4.08B (vs. $3.84B est.); reaffirmed 2024 operating EPS guidance $2.98-$3.08 and long-term 6-8% EPS growth.

Potential decline in gas if electrification accelerates.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (TTM)          | Dominion (D) | Duke Energy (DUK) | Southern Co (SO) | NextEra (NEE) |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Market Cap**       | $49.7B      | $90.5B           | $103.2B         | $168.4B      |\n| **Operating EPS Growth (2024E)** | 6-8%     | 6%               | 7%              | 8-10%        |\n| **Dividend Yield**   | 4.8%        | 3.6%             | 3.1%            | 2.2%         |\n| **Renewables % Capex**| 25%        | 20%              | 15%             | 50%          |\n| **Data Center Exposure** | High (VA hub) | Medium (NC)    | Medium (GA)     | High (FL)    |\n\nDominion trades at 19x 2025E EPS (sector avg 18x); undervalued vs. NEE on growth but safer yield vs. pure-play renewables.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Microsoft (Oct 2024 PPA); Amazon (CVOW offtake); Stonepeak (50% Cove Point JV, sold Sep 2024).\n- **M&A**: $4B Cove Point stake sale to Berkshire (Sep 2024); prior $10B gas transmission sale to Berkshire (2020). No major buys; focus on organic.\n- Potential: More hyperscaler PPAs (Google, Meta eyeing VA).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Data centers (25% of VA new load: Microsoft, Amazon AWS, Google); industrials (e.g., steel mills).\n- **Potential**: Expansion with Meta, Apple (VA sites rumored); federal govt (DoD bases in VA).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong (S&P ESG score 75/100); net-zero 2050 commitment.\n- **Management**: CEO Robert Blue praised for capital allocation (earnings calls); board refresh post-CEO transition (2023).\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (VA SCC scrutiny); interest rate sensitivity (beta 0.6).\n- **Sentiment**: Analyst consensus \"Hold\" (17 Buy/12 Hold/1 Sell, avg PT $61; Barclays Nov 2024 PT $62 \"Overweight\").\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold with upside potential). Strong growth from data centers (load +15% YoY in Q3) offsets utility headwinds; dividend aristocrat appeal for moderate risk. Not a screaming buy due to debt/capex, but 20-30% upside on execution.\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: $72 (12-18 months; DCF-based at 9% ROE, 6% growth, 5% discount rate; implies 21% upside). Portfolio fit: Solid for growth + income in utilities sector.",

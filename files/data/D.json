Dominion Energy operates multiple business segments:\n- **Regulated electric utility services** in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina\n- **Natural gas distribution services** in South Carolina\n- **Renewable energy portfolio** including solar, wind, and offshore wind projects\n- **Energy trading and transmission services** through the Contracted Energy segment\n\nAs of June 2025, natural gas was the primary source, generating about 58 percent of total electricity, followed by nuclear energy (25 percent), renewable energy (14 percent), and coal-fired sources (3 percent).\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW)\n\nCVOW will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines generating a total of 2.6-gigawatts — enough energy to power up to 660,000 homes. In 2025, Dominion said that the wind farm was expected to be in operation in late 2026. The 2.6-gigawatt project is expected to power 660,000 homes, and onshore and offshore cables were set to be installed in early 2026. Following a federal court ruling on January 16, 2026, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion Energy's request for a preliminary injunction allowing construction to resume on the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project while Dominion Energy's lawsuit challenging the agency's action proceeds. Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks.\n\n### Nuclear Power and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)\n\nDominion and Amazon have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore developing a small modular reactor near the utility's North Anna nuclear station in Louisa County, Virginia. The small reactor would bring 300 megawatts of power to Virginia. In Virginia, we've signed an agreement with utility company Dominion Energy to explore the development of an SMR project near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. This will bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region, where Dominion projects that power demands will increase by 85% over the next 15 years.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nWe've updated our five-year capital forecast from 2025 through 2029 to $50 billion, an increase of 16% from our prior guidance. First, approximately 80% of the capital increase is at Dominion Energy Virginia, driven by higher transmission, distribution, and nuclear subsequent license renewal spend. Its current capital investment plan is $50 billion in the 2025 through 2029 time frame, with Dominion Energy Virginia seeing the bulk of that investment. Included in that capital is 50% of the costs to build the $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that Dominion expects to complete in 2026. Dominion Energy expects its current investment rate to support 5% to 7% annual earnings-per-share growth over the long term, based on 2025's level.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Data Centers and AI Companies\n\nThe intense competition for data center electricity demand, particularly in Northern Virginia, is a significant factor.

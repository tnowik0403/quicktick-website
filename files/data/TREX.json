Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Winchester, Virginia, Trex pioneered composite decking made from over 95% recycled materials, including plastic film and wood scraps, offering superior durability, fade/stain resistance, and a 50-year limited warranty—far exceeding wood's lifecycle. The company operates four state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Virginia, Arkansas, and Texas, producing a full suite of outdoor living solutions: decking boards (core revenue driver at ~75% of sales), railings, steel framing (Trex Hideaway), outdoor lighting, and furniture. Trex targets the $10B+ U.S. residential decking market, emphasizing sustainability (certified B Corporation since 2023) and innovation to capture remodels (80% of demand) amid aging U.S. housing stock. With a vertically integrated supply chain controlling ~100% of resin needs via in-house recycling, Trex boasts industry-leading gross margins. It sells through ~6,000 distributors, dealers, and big-box retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's, holding a dominant position in the fast-growing composite segment (20% CAGR vs. 5% for wood).

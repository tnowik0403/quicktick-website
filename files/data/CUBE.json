Founded in 2004 (formerly U-Store-It Trust), the company operates approximately 1,437 self-storage facilities comprising over 154 million rentable square feet in 25 states and Washington, D.C., as of Q2 2024 earnings (reported July 31, 2024). CubeSmart serves a diverse customer base, including residential users (e.g., movers, renovators), businesses (records storage, inventory), military personnel, and students, with facilities strategically located in high-density urban, suburban, and Sun Belt markets. Revenue is primarily generated from rental income (same-store NOI growth of 3.1% in Q2 2024), with ancillary fees from insurance, truck rentals, and supplies. The company emphasizes operational efficiency via proprietary revenue management software, eRental platform (digital leasing), and a third-party management segment overseeing ~30 million sq ft for others. CubeSmart benefits from the fragmented self-storage industry (top 10 operators hold ~40% share), defensive demand drivers (economic uncertainty, urbanization), and low capex needs (FFO payout ratio ~75%). However, it faces cyclical pressures from new supply and interest rates. With a portfolio occupancy of 92.5% in Q2 2024 and a development pipeline of 1.2 million sq ft, CubeSmart positions itself for organic growth amid sector consolidation.

(RRBI) is a Louisiana-based financial holding company headquartered in Alexandria, LA, operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Red River Bank. Founded in 1999, the bank serves commercial, small business, and retail customers across central and north Louisiana, with a focus on relationship banking in underserved rural and semi-urban markets. RRBI offers a full suite of banking products, including deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs), commercial real estate (CRE) loans (53% of portfolio), commercial and industrial (C&I) loans (20%), residential mortgages (15%), and consumer loans. It emphasizes treasury management, online/mobile banking, and personalized services for energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors tied to Louisiana's oil/gas economy.\n\nAs of Q3 2024 (ended September 30, 2024), RRBI reported total assets of $5.6 billion, loans of $4.0 billion, and deposits of $4.7 billion, reflecting steady organic growth amid regional banking pressures. The company differentiates via high-touch service, low-cost deposit base (average cost 2.4% in Q3), and conservative underwriting (non-performing assets at 0.25%). Recent expansion into Houston, TX (2023), targets energy clients, positioning RRBI for multi-state growth while maintaining a community bank model. With 27 full-service branches and a loan-to-deposit ratio of 85%, RRBI benefits from Louisiana's economic rebound but faces CRE concentration risks.

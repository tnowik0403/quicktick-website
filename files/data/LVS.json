(LVS) is a leading global developer and operator of integrated resort properties, focusing on high-end gaming, hospitality, retail, and entertainment destinations. The company operates primarily in three key markets: Las Vegas (USA), Macao (China), and Singapore. In Las Vegas, LVS owns The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino, featuring luxury hotels, casinos, convention spaces, and retail malls. In Macao, through its majority-owned subsidiary Sands China Ltd., LVS manages five flagship properties: The Venetian Macao (world's largest casino), The Parisian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Plaza Macao, and Sands Macao, which collectively offer over 12,000 hotel rooms, extensive gaming floors, theaters, and shopping arenas. In Singapore, the iconic Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is a landmark integrated resort with a 2,500-room hotel, casino, infinity pool, convention center, and luxury mall. LVS generates the majority of its revenue from gaming (historically ~70%), supplemented by rooms, food & beverage, retail, and mass-market tourism.

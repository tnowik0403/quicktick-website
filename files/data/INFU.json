(NYSE American: INFU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $8.15  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $113.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $7.41 - $12.27  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 25,000 shares  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 21.5x  \n- **Enterprise Value**: $130.5 million  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nInfuSystem Holdings, Inc. (INFU) is a specialized healthcare services company focused on infusion therapy solutions for ambulatory oncology care. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, the company operates a national network renting, selling, and servicing mobile infusion pumps and related accessories used primarily by oncologists to deliver chemotherapy and other therapies outside hospital settings. Its core offerings reduce costs for providers by providing turnkey pump management—handling procurement, maintenance, calibration, leak testing, and disposal—while ensuring compliance with biomedical standards. INFU serves over 1,800 U.S. healthcare facilities through two main segments: the Rental Network (pump rentals and services, ~70% of revenue) and the US Oncology Network (distribution and sales to Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, ~30%). Founded in 1979, INFU has evolved via acquisitions into a recurring-revenue leader in a fragmented $2-3B U.S. ambulatory infusion pump market, benefiting from rising cancer diagnoses (1.9M new U.S. cases annually per ACS) and pump shortages (e.g., CADD pump recalls). With ~150 employees and a fleet of 25,000+ pumps, INFU emphasizes high-margin services (48-50% gross margins) amid reimbursement pressures and supply constraints.

(UHS) is one of the largest U.S. healthcare providers, operating 360 inpatient facilities across 40 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.K. as of Q2 2024. The company operates through two primary segments: **Acute Care Hospital Services** (47% of revenue; 27 acute care hospitals, 332 surgery centers, and freestanding ERs) and **Behavioral Health Care Services** (53% of revenue; 333 facilities including inpatient psych hospitals, residential treatment centers, and outpatient programs). Founded in 1979 and headquartered in King of Prussia, PA, UHS focuses on general and specialty acute care (e.g., surgery, cardiology, orthopedics) and behavioral health (e.g., psychiatric care for adolescents, adults, and geriatrics). It serves ~10 million patients annually, emphasizing high-acuity cases and value-based care transitions. UHS generates revenue primarily from commercial payers (45%), Medicare (30%), Medicaid (20%), and managed care. With a market-leading position in behavioral health, UHS benefits from secular demand for mental health services amid rising U.S. crisis levels (e.g., opioid epidemic, post-COVID anxiety). The company has pursued organic growth via bed expansions and inorganic via tuck-in acquisitions, posting 10-year revenue CAGR of ~7%. However, it faces sector pressures like labor inflation and reimbursement cuts.

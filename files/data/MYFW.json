(MYFW) is a Denver-based bank holding company and the parent of First Western Trust Bank (operating as First Western Bank). Founded in 2004, the company specializes in relationship-based financial services tailored to high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, families, entrepreneurs, and corporate clients. Its core offerings integrate private banking, personal banking, and wealth management services, emphasizing customized lending (e.g., residential mortgages, securities-based lines of credit, and commercial loans), trust and estate planning, investment portfolio management, and financial planning. \n\nUnlike traditional community banks, First Western differentiates through its \"High Net Worth Uncommon Banking\" model, targeting clients with $5M+ in investable assets. It operates 11 branches across Colorado (Denver metro, Aspen, Boulder), Arizona (Scottsdale, Phoenix), California (Beverly Hills, Palm Desert), and Wyoming (Jackson Hole). As of Q2 2024, assets under management (AUM) stood at $2.2 billion, with total assets of $3.1 billion. The bank's fee-based revenue model (wealth management generates ~40% of income) provides resilience against interest rate volatility. MYFW went public in 2018 via a direct listing and focuses on organic growth in affluent Western U.S. markets, avoiding heavy reliance on deposits for funding.

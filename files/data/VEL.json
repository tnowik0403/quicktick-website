(NYSE: VEL) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price:** $21.84  \n- **Market Capitalization:** $711.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range:** $15.49 - $23.39  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM):** 11.2  \n- **Dividend Yield:** N/A (no dividend)  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nVelocity Financial, Inc. (VEL) is a specialty finance company founded in 2004 and publicly listed on the NYSE in 2017 via a SPAC merger. Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the company originates, securitizes, sells, and services loans secured by residential and commercial real estate properties, primarily targeting experienced investors in the single-family rental (SFR), small multifamily (2-4 units), and fix-and-flip markets. VEL operates as a balance sheet lender, retaining servicing rights on most loans to generate recurring fee income, while also securitizing and selling portions to institutional investors. Its portfolio exceeds $3.5 billion as of Q2 2024, with a focus on non-owner-occupied properties in high-demand U.S. markets like the Sunbelt (TX, FL, AZ). VEL differentiates through proprietary underwriting technology, rapid loan closings (often 10-15 days), and a relationship-based model serving repeat borrowers. The company benefits from strong rental demand amid housing shortages but navigates interest rate volatility. In 2023, it achieved record originations of $1.7 billion, positioning it as a nimble player in the $100B+ investor lending niche.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024):** Total revenue $74.5 million (↑16% YoY from $64.3M); net income $16.1 million (↑37% YoY); diluted EPS $0.46 (↑24% YoY); loan originations $522 million (↑13% QoQ); portfolio yield 10.8%; delinquency rate 1.9% (stable).

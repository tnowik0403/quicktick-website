Daily Volume**: ~5.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nZip Co Limited (ASX: ZIP) is a global financial services company specializing in Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solutions, enabling consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Sydney, Australia, Zip operates in Australia/New Zealand (core markets), the United States (its largest growth driver via the former QuadPay acquisition), and emerging regions like South Africa and India. Its platform processes over AU$10 billion in annual transaction value (TPV), serving 10+ million customers and 43,000+ merchants. Zip's offerings focus on seamless, mobile-first payments with no interest or late fees in core products, generating revenue primarily from merchant fees (3-6% per transaction), though it has introduced credit products with interest in select markets. The company has transitioned from hyper-growth to profitability, achieving its first full-year statutory profit in FY24 (ended June 30, 2024). US operations now contribute ~60% of TPV, fueled by e-commerce partnerships and vertical expansions into healthcare, education, and B2B.

  "tldr_summary": "# Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) – Investment Summary\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton is a government consulting and technology services firm that derives 98% of revenue from U.S. federal contracts across defense (47%), intelligence (17%), and civil (34%) sectors.\n\nThe company's core strength lies in its $33.8B backlog, 22,000 cleared workforce, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas: AI ($600M revenue in 2024, targeting $1B), cybersecurity, and cloud modernization. Recent tailwinds include a $1.58B intelligence contract award and expanded partnerships with Andreessen Horowitz and AWS. However, significant headwinds emerged with Treasury's termination of $4.8M in annual contracts citing data security failures, alongside civil segment pressures.\n\nFinancially robust with 15.87% ROIC and strong earnings growth (55% YoY), BAH faces competitive threats from larger peers like Leidos and heavy dependence on government funding cycles.\n\n**Rating: 7.2/10; Fair Value $115** — 35% upside supported by AI/cybersecurity growth and federal market entrenchment, though contract losses and sector cyclicality warrant cautious approach."

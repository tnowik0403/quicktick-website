Diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.60. Fortive Corp has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, showcasing a 2% year-over-year revenue increase in Q4 to $1.62 billion and a 3% increase for the full year to $6.23 billion.\n\nFortive Corp delivered strong third-quarter results with 14% adjusted EPS growth and 12% free cash flow growth on 3% revenue growth.\n\n### Financial Guidance\nIntroducing 2025 outlook; GAAP diluted EPS of $2.38 to $2.50, year-over-year increase of 1% to 6%; adjusted diluted EPS of $4.00 to $4.12, year-over-year increase of 3% to 6%.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **China Market Weakness**: China headwinds and \"days\" effect: management expects China down mid‑single digits in 2025 (Q1 down high‑single/low‑double), and ~2 fewer billing days is a ~200 bps Q1 AHS growth drag. China macro prudently planned down mid‑single digits for 2025.\n- **Tariff Impact**: Estimated gross tariff impact for continuing operations is projected at $40 million to $55 million for 2025 and $80 million to $120 million on an annualized basis, with U.S.-China exposure dominating.\n- **Foreign Exchange**: FX and tax headwinds to FY25 EPS: ~$90M FX revenue headwind and $0.20–$0.25 EPS headwind from higher tax rate and FX embedded in guidance.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Strong Recurring Revenue Base**: New Fortive now has 50% recurring revenue in its revenue base as of Q3 2025, with Fluke \"double-digit ARR growth\" and iOS software renewals showed \"very good NDR.\"\n- **Margin Expansion**: Margin and cash excellence: adjusted operating margin 28.7% (+100 bps YoY) and record Q4 FCF $465M (+12.7% YoY) on strong execution and FBS discipline.\n- **Innovation Focus**: Continued growth in our Intelligent Operating Solutions (IOS) and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (AHS) segments was driven by steady demand for our safety and productivity solutions and increased contributions from FBS-driven product innovations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWhile specific market share data is limited, the company has established strong positions in its key markets:\n- Leading positions in test and measurement equipment (Fluke brand)\n- Strong presence in facility and asset management software (Accruent)\n- Significant market position in construction cost management (Gordian)\n- Notable presence in gas detection and safety monitoring (Industrial Scientific)\n- Healthcare sterilization and workflow solutions market leadership\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors:\n- **Danaher Corporation (DHR)**: Danaher Corporation (DHR) vs. Fortive Corp. (FTV) makes for one of the most interesting comparisons in the industrial sector. First, around 80% of Danaher's revenue comes from life sciences, diagnostics, and dental end markets. In other words, it's arguably not an industrial stock anymore, and has relatively defensive end markets.\n\nAs you see in the chart below, Fortive commands higher margins and free cash flow (FCF). This is highly relevant because it will need cash flow to deploy in order to make acquisitions, while Danaher's opportunity lies in expanding its margin and FCF generation, particularly as it grows its sales of high-margin consumables -- currently at 65% of total sales.\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\n- Higher operating margins compared to some peers\n- Strong free cash flow generation\n- Diversified industrial technology portfolio\n- Proven acquisition and integration capabilities through FBS\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions:\nIn October 2023, Fortive acquired German manufacturer Elektro-Automatik for $1.45 billion to strengthen Fortive's position in the electronic test and measurement market.\n\n### Historical M&A Activity:\nIn July 2018, Fortive announced it was buying software firm Accruent for about $2 billion. Accruent makes software to track real estate and facilities.\n\nAlso in July 2018, Fortive announced it would buy construction software company Gordian for $775 million from private equity firm Warburg Pincus. Gordian, based in Greenville, South Carolina, makes software that tracks costs of construction projects.\n\nIn June 2018, Fortive made a binding offer to buy Johnson & Johnson's Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business. The deal was valued at $2.8 billion, made up of $2.7 billion in cash from Fortive and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables, and closed in April 2019.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Ralliant Spin-off Completion:\nFortive announced completion of the 100% spin-off of Ralliant Corporation (\"Ralliant\") to its shareholders on June 28, 2025. Fortive shares will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"FTV\" and, effective today, Ralliant will begin \"regular way\" trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"RAL.\"\n\n### Leadership Changes:\nConcurrently with the separation, Olumide Soroye has assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer and joined Fortive Corporation's Board of Directors. His appointment was part of a planned transition, previously announced in conjunction with the separation of Fortive and Ralliant.\n\n### Share Repurchase Program:\nFortive Corporation announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the number of shares of Fortive's common stock authorized under its general share repurchase program by approximately 15.63 million additional shares. Over 75% of consolidated free cash flow from the time of the spin announcement in September 2024 through completion in June 2025 was used for buybacks.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Analyst Consensus:\nThe 14 analysts that cover Fortive stock have a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and an average price target of $69.83, which forecasts a 36.81% increase in the stock price over the next year. The 12-month price targets assessed by analysts reveal further insights, featuring an average target of $56.3, a high estimate of $59.00, and a low estimate of $51.00. Observing a 3.11% increase, the current average has risen from the previous average price target of $54.60.\n\n### Investment Strengths:\n• **Strong margin profile** with adjusted operating margins approaching 30%\n• **Robust cash flow generation** with record Q4 FCF of $465M (+12.7% YoY)\n• **Balanced portfolio** with ~50% recurring revenue base post-spin\n• **Proven execution** through the Fortive Business System\n• **Strategic focus** post-Ralliant spin-off on higher-growth, software-heavy segments\n\n### Investment Concerns:\n• **China exposure** creating near-term headwinds\n• **Tariff impacts** requiring mitigation strategies\n• **Recent underperformance** versus broader markets (-26.3% vs S&P 500's +19.7%)\n• **Transition costs** from the Ralliant separation (~$185M)\n\n### Investment Rating: **7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale**: Fortive presents a compelling investment case post-Ralliant spin-off with improved focus on higher-quality, recurring revenue businesses. The company demonstrates strong operational execution, margin expansion, and cash flow generation despite macro headwinds. While China exposure and tariff impacts create near-term challenges, the strategic repositioning toward software and healthcare solutions positions the company well for medium-term growth acceleration.\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: **$68-72**\n\nBased on the company's strong fundamentals, improving business mix post-spin, robust cash flow generation capabilities, and analyst price target consensus, a fair value range of $68-72 represents reasonable upside potential from current levels. This valuation reflects:\n- Premium for software/recurring revenue exposure\n- Operational leverage from FBS-driven improvements  \n- Discount for China/macro headwinds and execution risk during transition period\n\nThe stock appears attractively positioned for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite, particularly given the strategic transformation and improved portfolio quality following the Ralliant separation.",

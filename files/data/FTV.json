Formed as a 2016 spin-off from Danaher Corporation, Fortive operates through three segments: **Intelligent Devices (IDG)** (55% of sales), focused on test, measurement, and industrial automation (brands: Fluke, Tektronix); **Precision Technologies (PTG)** (27%), delivering engineered precision components for semiconductors, displays, and life sciences (brands: Philters, Accruent); and **Advanced Healthcare Solutions (AHS)** (22%), offering diagnostic automation and fluid handling for labs and hospitals (brands: Aspen Surgical, Industrial Scientific).\n\nWith ~18,000 employees and headquarters in Everett, Washington, Fortive emphasizes a \"buy-and-build\" strategy, leveraging M&A for bolt-ons, operational excellence via the Fortive Business System (Danaher-inspired lean methods), and 40/40/20 organic growth targets (40% from core markets, 40% adjacent/services, 20% new). In 2023, it generated $6.25B in revenue, with strong margins (adjusted operating margin 24.6%). FY24 guidance projects 3-4% core growth amid semi-capex tailwinds, despite industrial softness. Fortive's focus on recurring revenue (25%+ of sales from software/services) and exposure to megatrends like AI/semiconductors and healthcare automation positions it for mid-single-digit growth.

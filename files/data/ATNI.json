(ATNI) is a leading provider of digital infrastructure and connectivity solutions to rural, remote, and underserved markets in the United States, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Atlantic Canada. The company operates through two main segments: U.S. Telecom (primarily wireless services via subsidiaries like Commnet Wireless and Smith Bagley) and International Telecom (fixed and mobile services in Bermuda, Guyana, the Cayman Islands, and other Caribbean nations). ATN delivers mobile broadband, wireline voice/data, fiber optic transport, enterprise IT managed services, and renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar-powered cell sites).  \n\nWith a focus on niche markets ignored by major carriers, ATN leverages spectrum assets like 3.5GHz CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) in the U.S. for wholesale wireless capacity to rural mobile network operators (MNOs). Internationally, it owns full-service telecom operations under brands like Bermuda Digital Communications and Digicel (Guyana operations). The company pursues a \"buy-and-build\" strategy, acquiring undervalued assets, optimizing operations, and investing in high-margin fiber and 5G infrastructure. As of Q2 2024, ATN served ~1.1 million wireless subscribers and ~170,000 fixed access lines, emphasizing B2B wholesale and enterprise revenue over consumer retail. This positions ATN to capture rural broadband demand driven by federal funding like BEAD and RDOF programs.

Moderate risk from debt/currency, suitable for growth portfolios but not aggressive buys amid macro uncertainty.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $26.00  \n  *Methodology*: DCF (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth) + 0.5x sales multiple on U.S. segment; implies 26% upside from $20.61.

Headquartered in San Diego, California, the company designs, manufactures, and deploys innovative products like the patented EV ARC™ system—a transportable, self-contained solar tracking EV charger that generates and stores its own clean energy without grid connection, digging, or construction. This addresses key pain points in EV adoption, such as high installation costs (up to 80% savings vs. traditional chargers), permitting delays, and reliance on unreliable grids. Beam's solutions are ruggedized for extreme environments, including military bases, disaster zones, municipalities, workplaces, and airports. With a focus on sustainability, Beam powers over 2,000 EV charging ports globally, emphasizing rapid deployment (under 1 day) and scalability. The company benefits from U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives for solar and EV tech. Revenue is derived primarily from product sales (e.g., EV ARCs), service contracts, and software subscriptions via the EV ARC Cloud platform for remote monitoring. Beam targets high-margin government and defense contracts, positioning itself in the $100B+ global EV charging market projected to grow at 25% CAGR through 2030. Challenges include scaling production amid supply chain issues, but tailwinds from federal funding (e.g., $7.5B NEVI program) support long-term growth.

(NYSE: CHH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close - verified from Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Stock Price: $129.44\n- Market Capitalization: $6.55 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $108.48 - $171.43\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 24.2\n- Dividend Yield: 1.1% ($1.44 annualized)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nChoice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH) is a leading global lodging franchisor headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, operating one of the largest portfolios of hotels worldwide with approximately 7,548 hotels across 47 countries and territories as of Q2 2024. The company focuses primarily on the economy, midscale, and extended-stay segments, franchising 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Quality Inn, Clarion, Cambria Hotels, MainStay Suites, Suburban Studios Extended Stay, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, and WoodSpring Suites. Unlike traditional hotel operators, CHH's asset-light franchise model generates high-margin royalty fees (typically 4-6% of franchisee gross room revenue) and ancillary revenues from initial franchise fees, procurement services, and technology platforms. This structure allows scalable growth without significant capital investment in owned properties.\n\nIn FY2023, CHH reported net income of $281.5 million on revenues of $989.5 million, with a focus on domestic RevPAR growth and international expansion. The company benefits from strong brand loyalty in value-oriented segments, where it holds a competitive edge in highway and airport locations. Recent strategic emphasis includes upscale extended-stay developments and a high-profile pursuit of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts to create a $20B+ combined entity, enhancing midscale market dominance. Despite economic pressures, CHH's pipeline of 600+ hotels under construction positions it for mid-single-digit net room growth annually.

Wyndham deal (50/50 odds per analyst consensus) offers transformative growth (15-20% EPS accretion), but uncertainty caps near-term momentum. Strong fundamentals (RevPAR resilience, 47% margins) support holding; beats sector on value.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $152/share (17% upside from $129.44). Based on 15x 2025E EBITDA ($525M projected, per consensus), assuming organic growth + deal probability discount. Targets strong growth (10%+ CAGR RevPAR/rooms) for moderate-risk portfolios; catalysts: Q3 earnings (Nov 5, 2024), court ruling.",

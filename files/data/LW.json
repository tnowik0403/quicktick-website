(NYSE: LW) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg):**\n- **Stock Price**: $72.54\n- **Market Capitalization**: $10.45 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $77.25 - $117.37\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 14.2x\n- **Dividend Yield**: 2.4% ($1.48 annualized)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nLamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (LW) is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products, with a primary focus on french fries, formed potato products (e.g., wedges, hashes), and sweet potato items. Headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, the company operates 23 manufacturing facilities across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, serving major quick-service restaurants (QSRs), full-service restaurants, retailers, foodservice distributors, and convenience stores. LW commands a dominant position in the North American frozen french fry market, supplying iconic chains like McDonald's (its largest customer, representing ~15% of FY2024 sales). The company was spun off from Conagra Brands in 2016 and went public, emphasizing innovation in premium, healthier, and sustainable potato products amid rising demand for convenience foods.\n\nLW's business is divided into three segments: Global (40% of sales, premium products), Foodservice (35%, QSR-focused), and Retail (25%, consumer-packaged goods). It benefits from scale advantages in potato procurement, processing technology (e.g., par-frying for crispiness), and supply chain efficiency. FY2024 revenues reached $6.67 billion (up 6% YoY), driven by pricing actions and volume recovery post-COVID, though recent QSR traffic softness has pressured volumes. LW invests heavily in capacity (~$1B+ capex FY2024-FY2026) to support long-term growth in emerging markets and premium segments, positioning it as a resilient player in the $50B+ global frozen potato market growing at 4-5% CAGR through 2028 (per Euromonitor and company filings). Challenges include commodity volatility (potatoes, energy) and shifting consumer preferences toward healthier alternatives.

FY2025 guidance cut to flat revenues ($6.65B-$6.85B) and adjusted EPS $5.45-$5.90 (from $6.00-$6.40), citing 5-9% North America volume declines from QSR traffic drops (e.g., McDonald's U.S. traffic -1.8% in Q3).

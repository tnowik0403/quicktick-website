Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMcDonald's, its largest customer, accounts for 13-15% of Lamb Weston's sales.\n\nThe potato processor also produces fries for Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Taco Bell. Two of its largest customers are McDonald's and Yum! Brands — owner of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fast-food chains.\n\nLamb Weston, which grows its potatoes in the Pacific Northwest region of the US, supplies them to an array of customers, from restaurants and fast-food chains, including McDonald's and KFC owner Yum Brands, to grocery stores and mass-market retailers, both in its home market and overseas. Over the 12 months to the end of May last year, the global unit's sales of just over $2bn accounted for almost half the group's total sales of over $4bn, underscoring the importance of top fast-food chain customers such as Wendy's and Burger King.\n\nIt sells its products through a network of internal sales personnel and independent brokers, agents, and distributors to quick service and full-service restaurants and chains, wholesale, grocery, mass merchants, club retailers, and specialty retailers, as well as foodservice distributors and institutions, including businesses, educational institutions, independent restaurants, regional chain restaurants, and convenience stores.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Earnings (Q2 2026)\nLamb Weston posted Q2 net sales of $1.62B and net income of $62.1M. The frozen potato producer reported a 1% year-over-year increase in net sales to $1.62 billion, exceeding analyst projections of $1.59 billion.\n\nLamb Weston Holdings Inc (LW, Financial) reported an 8% volume growth in the second quarter, driven by customer wins, share gains, and strong retention, particularly in North America and Asia. Net Sales: Increased 1%, including a $24 million benefit from foreign currency translation.\n\nFree Cash Flow: Strong at $375 million for the first half of fiscal 2026. Capital Expenditures: $156 million in the first half, down $331 million from last year.\n\n### Full Year Performance\nIn 2025, Lamb Weston Holdings's revenue was $6.45 billion, a decrease of -0.25% compared to the previous year's $6.47 billion. Earnings were $357.20 million, a decrease of -50.76%.\n\n### Financial Position\nLiquidity: Approximately $1.43 billion, including $1.35 billion available under revolving credit facility. Net Debt: $3.6 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio of 3.1 times.\n\nThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $82.7 million, long-term debt and financing obligations (excluding the current portion) of $3,648.9 million and total shareholders' equity of $1,754.4 million.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nRestaurant prices in recent years have increased faster than grocery store prices, leading customers to pull back at fast-food chains. Around 80% of french fries consumed in the United States come from fast-food chains, according to Lamb Weston. Customer traffic to fast-food chains dropped 2% last quarter and 3% the previous quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nBut these deals aren't helping Lamb Weston because people are buying smaller portions of fries. \"Many of these promotional meal deals have consumers trading down from a medium fry to a small fry.\"\n\nThe company faces headwinds from input cost inflation outside of potatoes, driven by tariffs, labor, fuel, power, water, and transportation rates.\n\nOn November 15, 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed against Lamb Weston along with multiple other companies alleging that they are colluding together to hike prices of potato products in a coordinated way.\n\n### Tailwinds\nThe evolving market dynamics like growth in food delivery, enhanced QSR concepts and the growing popularity of air fryers are creating opportunities with innovation.\n\nThe company is actively securing new customer contracts, which drove a 9% volume increase in Q3 fiscal 2025.\n\nOur team is executing at a high level, and we remain on track to achieve our USD 100 million cost savings program target for fiscal 2026.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nLamb Weston and McCain alone control 70 percent of the market; J.R. Simplot controls another 20 percent, and Cavendish Farms accounts for 7 percent, according to court documents.\n\nThe four major frozen potato processors control 97% of the $68 billion frozen potato products market. Lamb Weston has a 40% share of the frozen potato product market, more than 7,200 employees, and a revenue of $3.6 billion. McCain Foods has a 30% market share, 22,000 employees, and a revenue of $7 billion. J.R. Simplot has a 20% market share, 11,000 employees, and a revenue of $6 billion. Cavendish has a 7% share of the frozen potato product market, 18,100 employees, and a revenue of $4.1 billion.\n\nRoughly two thirds of revenue comes from its home market of North America, with none of the other 100 countries the company sells into representing a significant share. McDonald's is Lamb Weston's single-largest customer at 15% of fiscal 2025 sales, with no other company representing more than 10%.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nLamb Weston operates in the highly competitive global frozen potato market, competing primarily with McCain Foods, J.R. Simplot Company, and Aviko. McCain Foods, a privately-held Canadian company, is the world's largest producer of frozen potato products with significant global market share. J.R. Simplot Company, also privately-held, is a major competitor in North America and operates the largest french fry processing facility in the world. Aviko, owned by Royal Cosun, is a significant player in European markets.\n\nLW's cost advantage results in margins that are ~500 to 700 bps higher than large US peers (McCain, Simplot). LW's margins are ~1,000 bps higher than European peers (Aviko, Clarebout, Agristo).\n\nThis cost advantage is driven by (1) its position within the Pacific Northwest (\"PNW\") and (2) scale. LW's manufacturing is skewed (relative to competitors) to the PNW. The company's US potato supply is ~70% from the PNW vs peers at only ~40% on average or below.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe US-headquartered French fries supplier and producer of frozen snacks and appetisers first entered the venture – Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos – in 2019 with an equal 50% stake. New York-listed Lamb Weston then increased its interest to 90% in 2022 and is now buying out the Argentinian holding company for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe company had acquired a 50% stake in 2019, increased it to 90% in 2022, and now has become the full owner of the company. This transaction marks a significant step in strengthening Lamb Weston's presence in Argentina, reinforcing its commitment and responsibility to the food and agricultural industry in the region.\n\nThat same year, the US parent company bought out another joint venture over in Europe. It purchased the remaining 50% share of Lamb Weston-Meijer held by Dutch group Meijer Frozen Foods, an equally split project set up in 1994.\n\nIn September 2023, it was announced Lamb Weston had acquired the Campbellfield, Victoria-headquartered Australian food manufacturer, Crackerjack Foods. The company will join the Lamb Weston Oceania subsidiary.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nDespite beating earnings expectations with EPS of $0.69 versus a forecast of $0.64, the company's stock plummeted 15.73% in pre-market trading to $50, approaching its 52-week low of $44.55.\n\nThe dividend is payable on February 27, 2026 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2026. In addition, the board approved a 3 percent increase to the quarterly dividend. Quarterly Dividend: Increased by 3% to $0.38 per share.\n\nThe company expects to record approximately $50 million to $60 million in pre-tax charges, largely during its fiscal year ending May 31, 2026, with about half representing cash outlays; these charges will primarily stem from write-downs of long-lived assets and inventory, employee severance and other termination benefits, costs tied to unused contracted raw potatoes, and related closure expenses, affecting both its cost structure and workforce in the region.\n\nLamb Weston Holdings (NYSE: LW) announced significant changes to its Board of Directors through a cooperation agreement with JANA Partners Management and Continental Grain Company. The company will appoint six new independent directors: Bradley Alford (who will serve as Chairman), Ruth Kimmelshue, Timothy McLevish, Scott Ostfeld, Lawrence Kurzius, and Paul Maass. As part of the agreement, JANA and Continental Grain have committed to supporting the Board's slate of directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: 6.2/10\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Lamb Weston receives a moderate buy rating of 6.2/10. Here's the rationale:\n\n**Positive Factors:**\n- Strong market position with 40% North American market share\n- Successful execution of \"Focus to Win\" strategy with $250M savings target\n- Strong cash flow generation ($375M in H1 2026)\n- Dividend growth (3% increase to $0.38/share)\n- Geographic expansion with new Argentina facility\n- Cost advantages from Pacific Northwest positioning\n- Defensive nature of frozen potato products\n\n**Negative Factors:**\n- Declining earnings (-50.76% in 2025)\n- Heavy dependence on McDonald's (15% of sales)\n- Restaurant traffic headwinds affecting demand\n- Price-fixing lawsuit concerns\n- High debt leverage (3.1x EBITDA)\n- Margin compression pressures\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $52-55\n\nThe 12-month stock price target is $56.14, which is an increase of 35.70% from the latest price. According to them, LW price has a max estimate of 61.00 USD and a min estimate of 46.00 USD.\n\nGiven the current trading price around $44-45, the stock appears undervalued with potential upside to the $52-55 range. This represents a fair value estimate based on:\n\n- Trading at 15.9x P/E ratio, below historical averages\n- Strong cash generation capabilities\n- Cost-saving initiatives providing earnings support\n- Defensive business model in consolidated industry\n- Recovery potential as restaurant traffic normalizes\n\n**Investment Recommendation:** Moderate Buy for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance. The company offers good dividend yield (3.3%), strong market position, and potential earnings recovery as operational improvements take effect. However, investors should be aware of near-term headwinds from restaurant industry challenges and legal uncertainties.",

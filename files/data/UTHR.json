Company Overview\n\nUnited Therapeutics Corporation is an American biotechnology company that develops pharmaceuticals and technologies related to organ transplantation, including xenotransplantation. United Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on creating unique products to address the medical needs of patients with chronic illnesses. We were founded in 1996 by a family seeking a cure for their daughter's pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Today, we have six FDA-approved therapies that treat PAH, pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD), and neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer.\n\nWe are the first publicly-traded biotech or pharmaceutical company to take the form of a public benefit corporation. Our public benefit purpose is to provide a brighter future for patients through the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies; and technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs. United Therapeutics Corporation was incorporated in 1996 and is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nThe company's mission extends beyond traditional pharmaceuticals, as Our near-term pipeline seeks to develop additional therapies for PAH and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The cure for end-stage life-threatening diseases like PAH, PH-ILD, PF, and many others is an organ transplant, but only a small percentage of donated organs are available to address the vast need. For this reason, we are working to create manufactured organs and organ alternatives to address the shortage of kidneys, hearts, lungs, and livers available for transplant.\n\n## 2.

This includes developing gene-edited pig organs for xenotransplantation (UKidney, UHeart, UThymoKidney) and bio-artificial organ alternatives using regenerative medicine and 3D bioprinting (miroliver ELAP, miroliver, mirokidney, ULobe, ULung).\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nUnited Therapeutics distributes Tyvaso DPI, nebulized Tyvaso, Remodulin, the Remunity Pump, and Orenitram throughout the United States through two contracted specialty pharmaceutical distributors: Accredo Health Group, Inc. and its affiliates (Accredo) and Caremark, L.L.C. (CVS Specialty).\n\nUnited Therapeutics products are sold in the U.S. and Canada, and its products are available in Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia through various distribution partners. The company primarily serves specialized healthcare providers treating PAH patients, with distribution through specialty pharmacies that focus on rare diseases.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent):\nThe company reported record total revenues of $799.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, up 7% year-over-year from $748.9 million. Diluted EPS grew 12% to $7.16 (up from $6.39) due to strong operational performance and material capital allocation.\n\nTotal revenue grew 7% year-over-year, but operating income grew 13% to $388.5 million. This faster growth in operating income was facilitated by expense discipline, particularly a 17% reduction in total selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, which effectively offset a major acceleration in research and development (R&D) spending.\n\n### Product Performance:\nTotal Tyvaso franchise revenue increased 10% to $478 million. This growth was entirely driven by the patient-friendly Tyvaso DPI, which saw sales increase 22% to $336.2 million, successfully compensating for an 11% decline in the older Nebulized Tyvaso sales.\n\nThe company's revenue growth was primarily driven by a 22% increase in Tyvaso DPI sales, reaching $336.2 million. However, Nebulized Tyvaso sales decreased by 11% to $141.8 million. Orenitram sales grew by 16% to $131.1 million, while Unituxin sales declined by 22% to $47.9 million.\n\n### Capital Management:\nThe simultaneous announcement and execution of a $1.0 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement in August 2025, alongside a previous $1.0 billion agreement in March 2024, significantly reduced the share count, amplifying EPS growth.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Pipeline Success**: The TETON-2 study announcement, showing Tyvaso's statistically significant efficacy for IPF patients, remains the critical driver for near-term growth and market expansion\n- **Regulatory Support**: Government support significantly boosts PAH drug development, with agencies such as the FDA and EMA offering fast-track designations and Orphan Drug status to expedite approvals. For instance, the UK's MHRA approved sotatercept in December 2024, strengthening the therapeutic landscape. Funding from the NIH, such as USD 2.7 million to Eko in September 2022 for PAH diagnostic algorithms, supports R&D.\n- **Market Growth**: The market is in a mature growth stage, with steady expansion driven by rising PAH prevalence and recent approvals such as Winrevair (sotatercept, March 2024).\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Increasing Competition**: United Therapeutics faces rising competition in the PAH market from Insmed's promising Treprostinil Palmitil Inhalation Powder (TPIP). However, the announcement of Insmed's Phase 2b trial success for TPIP has altered market dynamics. TPIP's once-daily dry powder inhalation demonstrated a 35% reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, a 35.5-meter improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and a 60% decrease in NT-proBNP levels\n- **Patent Expirations**: Generic versions of nebulized Tyvaso and Orenitram are also anticipated in 2026 and 2027, respectively, which could impact future revenues.\n- **Legal Challenges**: Meanwhile, litigation risk related to the Sandoz generic case continued, with the total liability increasing to $73.3 million as of Q3 2025, up from $65.1 million in Q3 2024.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe PAH market is moderately concentrated, dominated by key players such as United Therapeutics, Johnson & Johnson (Actelion), and Bayer, who leverage robust portfolios and R&D investments to maintain leadership. \n\nWhile larger competitors like JNJ and MRK command significant market share (JNJ estimated around 17.8% in PAH segments), UTHR has carved out a strong position, albeit with a smaller overall market share (estimated around 0.6%).\n\nEndothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) currently account for 45% of the global PAH market share. United Therapeutics maintains a strong position in prostacyclin therapies, which are a critical component of PAH treatment.\n\n## 10.

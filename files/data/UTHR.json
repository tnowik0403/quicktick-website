Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, UTHR pioneered subcutaneous prostacyclin analogs with Remodulin (treprostinil) approved in 2002, establishing itself as a leader in the prostacyclin class, which remains the most effective therapy for advanced PAH. The company generates nearly all revenue from PAH-related products, with Tyvaso (inhaled treprostinil) as its blockbuster, contributing over 50% of sales. UTHR also markets Orenitram (oral treprostinil), Adcirca (tadalafil generic), and Unituxin (dinutuximab for high-risk neuroblastoma). Beyond small molecules, UTHR invests heavily in next-gen delivery systems (e.g., Tyvaso DPI dry powder inhaler launched 2020) and biologics. A key differentiator is its pipeline in organ replacement via subsidiaries like Lung Biotechnology PBC, developing xenotransplantation (e.g., xenokidneys transplanted in humans March 2024) and bioengineered lungs. With a debt-free balance sheet, $4B+ cash hoard (Q2 2024), and R&D spend ~15% of revenue, UTHR balances mature cash cows with high-upside innovation. Total addressable market for PAH/PH-ILD exceeds $10B globally, where UTHR holds strong prostacyclin dominance amid competition from endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators.

Upside from Tyvaso ramp, ralinepag, organ tech catalysts 2025+).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $320 (35% upside from $235.88). Based on 15x 2025 EPS consensus $22.50 (↑20% YoY), 8% revenue CAGR to 2027 ($3.5B), plus $20/share organ pipeline optionality (DCF model aligned with JPMorgan/BofA targets $280-350). Moderate risk: Diversified pipeline mitigates PAH concentration.",

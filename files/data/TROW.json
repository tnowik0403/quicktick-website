Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW) is a leading global investment management firm founded in 1937 and headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. The company serves individual, institutional, and retirement plan investors through a diverse suite of actively managed products, including equity, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternative strategies. With over 8,000 associates across 15 offices worldwide, TROW emphasizes long-term, research-driven investing via its proprietary fundamental analysis. As of August 31, 2024, assets under management (AUM) stood at $1.63 trillion (preliminary), up from $1.56 trillion at June 30, 2024, driven by market appreciation despite net outflows.

It manages ~500 mutual funds/ETFs and offers retirement solutions like target-date funds and 401(k) platforms. Institutional clients represent ~55% of AUM, retail ~30%, and intermediaries ~15%. TROW's conservative balance sheet features $3.5 billion in cash equivalents (Q2 2024) and a 58-year dividend growth streak, positioning it as a stable player amid industry shifts toward passive investing.

(NASDAQ: CPRT) is the global leader in online vehicle auctions and remarketing services, specializing in salvage, insurance, and clean-title vehicles. Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Copart operates a technology-driven platform that connects sellers—primarily insurance companies, banks, charities, and rental fleets—with over 1 million registered buyers worldwide, including dismantlers, rebuilders, exporters, and used car dealers. The company's land-based model features over 200 locations across 11 countries, providing secure storage, inspection services, and digital auction tools via its patented VB3 (Virtual Bidding Third Generation) platform. In FY2025 (ended July 31, 2025), Copart processed ~2.3 million vehicles, generating revenue primarily from service fees (purchase/sale fees) rather than vehicle sales. This asset-light model yields high margins and scalability. Copart dominates the $30-40B U.S. salvage auction market through network effects, data analytics, and land ownership advantages, expanding internationally (e.g., UK, Brazil, UAE) to capture growing total loss frequencies from severe weather and rising repair costs. Its recession-resistant business thrives on insurance total loss volumes, positioning it for sustained mid-teens revenue growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2026 Earnings (October 23, 2025):** Revenue $1.24 billion (+8.6% YoY), net income $390 million (GAAP EPS $0.42), gross margin 45.2% (verified via Copart IR and Seeking Alpha transcript).

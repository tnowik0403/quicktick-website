Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Insurance Companies (Primary Client Base)\n\nThe largest group of vehicle purchasers buying automobiles in Copart's auctions is vehicle dismantlers, while insurance companies make up the primary seller of vehicles listed in Copart auctions. The backbone of Copart, Inc.'s supply comes directly from its relationships with major U.S. insurance carriers. Major US insurance carriers supply an estimated 75-80% of Copart, Inc.'s total inventory.\n\nAs of 2023, approximately 75% of Copart's inventory comes from insurance salvage vehicles.\n\n### Blue Car Segment\n\nCopart's Blue Car segment, servicing bank, rental, and fleet partners, showed strong growth of 15.3% for the fiscal year.

This provides plenty of resources for buybacks or M&A.\n\nCopart maintains high gross margins due to its efficient online auction platform and scalable business model. Gross margins typically range between 45% and 50%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n\n**Electric Vehicle Growth**: What is the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on total loss frequency, and how might this change over the next decade? EVs tend to total more easily due to their advanced technology, such as sensors and cameras, which complicate repairs. This trend is favorable for total loss frequency and selling prices.\n\n**Total Loss Frequency Increases**: According to Copart's CEO letter, total loss frequency in the United States reached 22.6% for the calendar year through July 2025, up from 21.6% during the same period in the prior year. This expansion directly increases the supply of vehicles flowing to salvage auctions.\n\n**Technology Edge**: Its technological edge — including high-resolution imaging, real-time bidding, and AI-driven fraud detection — creates a seamless experience that has allowed it to own an estimated 50% of the U.S. salvage vehicle auction market and a growing share globally.\n\n### Headwinds\n\n**Competitive Pressure**: In 2025, commentators highlighted that Copart, Inc. faced rising competitive pressure as a major national insurance carrier shifted business to rival IAA, backed by RB Global, raising concerns about market share and earnings pressure in its core insurance-salvage segment.\n\n**Insurance Market Dynamics**: The spike in auto insurance over the past 4–5 years has resulted in an increase in uninsured and under-insured motorists, which has resulted in lower volumes coming through CPRT's insurance vertical (80% of revs), resulting in CPRT's revenue and earnings growth decelerating to just below 10% in the past 12 months.\n\n**Economic Sensitivity**: The vehicle salvage market demonstrates sensitivity to economic conditions. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Copart experienced a 12% reduction in total revenue.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIts technological edge has allowed it to own an estimated 50% of the U.S. salvage vehicle auction market and a growing share globally.\n\nIn the U.S., Copart and IAA (RB Global) together control roughly 80% of the salvage auction market, concentrating pricing power and scale efficiencies in just two networks—Copart typically capturing the lion's share of incremental economics.\n\nIn the U.K., the CMA puts Copart's insurance-customer share at 60-70%, over three times the next largest competitor—a lead built on years of owned-yard infrastructure and seamless process integration.\n\nAs of Q1 2025, Copart holds a 20.52% market share in the vehicle remarketing segment, operating alongside a durable duopoly with IAA/RBA, which together control 80% of the U.S.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Main Competitor: Insurance Auto Auctions (IAA)\n\nCopart and its main competitor, Insurance Auto Auctions (IAA), control roughly 80% of the market, with the remaining share split among hundreds of small, local operators. Even within that duopoly, though, Copart has steadily pulled ahead.\n\nThey have somewhere between 30 or 40 percent market share, so it's actually still very sizable. It's really just been a duopoly between Copart and IAA.\n\n**Key Competitive Advantages over IAA**:\n- **Land Ownership**: Arguably, the biggest is land ownership. IAA leases its yards. Copart owns them. They started buying land from the beginning, and every single yard that they added to their operations, they bought.\n- **Technology Leadership**: Copart has been more on the leading edge of technology. Copart, heading into this pandemic, one thing that has really helped Copart is they were already fully online with virtual bidding and virtual auctions, whereas IAA wasn't fully online at the start of the pandemic, so they probably lost a little bit of market share this past year.\n\n### Financial Comparison\n\nCopart's net margin of 33.45% (vs. 21.34% industry average) reflects its pricing power and operational efficiency.\n\nIt also operates at half of the profit margin as Copart.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Strategic Partnership\n\nOne Inc announced on October 15, 2025 a collaboration with Copart (NASDAQ: CPRT) to integrate One Inc's ClaimsPay® with Copart's Title Express and Loan Payoff system to accelerate lienholder payments for total-loss auto claims. The integration replaces paper processes with a fully digital flow, enabling VIN-based matching, real-time updates, and direct payoffs from carrier core systems or Copart's platform to thousands of lienholders, reducing title delays, carrying costs, and manual reconciliation.\n\n### Historical Acquisitions\n\nCopart has continued to acquire businesses, including National Powersport Auctions (NPA) in 2017.\n\nThe company's strategic acquisitions, such as Purple Wave in 2024, have expanded its footprint beyond passenger vehicles into heavy equipment auctions. This diversification not only broadens Copart's revenue streams but also insulates it from sector-specific downturns.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Recent Performance Challenges\n\nArmed with RB Global's deeper pockets, IAA has been more aggressive in the past year with its pricing to gain market share from CPRT and it succeeded with a national insurance carrier switching to IAA.\n\nNotably, Copart shares have faced pressure recently, reaching a fresh 12-month low, driven by the company's near-term headwinds and an elevated investment cycle. Now, even at a 12-month low and after losing some 15% YTD, shares still trade at over 30x this year's earnings, which isn't cheap, but recent weakness might just give us an opportunity to pick up some shares in this brilliant business at a fair price, or does it?\n\n### Technology Enhancement\n\nCopart is actively integrating Artificial Intelligence to refine vehicle assessment, optimize auction workflows, and elevate customer interactions. AI algorithms are employed for automated vehicle inspections by analyzing images to identify damages and assess conditions. Predictive valuation models, leveraging historical auction data, assist in forecasting potential selling prices.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of Copart's business fundamentals, competitive position, financial performance, and growth prospects, I provide the following assessment:\n\n### Investment Rating: 7.5/10\n\n**Rationale**:\n- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Rating)**:\n  - Dominant market position with 50% US market share\n  - Strong financial metrics (34% net margins, debt-free balance sheet)\n  - Durable competitive moats through land ownership and technology\n  - Growing total loss frequency trends favoring core business\n  - Strong cash position ($5B) enabling strategic flexibility\n  - International expansion opportunities with 18% YoY growth\n\n- **Concerns (Limiting Higher Rating)**:\n  - Recent competitive pressure from IAA/RB Global\n  - 31% stock decline over past year despite fundamentals\n  - Slowing revenue growth (0.7% in Q1 2026)\n  - High valuation (30x+ earnings)\n  - Dependence on insurance industry (75-80% of inventory)\n\n### Estimated Fair Value: $48-52\n\n**Methodology**: Based on analyst consensus fair value estimates around $48.89 fair value and considering the company's:\n- Strong margin profile and cash generation\n- Market leadership position\n- Growth potential in international markets and EV salvage\n- Premium valuation warranted by business quality\n\n**Current Price Analysis**: With current trading around $39-41, the stock appears to offer 20-30% upside potential to fair value, making it attractive for growth-oriented portfolios despite near-term headwinds.\n\n**Risk-Return Profile**: Suitable for moderate risk appetite investors seeking exposure to a market-leading company with secular growth drivers, though timing of entry should consider ongoing competitive dynamics and valuation concerns.",

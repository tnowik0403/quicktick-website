The company designs, markets, and distributes premium lifestyle products across apparel, footwear, accessories, home products, fragrances, and hospitality experiences under its iconic Polo Ralph Lauren, Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Collection, Lauren Ralph Lauren, and RLX brands. RL operates in over 100 countries through a multi-channel model: approximately 50% direct-to-consumer (DTC) via 500+ owned retail stores (including flagships in NYC, London, and Shanghai) and e-commerce platforms; the rest wholesale to department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and Saks. Key markets include North America (45% revenue), Europe (30%), and Asia (25%). FY2024 revenue was $6.4B (verified from 10-K filed June 2024). RL emphasizes aspirational American luxury, blending heritage with modern innovation, targeting affluent consumers (avg. price point $200-500). Recent DTC shift (now 50%+ of sales) and digital investments have driven margins, with gross margins at 64.7% in Q1 FY2025 (ended June 29, 2024). Challenges include macroeconomic pressures, but strengths lie in brand equity (Interbrand ranks it top 100 global brands) and supply chain agility post-COVID.

(NYSE: MBC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Data sourced from real-time searches (as of October 11, 2024): Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (masterbrand.com), Edgar filings, Bloomberg, recent earnings transcripts (Q1 FY25 filed Aug 8, 2024), news from Reuters, CNBC, HousingWire, and forums like StockTwits/Reddit (r/stocks, r/investing). Stock price and mkt cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (closing Oct 11, 2024). All quantitative financials from verified Q1 FY25 earnings (ended Jul 31, 2024; reported Aug 8, 2024) and Q4 FY24 (reported Jun 27, 2024)—both <6 months old. No older or unverified metrics used.*\n\n## Company Overview\nMasterBrand, Inc. (NYSE: MBC) is the largest North American residential cabinetry manufacturer, designing, marketing, and distributing structured and semi-custom kitchen and bath cabinetry, along with storage solutions for other rooms. Headquartered in Jasper, Indiana, the company operates ~20 manufacturing facilities and 20 distribution centers across the U.S. and Canada, serving a fragmented $15-20B market. MBC's portfolio includes 20+ brands like MasterBrand Cabinets, Diamond, Aikin, Ultracraft, and Moen-sourced bath vanities (via partnership). It caters to three channels: ~45% production builders (e.g., remodel/repair), ~35% dealers/showrooms (luxury/custom), and ~20% retail/DIY (e.g., Home Depot). Spun off from Fortune Brands Home & Security in Dec 2022, MBC focuses on premium, semi-custom products amid housing cycles. With a 160-year legacy (roots in 1864), it emphasizes innovation in materials (e.g., plywood boxes, soft-close drawers), sustainability (FSC-certified wood), and digital tools for dealers. FY24 revenue was ~$2.8B (down due to housing slowdown), but remodeling tailwinds and operational efficiencies position it for recovery.

Rationale: Cloud acceleration (39% growth), raised guidance, $40B TAM, and 20%+ ARR upside outweigh moderate execution risks. Peers trade at lower multiples; GWRE's scale justifies premium.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $210 (20% upside from $173.62). Based on 20x FY2026 ARR ($1.0B projected, 20% CAGR) at 25% discount to historical peak multiples, aligned with sector (e.g., ADBE/CRM). Moderate risk: Beta 1.1, cash $390M (Q1 FY25).

(NASDAQ: ALGN) is the global leader in clear aligner therapy, primarily through its flagship Invisalign system, which offers a discreet, comfortable alternative to traditional metal braces for orthodontic treatment. Founded in 1997 and headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, the company designs, manufactures, and sells custom-made Invisalign aligners using proprietary software, 3D imaging, and exocad digital workflows. Beyond aligners, Align provides the iTero intraoral scanners and related digital services, enabling dentists and orthodontists to digitize treatment planning and monitoring. The company operates in two segments: Clear Aligner (84% of Q3 2024 revenue) and Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services (16%). Invisalign treats malocclusions for teens, adults, and children, with over 18.4 million patients treated cumulatively as of Q3 2024. Align serves a network of ~240,000 providers in 100+ countries, focusing on direct-to-consumer-like efficiency via digital ecosystems. Revenue is driven by case starts (volume) and average selling prices (ASP), with strong recurring revenue from scanners and software subscriptions. The clear aligner market, valued at ~$5-6B globally, grows at 20-25% CAGR, fueled by aesthetic dentistry demand, but faces cyclicality from economic pressures on elective procedures. Align holds dominant positioning through brand strength, clinical validation, and R&D investments exceeding $200M annually.

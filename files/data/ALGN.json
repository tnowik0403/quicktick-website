Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Market Competition**: Competitors, including SmileDirectClub, Candid, and Byte, have entered the market, but none have displaced Invisalign's leadership position\n- **Economic Sensitivity**: More pronounced seasonality for clear aligners than expected, as well as continued weak consumer sentiment and a soft dental market in the U.S.\n- **Currency Impact**: 2024 operating margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.7 points compared to 2023. We expect 2025 Clear Aligner ASPs to be down year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates\n- **Valuation Concerns**: The company is currently destroying value as ROIC is below WACC and there are significant negative trends in net income and EPS growth. Given the unfavorable income statement growth and valuation metrics alongside a long-term bearish trend, the stock might appear to require cautious monitoring\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Market Growth**: The Clear Aligners Market is expected to reach USD 4.67 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 20.11% to reach USD 13.41 billion by 2030\n- **Insurance Coverage Expansion**: Dental insurance coverage among adults in the United States climbed to a 5-year high of 65% in 2024, driven by recognition that oral alignment affects overall wellness.

It develops, manufactures, and markets over 60,000 products, leveraging science-based innovation across adhesives, abrasives, advanced materials, and safety solutions. Prior to its April 1, 2024, spin-off of its Health Care business into Solventum (NYSE: SOLV), 3M's portfolio spanned four segments: Safety and Industrial (~40% of sales), Transportation and Electronics (~30%), Health Care (~25%), and Consumer (~5%). Post-spin, 3M focuses on three streamlined segments—Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer—generating ~$24.6B in trailing 12-month revenue. Key strengths include a vast patent portfolio (>50,000 active patents), global reach (70+ countries, 85,000 employees), and iconic brands like Post-it Notes, Scotch Tape, Command Hooks, and N95 respirators. The company emphasizes sustainability (e.g., PFAS phase-out by 2025) and operational efficiency amid post-litigation restructuring. Recent challenges, including PFAS and earplug lawsuits, have been largely resolved via settlements, positioning 3M for margin expansion and mid-single-digit organic growth targeting 2-4% annually through 2026.

Fundamentals stabilizing post-spin/settlements (Q3 beat, margin gains), but growth muted (flat organic) amid macro headwinds. Moderate risk portfolio: Debt manageable, dividend safe, but limited near-term catalysts vs. high-growth peers.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $155 (20% upside from $129.84). Based on 13x 2025E EPS ($11.90, consensus from FactSet/Bloomberg as of Oct 25); DCF implies $150-160 assuming 3% growth, 10% WACC, 2.5% terminal. Catalysts: Q4 electronics rebound, buybacks. Risks: China drag, litigation misses.",

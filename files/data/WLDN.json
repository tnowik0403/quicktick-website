Daily Volume:** 78,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nWilldan Group, Inc. (WLDN) is a provider of professional technical and consulting services, specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, engineering, and municipal outsourcing services. Founded in 1964 and headquartered in Anaheim, California, the company serves utilities, public agencies, private industry, and federal government clients across North America. Its core offerings focus on helping clients achieve energy savings, infrastructure resiliency, and regulatory compliance amid the energy transition.\n\nWilldan operates through two main segments: Energy (73% of Q2 2024 revenue), delivering efficiency programs, demand response, renewables integration, and EV infrastructure; and Engineering & Consulting (27%), providing water, transportation, and facilities engineering. The company leverages data analytics, engineering expertise, and turnkey implementation to deliver measurable ROI for clients.\n\nWith ~2,800 employees, Willdan has capitalized on U.S. infrastructure spending (e.g., IIJA, IRA) and decarbonization trends. In FY2023, it reported record revenue of $578M (up 22% YoY), driven by federal grants and utility contracts. Recent momentum includes a robust backlog exceeding $500M (as of Q2 2024), positioning it for sustained growth in a fragmented $100B+ engineering services market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 1, 2024)**: Revenue $180.2M (+24% YoY), gross profit $44.1M (24.5% margin, up from 23.1%), net income $9.3M (EPS $0.87 vs. $0.40 YoY), adjusted EBITDA $17.5M (9.7% margin). Backlog $542M (+15% QoQ). Guidance raised for FY2024 revenue to $725-765M and adj. EBITDA $60-64M (Seeking Alpha transcript).\n- **Major Contract Wins (Sep-Oct 2024)**: $48M California utility energy efficiency deal (Sep 2024); $30M federal resiliency project (Oct 2024 press release); total new awards ~$150M in H2 2024 YTD.\n- **Insider Buying**: CEO purchased 10,000 shares at $35 on Aug 5, 2024 (SEC Form 4).\n- **Analyst Coverage**: H.C. Wainwright initiated Buy rating with $50 PT (Sep 2024); Roth MKM raised PT to $45 (Aug 2024 post-earnings).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Organic Expansion**: Prioritize high-margin federal/utility work; invest in digital tools (e.g., AI-driven energy modeling) for 10-15% annual revenue growth.\n- **Backlog Conversion**: Target 25-30% YoY backlog growth to $700M+ by YE2024.\n- **M&A Pipeline**: $50-100M deployable cash for tuck-ins in resiliency/water sectors (CEO comments, Q2 call).\n- **Geographic Push**: Expand into Texas/Northeast via IRA-funded clean energy programs.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Record backlog; 24% Q2 revenue growth; margin expansion to 9.7% adj. EBITDA. | Labor shortages in engineering talent; project delays from permitting (Q2 call). |\n| **Sector (Engineering/Energy Consulting)** | IIJA/IRA funding ($1T+ opp.); decarbonization demand (utilities targeting 80% clean energy by 2030); EV/renewables boom. | Interest rate sensitivity (delays capex); election risk on green subsidies (Nov 2024). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Energy Segment**: Program management for efficiency rebates, demand-side management, LED retrofits, solar PV integration, EV charging.\n- **Engineering & Consulting**: Civil/transportation engineering, water/wastewater treatment, disaster recovery planning.\n- Key Revenue Drivers: 50%+ from utilities (e.g., PG&E, SoCal Edison), 30% federal (DOE, DoD).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Resiliency Suite (launched Q1 2024)**: Microgrid design and wildfire mitigation; $20M pipeline.\n- **AI Analytics Platform**: Predictive energy savings tool (pilot with 2 utilities, Q3 2024 rollout).\n- **EV Infrastructure Expansion**: $100M+ in planned federal grants for charger deployment (target H1 2025).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~1-2% in $120B U.S. engineering services (ENR rankings); #15 in energy efficiency consulting (Verdantix 2024 report).\n- **Forecast**: +200-300 bps gain to 2.5-3% by 2026 via federal wins; 15-20% CAGR revenue outpacing sector 5-7% (mgmt. guidance, backlog supports).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | WLDN | Tetra Tech (TTEK) | AECOM (ACM) | Stantec (STN.TO) |\n|----------------------------|------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Revenue** | $593M | $4.2B | $14.2B | $4.2B |\n| **Adj.

Moderate risk via diversified backlog, insider buys. Outperforms sector amid energy transition.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $55**  \n  (DCFF model: 18% IRR on FY2025E EBITDA $70M at 10x multiple + backlog premium; 28% upside from $42.85).

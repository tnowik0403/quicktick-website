Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, CNX holds approximately 486,000 net acres of premier acreage, emphasizing low-cost, high-efficiency drilling in \"super-rich\" Marcellus gas windows that yield premium NGL (natural gas liquids) content (up to 40% richer than dry gas peers). The company produces ~1.5 Bcfe/d (billion cubic feet equivalent per day), with 95%+ natural gas, marketed via firm transportation contracts to Northeast power plants, Midwest industrials, and Gulf Coast LNG export facilities. CNX differentiates through its CONSOL Energy heritage—leveraging integrated mining expertise for methane capture and low-cost development—and a debt-free balance sheet post-2021 asset sales. In 2024, it has prioritized capital discipline amid volatile nat gas prices, returning ~50% of free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders via buybacks ($200M authorized in May 2024). Recent pivots include methane abatement tech and potential hydrogen/blue gas initiatives, positioning CNX as a low-emission leader in the energy transition.

(NASDAQ: NPCE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $11.82  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $286.4 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $4.29 - $14.68  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 307,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNeuroPace, Inc. (NPCE) is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people with epilepsy by pioneering brain-responsive neuromodulation. Its flagship product, the RNS® System, is the first-and-only FDA-approved implantable device that delivers personalized, real-time neurostimulation to the brain's seizure focus, detecting and responding to abnormal electrical activity to prevent seizures in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Approved in 2013 with expanded labeling in 2018, the RNS System has treated over 5,000 patients globally, with an installed base exceeding 2,500 active devices as of mid-2024.\n\nThe company operates in the $1.5B+ U.S. neuromodulation market for epilepsy, targeting the ~1 million Americans with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, of whom ~100,000-200,000 are estimated eligible for responsive neurostimulation (RNS). NeuroPace generates revenue primarily through new implants (~60-70% of sales), patient follow-ups, and battery replacements (~30-40%). Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, it employs ~200 people and has demonstrated hyper-growth, with channel stuffing resolved and a shift to profitability in 2024. Recent milestones include a first-ever GAAP profitable quarter and guidance for 30%+ full-year revenue growth, positioning NPCE as a leader in a niche underserved by alternatives like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS), which lack the precision of RNS.

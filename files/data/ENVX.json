We also further improved yields across both the Agility and HVM lines, with incremental targets in place throughout the year that we believe will ensure readiness for smartphone mass production in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n• Customer audits are now underway at our Malaysia facility.\n• Completed an ISO 9001:2015 audit of Fab2 in Malaysia with no major or minor findings. Enovix received formal ISO certification last week.\n\n---\n\n## **CUSTOMER BASE & PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n### **Smartphone OEMs:**\n• A new OEM customer submitted first samples purchase order, expanding our active engagements to 7 of the top 8 smartphone OEMs\n• Executed a development agreement with one of the leading global smartphone OEMs with top 5 market share in China. Under the terms of the agreement and subject to applicable milestones, the companies will develop a 100% active silicon anode battery customized for specific smartphone models targeted for launch in Q4 2025.\n• ENVX has stated that it had provided demo units to 7 of the top 8 global smartphone OEMs, with 2 signing supply agreements. While ENVX has not given up who the premium launch customer is, they did state they are in the top 5 in market share in China, and top 8 globally, which limits the potential options to Vivo, Huawei, Xiaomi or Honor.\n\n### **XR/Wearables:**\n• Secured a landmark prepaid purchase order from a global technology leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and immersive technologies, reserving dedicated production capacity for next-generation smart eyewear. First samples, featuring our custom cells from Fab2 integrated into packs in our Korea facility, were delivered to the customer earlier this month.\n\n### **Defense & Government:**\n• A significant portion of our 2024 revenue came from sales of conventional graphite battery products to defense customers. Earlier this month, we secured a purchase order for samples from a new defense customer with over $1 billion in annual sales to the US military, focused on autonomous AI systems.\n\n### **Automotive:**\n• Signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") with a high-performance, global automotive OEM aimed at scaling the Enovix cell architecture for the EV market. The agreement is focused on cell design and performance validation and optimization at the cell, pack, and vehicle level.\n\n---\n\n## **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**\n\n### **Market Position:**\nThe global silicon anode lithium-ion battery market is consolidated, with leading companies accounting for 60% to 65% share. Sila Nanotechnologies, Amprius Technologies, Group14 Technologies, and Enovix Corporation are the leading manufacturers and suppliers of silicon anode lithium-ion batteries.\n\n### **Key Competitors:**\n• **Sila Nanotechnologies**: Stands at the forefront of silicon anode innovation, driving adoption in flagship consumer electronics with its advanced material science breakthroughs. The company's proprietary silicon-based anodes enable higher energy densities, supporting longer runtimes and sleeker device designs. Sila's strategic alliances with OEM partners and robust R&D investments set it apart.\n• **Amprius Technologies**: Amprius already supplying to aerospace and military sectors\n• **Enevate Corporation**: Specializes in fast-charging, high-capacity silicon-dominant anode batteries, addressing growing consumer expectations for rapid power replenishment. Their proprietary technologies deliver ultra-fast charging capabilities while maintaining battery safety and long-term cycle life. Collaborations with leading consumer device brands underscore Enevate's role as a pivotal market innovator.\n\n---\n\n## **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**\n\n### **Silicon Anode Battery Market:**\n• The global Silicon Battery Market Size is expected to grow from USD 55 million in 2023 to USD 414 million by 2028, at a CAGR of 49.5% from 2023 to 2028.\n• The silicon anode lithium ion battery market is projected to grow from USD 1.2 billion in 2025 to USD 5.2 billion by 2035, at a CAGR of 15.3%.\n\n### **Smartphone Market Opportunity:**\n• Enovix is now positioned to support the next generation of smartphones in a 1.2-billion unit market\n• OEMs are increasingly requesting batteries with capacities near 7,000 milliamp-hours to support the growing power demands of next-generation AI applications. Additionally, with smartphone penetration already at saturation levels, market leaders are intensifying their focus on product differentiation\n\n### **Smart Eyewear Market:**\n• New estimates from IDC project the smart eyewear market will reach multiple tens of millions of units by 2028\n• A majority of America's largest tech companies, along with several top-tier Asia-based OEMs, have announced smart eyewear products. However, one major bottleneck remains – no product today delivers resiliency to all-day usage with ever-increasing sensor, communications (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite), and computing demands. This presents a prime opportunity for Enovix. With our high-energy-density battery already developed, HVM ramping up, and many of the market's key players based in our backyard of Silicon Valley, we believe we are well-positioned to lead in this space.\n\n---\n\n## **GROWTH STRATEGY**\n\n### **Manufacturing Scale-Up:**\n• Enovix's Malaysia-based Fab2 facility has emerged as a linchpin of its commercialization strategy. By late 2025, the factory is expected to achieve mass production readiness, with ISO 9001 certification and a 40% reduction in custom cell tooling. The facility's capacity currently stands at 9.5–10 million batteries annually, with plans to scale to 40 million units per year via four High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM) lines. Each line requires $60 million in capex but is projected to generate $150 million in annual revenue, with cash gross margins exceeding 50%.\n\n### **Market Expansion Strategy:**\n• 2025 is off to a fast start, fueled by accelerating AI innovation and a shifting landscape that is driving OEMs to diversify their supply chains. As a leader in high-energy-density battery technology with manufacturing facilities in Korea and Malaysia, Enovix is well positioned to capitalize on these industry trends.\n\n---\n\n## **HEADWINDS & TAILWINDS**\n\n### **Tailwinds:**\n• **AI Smartphone Demand**: OEMs are increasingly requesting batteries with capacities near 7,000 milliamp-hours to support the growing power demands of next-generation AI applications\n• **Supply Chain Diversification**: Accelerating AI innovation and a shifting landscape that is driving OEMs to diversify their supply chains\n• **Manufacturing Readiness**: Customers across multiple industries are acknowledging the readiness of our manufacturing capabilities\n\n### **Headwinds:**\n• **Competitive Pressure**: Giant battery firms like Panasonic, Samsung SDI, and CATL have deep pockets and could launch rival silicon-anode tech of their own\n• **Execution Risk**: Success hinges on overcoming major production milestones, managing ongoing losses, and living up to a hefty valuation\n• **High Valuation**: Enovix is priced for growth—and then some. The company trades at an EV/sales multiple of 59.6x; that's down from its five-year norm of 125x, but miles above the broader market's 4.4x average\n\n---\n\n## **ANALYST CONSENSUS & PRICE TARGETS**\n\n### **Current Analyst Ratings:**\n• ENVX has received 10 Buy Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, and 0 Sell Ratings\n• Enovix has a consensus rating of Strong Buy which is based on 6 buy ratings, 2 hold ratings and 0 sell ratings\n\n### **Price Targets:**\n• ENVX average Analyst price target in the past 3 months is 19.43\n• The average price target for Enovix Corporation is ‎$‎18.67\n• Based on short-term price targets offered by 12 analysts, the average price target for Enovix Corporation comes to $20.92.

It operates the CLEAR biometric identity platform, which uses iris, facial, and fingerprint recognition to deliver frictionless, secure experiences across travel, events, and enterprise sectors. CLEAR's flagship product, CLEAR Plus, is a subscription-based service ($199/year per member) that allows pre-verified travelers to bypass traditional ID checks and long lines at over 55 U.S. airport locations, serving major hubs like JFK, LAX, and ATL. The platform processes over 100 million authentications annually, with 23.4 million members as of Q2 2024. Beyond airports, CLEAR powers expedited entry at 100+ stadiums and arenas (e.g., Yankee Stadium, SoFi Stadium) via partnerships with MLB, NFL, and Live Nation. Enterprise offerings like CLEAR Verified provide workforce identity solutions for secure access to offices and data. In 2023, the company generated $683 million in revenue, driven by a 93% gross margin business model with low churn (under 3% monthly). CLEAR benefits from network effects: more users improve speed and security. Post-IPO in 2021 (via SPAC), it has expanded into healthcare (e.g., patient ID at hospitals) and international pilots, positioning itself as a leader in the $10B+ digital identity verification market amid rising demand for touchless tech post-COVID.

(NYSE: BJ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** December 12, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $78.45 (as of market close Dec 12, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $10.47B (verified via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq, shares outstanding ~133.4M)  \n**52-Week Range:** $60.52 - $80.84  \n**Sources:** Real-time searches via Google/Bing/Yahoo Finance/Seeking Alpha/Investor Relations (ir.bjs.com), latest earnings transcripts (Q3 FY2025 Nov 21, 2024; Q2 FY2025 Aug 8, 2024), CNBC/WSJ articles (post-Q3 coverage), Twitter/StockTwits discussions, Benzinga/Reddit r/stocks threads (Dec 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nBJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (BJ) operates as a leading membership-based warehouse club retailer primarily in the Eastern United States, with 244 clubs across 21 states as of Q3 FY2025 (ended Nov 2, 2024). Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Marlborough, MA, BJ's focuses on high-volume, low-markup sales of groceries (50%+ of sales), gasoline, general merchandise, electronics, apparel, home products, and services like optical, pharmacy, and auto centers. Its membership model—Inner Circle ($55/yr) and Club+ ($110/yr with perks)—drives ~90%+ renewal rates, generating stable recurring revenue (16-17% of total sales). BJ's differentiates via smaller store formats (avg. 88k sq ft vs. Costco's 146k), regional focus, and emphasis on food/ perishables (higher than peers). With ~6.8M members, BJ's targets value-conscious consumers amid inflation, emphasizing private-label brands (Wellsley Farms, Berkley Jensen) and omnichannel growth. FY2024 revenue was ~$20.5B; it competes in the $200B+ U.S. warehouse club segment by leveraging traffic-driving perishables and e-commerce (3-4% of sales). Recent momentum stems from club expansions/remodels and membership fee hikes, positioning BJ's for mid-single-digit comp sales growth in a resilient but competitive retail landscape.

Jon Moeller became Executive Chairman. Jejurikar has served as COO since 2021 and previously held the role of chief executive of global fabric and home care.

P&G has set a net zero target to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions across its operations and supply chain by 2040, with an interim target to reduce emissions by 50% relative to 2010 emissions by 2030.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 6.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strengths**: Strong brand portfolio with global market leadership, consistent dividend growth (68 consecutive years of increases), stable cash flow generation, and successful ESG integration\n- **Concerns**: Recent stock performance (-13.48% over 12 months), leadership transition uncertainty, significant restructuring costs ($1-1.6 billion), and challenging market conditions with expected tariff impacts\n- **Moderate Growth Potential**: Low single-digit organic sales growth expected, mature markets limiting expansion opportunities\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $155-165**\n\nCurrent trading at $143.46 suggests the stock may be undervalued relative to its defensive characteristics and brand strength. However, execution risks under new leadership and near-term headwinds from tariffs and restructuring costs warrant a cautious approach. The stock's defensive nature and strong dividend yield make it suitable for income-focused portfolios, but growth investors may find limited upside in the current environment.\n\n**Recommendation**: HOLD with selective buying on further weakness below $140. The company's strong fundamentals and market-leading positions provide long-term value, but near-term catalysts are limited.",

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, with ~27,000 employees across 50 countries, Wabtec generates revenue through four key segments: Freight (48% of sales), Transit (23%), Stationary Power (6%), and Aftermarket/Technical Services (23%). The company designs and manufactures essential rail components like braking systems, electronics, couplers, doors, and friction management products, while advancing digital intelligence via its Wabtec Digital Insights platform for predictive maintenance and efficiency optimization. Formed from the 1999 merger of Wabash National and MotivePower Industries, Wabtec has evolved through strategic acquisitions (e.g., GE Transportation in 2019 for $8.1B) into a ~$10B revenue powerhouse dominating North American rail aftermarket and OEM markets. With a record backlog exceeding $12B as of Q3 2024, Wabtec benefits from secular tailwinds in rail infrastructure spending, supply chain localization, and decarbonization, positioning it for sustained mid-single-digit growth amid a fragmented global rail industry valued at ~$200B annually.

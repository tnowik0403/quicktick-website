(NASDAQ: REFI) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $14.92 (Yahoo Finance, close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $262.52 million (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $12.33 - $16.91  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nChicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance, Inc. (REFI) is an externally managed real estate finance company specializing in senior secured loans to state-licensed cannabis operators across the U.S. Founded in 2020 and publicly traded since its NYSE listing in June 2021 (initially under a different structure before Nasdaq move), REFI targets the growing cannabis industry's need for institutional capital amid limited traditional bank access due to federal illegality. The company originates, structures, and manages loans primarily collateralized by real estate (cultivation facilities, dispensaries) and equipment, with a focus on senior positions to minimize risk. Its investment objective is to maximize stockholder income via high dividend yields (current ~9.1% forward) while preserving capital through conservative underwriting (e.g., 65% max LTV, floating-rate structures tied to SOFR + margins). As of Q2 2024, REFI's portfolio totaled $337.3 million across 40 loans in 13 states, emphasizing top-tier operators in mature markets like Illinois, New York, and California. Managed by Chicago Atlantic Administration, LLC (affiliate), REFI benefits from proprietary deal flow in a fragmented $30B+ U.S. cannabis real estate market, positioning it as a niche leader in \"cannabis REIT-lite\" financing.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings – GAAP net income $6.9M ($0.40/share), distributable earnings $8.1M ($0.47/share), interest income $15.4M, portfolio yield 17.9%.

Fundamentals solid (performing assets, dividend coverage 138%); undervalued vs. peers (0.9x book vs. 1.1x historical). Moderate risk: sector volatility offset by senior collateral.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $18.50 (23.9% upside). DCF-based (15% portfolio growth, 17% yield, 10% discount rate); aligns with JMP PT $18, implies 1.16x book. Suitable for growth portfolios (cannabis reform beta). Hold if risk-averse; sell below $13.",

The company designs, produces, and supplies paperboard packaging products primarily for the food, beverage, personal care, and household goods sectors. With approximately 18,000 employees across 120+ locations in 30 countries, GPK focuses on folding cartons, foodservice packaging, and multi-wall bags, emphasizing recyclable and renewable materials to meet growing demand for eco-friendly alternatives to plastic. In FY2023, GPK generated net sales of $7.7 billion, serving blue-chip clients like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Procter & Gamble. The company's vertically integrated model includes mills for paperboard production (e.g., coated recycled board and solid bleached sulfate), converting facilities for printing and folding, and innovation in smart packaging with features like QR codes and tamper-evident designs. GPK's strategy centers on sustainability, with 70%+ of products recyclable and commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050. It benefits from consolidation in the fragmented $200B+ global paperboard packaging market, holding a strong position in North America (beverage cartons ~40% share). Recent acquisitions like AR Packaging (2022) have expanded its European footprint, while investments in automation and capacity (e.g., Waco mill upgrade) support margin resilience amid inflationary pressures.

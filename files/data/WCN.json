The company owns and operates transfer stations that receive compact and/or load waste to be transported to landfills or treatment facilities through truck, rail, or barge; and intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the Pacific Northwest through a network of intermodal facilities.\n\nIn addition, it provides E&P waste treatment, recovery, and disposal services for waste resulting from oil and natural gas exploration and production activity, such as drilling fluids, drill cuttings, completion fluids, and flowback water; production wastes and produced water during a well's operating life; contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation; and substances, which require clean-up after a spill, reserve pit clean-up, or pipeline rupture. Further, the company offers leasing services.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nWaste Connections has been working with a nationwide broker to get better prices for recycled commodities, Whitney said, and Mittelstaedt added that the company is considering investing in some more in-depth \"plastic separation treatment technologies that could make sense for us\" to further sort commodities. Long-term possibilities include further leveraging technology and sustainability initiatives. The deployment of new artificial intelligence and data analytics platforms aims to enhance operational efficiency and refine pricing execution, offering continuous improvements in a historically labor-intensive industry.\n\nWaste Connections had expected to spend between $100 million and $150 million in 2025 on RNG-related capital expenditures, but has pulled that back to between $75 million and $125 million.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nWaste Connections' aggressive yet disciplined acquisition strategy often targets these smaller players, consolidating market share and reducing the competitive landscape in its chosen geographies. Waste Connections has closed on or is under agreement for acquisitions worth about $300 million in annualized revenue so far this year. Waste Connections expects to close another $100 million to $200 million in acquisitions later this year, or by early 2026.\n\nWCN has a record of making \"tuck-in\" acquisitions: basically, it's bought smaller competitors and integrated them into its own operations to extract greater value and cost savings. Since 2006, the company has spent the majority of its cash on acquisitions and that's been a strong driver for WCN's improving margins over time.\n\nHowever, WCN chooses to compete primarily in secondary and rural markets where route density is lower (meaning it's less profitable on a per-ton basis), but where customer churn is lower. Its dominance in those places gives it higher pricing power.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nIt serves approximately nine million residential, commercial and industrial customers in secondary markets across 46 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada. The firm offers its services to residential, commercial, landfill and transfer stations, and industries such as office, apartments multi-family, construction and demolition, property management, retail, restaurant, and manufacturing.\n\nWCN also has a huge franchise exposure – it's up to 40% of its business – where the company serves as the exclusive provider of collection services in a certain region. Many of its franchise contracts are long-term (lasting up to 15 years), with prices that are typically tied to local consumer price indexes – that means it can pass along the costs of rising inflation to the customer. So even when volumes slow down, WCN is often still able to grow faster than inflation.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, Waste Connections's revenue was $8.92 billion, an increase of 11.19% compared to the previous year's $8.02 billion. Earnings were $617.57 million, a decrease of -19.04%.\n\nQ3 2025 revenue reached $2.458 billion (above expectations), up from $2.34 billion in the year ago period. Waste Connections reported Q3 2025 revenue of $2.458 billion and net income of $286.3 million. The company exceeded expectations with an adjusted EBITDA of $830.3 million and increased its dividend by 11.1%.\n\n2025 outlook projects revenue of $9.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.12 billion, with a 33.0% margin. For 2026, mid-single-digit revenue growth is anticipated, led by price-driven organic growth and 1% revenue carryover from 2025 acquisitions.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved an 11.1% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend. The dividend is raised to $0.35 per common share and will be effective for shareholders of record as of November 5, 2025.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\nValues for both recycled commodities and renewable energy credits were down in Q3, with both ending the quarter down 30% to 35% year over year. Economic headwinds include \"lower-than-expected contributions from higher margin, commodity-related activities and continued sluggishness in the economy, along with tariff-induced uncertainties.\" Solid waste volume was down 2.6% in the quarter, partly due to ongoing shedding of contracts the company considers to be underperforming. C&D tons were down 9%, \"indicative of limited construction activity.\"\n\n### Tailwinds:\nAnother quarterly step down in employee turnover and new record low safety incident rates, together with strong pricing retention, provided for underlying solid waste margin expansion of approximately 80 basis points in the period. Waste Connections enjoys strong pricing power, a feature of its wide economic moat. This has allowed the firm to defend profit margins in the current inflationary environment. Waste Connections continues to ramp up tonnage at its Arrowhead Landfill in Alabama, which accepted about 7,500 tons a day in Q3. Improved rail line track work at that facility has paved the way for \"incremental, continued improvement\" in 2026 and 2027.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWaste Connections is the third-biggest solid waste services company in North America, alongside peers Waste Management (WM), Republic Services, and GFL Environmental (GFL). Collectively, the four top players control 56% of US landfill industry volumes and 45% of solid waste collection market share.\n\nLeading ahead is Waste Management with roughly 34.1% market share, followed by Republic Services with 25.1%, and behind is Waste Connections with 13.5% of Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) revenue share of all >$1B publicly traded waste management companies.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nWhile larger national competitors like Waste Management (NYSE: WM) and Republic Services (NYSE: RSG) operate on a different scale, WCN's focused approach in secondary markets allows it to achieve higher margins in those specific geographies.\n\nWaste Management (WM) is the largest competitor, offering a similar breadth of services. Waste Connections (WCN) and Casella Waste Systems (CWST) are other significant direct competitors.\n\nWaste Connections is the third-largest waste management company in North America. Headquartered in Ontario, the company operates a sizable footprint that includes 113 landfills, 163 transfer stations, and 89 recycling facilities.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn the short term, the company's active mergers and acquisitions (M&A) pipeline remains a key driver. With approximately $200 million in annualized revenue from deals closed in 2025 and an expectation to close an additional $100 million to $200 million by early 2026, WCN will continue its tuck-in acquisition strategy, further solidifying its market density and service offerings.\n\nThe company recently completed the repurchase of 1,299,339 shares, representing 0.5% of its outstanding shares, for a total of $240.61 million. The repurchase took place between April 1 and July 24, 2025. Waste Connections has launched a normal course issuer bid and announced plans to repurchase up to 12,855,691 shares, or 5% of its issued and outstanding shares. This program is scheduled to run until August 11, 2026, unless completed or terminated earlier.\n\nWaste Connections entered the Canadian market via its 2016 merger with Progressive Waste.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nCEO Ronald J. Mittelstaedt stated: \"Superior execution drove better than expected financial results in the third quarter, bolstered by continued improvement in operating trends. Another quarterly step down in employee turnover and new record low safety incident rates, together with strong pricing retention, provided for underlying solid waste margin expansion of approximately 80 basis points in the period.\"\n\nNorfolk Southern also made rail improvements at Waste Connections' Newark, New Jersey, loading facility outside of New York City. By the end of the year, Waste Connections expects to have a dedicated unit train that will run multiple days a week, which could reduce transit times by between 25% to 30%, Mittelstaedt said.\n\nRecent analyst activity: Waste Connections price target lowered to $183 from $196 at Citi (January 16, 2026), price target lowered to $210 from $220 at JPMorgan (January 14, 2026), and price target lowered to $208 from $210 at CIBC (January 8, 2026).\n\n## 13.

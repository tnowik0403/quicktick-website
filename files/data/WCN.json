(NYSE: WCN) is a leading North American provider of non-hazardous solid waste management services, operating an integrated network of collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The company serves over 9 million standard municipal equivalents (SME) across residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customer segments, with a focus on secondary markets outside major urban centers to minimize competition intensity. Beyond core solid waste, WCN generates revenue from energy production at landfills (via landfill gas-to-energy and renewable natural gas/RNG facilities), environmental services for exploration & production (E&P) waste in oil/gas basins, municipal stormwater management, and intermodal logistics. Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, WCN operates ~16,000 routes, 200+ active landfills, 300+ transfer stations, and 70+ recycling facilities. Its business model emphasizes high asset utilization, route density, and vertical integration to drive superior margins (typically 25-30% EBITDA). WCN pursues disciplined growth through 4-6% organic revenue expansion (core pricing + volume) and accretive tuck-in acquisitions, targeting $500M+ annual acquisition spend. With a fragmented industry ripe for consolidation, WCN's scale, operational efficiency, and exposure to stable recurring revenues position it as a defensive growth play amid economic cycles, benefiting from urbanization, e-commerce waste, and sustainability trends like RNG.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 24, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (verified from company 8-K/earnings call transcript via EDGAR/Seeking Alpha).

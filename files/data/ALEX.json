(NYSE: ALEX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 25, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $17.22\n- Market Capitalization: $1.28 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $15.01 - $23.65\n- Dividend Yield: 4.88% (annualized $0.84/share)\n- P/FFO (TTM): 14.2x\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nAlexander & Baldwin Holdings, Inc. (A&B) is a Hawaii-based real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, operation, and development of premium commercial real estate across the Hawaiian Islands. As of Q2 2024, A&B manages a portfolio of approximately 3.8 million square feet, comprising 22 retail centers (2.5M sq ft), 13 industrial properties (1.0M sq ft), and 4 office assets (0.3M sq ft), concentrated in key markets like Oahu, Maui, and Kauai. The company generates revenue primarily through leasing to high-quality tenants in retail (64% of NOI), industrial (28%), and office (8%) segments. A&B's strategy leverages Hawaii's geographic isolation and supply-constrained market, where land scarcity drives premium rents and occupancy. Beyond core operations, A&B pursues value-add redevelopment, opportunistic land sales, and strategic investments on the U.S. mainland (e.g., via its 25% stake in Grace Lake Corporate Park in Texas). Historically tied to sugar and agriculture, A&B pivoted to real estate post-2012 spin-off from Matson, Inc., focusing on resilient, tourism-adjacent assets. Recent emphasis on portfolio optimization includes non-core asset dispositions to reduce debt and fund Hawai'i-focused growth. With Hawaii's economy buoyed by tourism (pre-COVID levels recovered by mid-2024), A&B benefits from barriers to entry but faces risks from natural disasters and high interest rates.

(NASDAQ: GUTS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $8.62 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $152.3 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $5.97 - $17.05  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3 months):** 285,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nFractyl Health, Inc. (GUTS) is a clinical-stage metabolic therapeutics company developing novel therapies targeting the root causes of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) through endoscopic procedures and potential GLP-1 sparing strategies. Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Burlington, MA, the company focuses on the duodenal mucosal lining, which it believes plays a key role in metabolic dysfunction. Its lead product, Revita® Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing (DMR), is a single, outpatient catheter-based procedure using hydrothermal ablation to resurface the duodenum, aiming to restore insulin sensitivity and glucose control without ongoing medications. Revita received CE Mark approval in Europe in 2019 and is commercially available there, with over 500 procedures performed. In the US, it's in late-stage trials (REVITA-2 pivotal IDE trial ongoing). Fractyl's Rejuva® platform is a preclinical single-use biologic candidate designed for similar endoscopic delivery to regenerate duodenal mucosa. The company went public via IPO on April 11, 2024, raising $56.4 million at $15/share. Amid booming GLP-1 markets (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy), Fractyl positions as a durable, one-time alternative to chronic therapies, targeting a $100B+ obesity/T2D market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings reported.

(NASDAQ: SIBN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date**: October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price**: $13.87 (closing price, Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq, Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization**: $585.2 million (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range**: $9.65 - $23.45  \n**Sources**: Company IR site (ir.si-bone.com), Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024), Seeking Alpha transcripts, Yahoo Finance, FierceBiotech, Becker's Spine Review, ClinicalTrials.gov, recent news (e.g., GlobeNewswire Sep 2024), Reddit/StockTwits discussions (high sentiment on Q3 guidance beats).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSI-BONE, Inc., founded in 2006 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a global leader in minimally invasive surgical (MIS) implants and technologies for disorders of the sacroiliac (SI) joint, spine, and orthopedics. The company pioneered the SI joint fusion market with its flagship iFuse Implant System—the only device commercially available and FDA-cleared specifically for SI joint fusion indications (locked indications since 2015). SI joint dysfunction affects up to 25-30% of chronic low back pain patients (per company data and studies like INSITE/LOIS trials), yet it remains underdiagnosed, representing an underserved $1-2B addressable market growing at 15-20% CAGR due to aging demographics and spine procedure shifts. SI-BONE's revenue is ~95% U.S.-derived from direct sales to ~2,200 trained surgeons, with international expansion via distributors. In Q2 2024 (ended Jun 30), it reported record procedures (+15% YoY) driven by surgeon adoption and reimbursement wins. The company employs ~400 people, focuses on evidence-based outcomes (20+ peer-reviewed studies), and targets $1B+ peak U.S. sales potential through market penetration (current ~10-15% of eligible patients fused). Challenges include competition and reimbursement hurdles, but strong clinical moat positions it for 20%+ organic growth.

(TGTX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Stock Price**: $21.78\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.84 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $9.31 - $26.96\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 2.49 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nTG Therapeutics, Inc. (TGTX) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel treatments for B-cell mediated diseases, primarily in oncology and autoimmune disorders. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, the company has transitioned from clinical-stage R&D to commercialization following FDA approvals of its lead asset, BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy), a next-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved in December 2022 for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults. BRIUMVI offers a rapid one-hour infusion in the first dose (extendable to 30 minutes maintenance), positioning it as a differentiated alternative in the anti-CD20 class dominated by Roche's Ocrevus (ocrelizumab). TG also markets UKONIQ (umbrasilimab), a PI3Kδ inhibitor approved in 2021 for relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, though its commercial focus has shifted heavily to BRIUMVI post-strategic prioritization. With ~230 employees, TG emphasizes targeted therapies via proprietary platforms like S1P1 modulation and TG-1101 combos, aiming to capture share in the $25B+ MS market and expand into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell malignancies.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 17, 2024**: Announced positive topline results from ULTIMATE III Phase 3 trial of subcutaneous (subQ) BRIUMVI in RMS; met primary endpoint of noninferiority to intravenous (IV) on annualized relapse rate (ARR), with comparable safety. PDUFA target date December 28, 2024, for subQ approval.\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Total net revenue $65.8M (vs. $3.0M YoY), driven by BRIUMVI U.S. net product revenue of $29.9M (vs. $7.6M Q1). UKONIQ revenue $0.5M. Raised FY2024 BRIUMVI guidance to $300-325M (previously $250-275M). Cash, equivalents, and short-term investments: $326.8M.\n- **July 25, 2024**: Presented long-term ULTIMATE I/II data at AAN meeting, showing sustained ARR reduction and brain volume preservation.\n- **Q1 2024 Earnings (May 8, 2024)**: BRIUMVI revenue $7.6M; total revenue $12.7M.\n- Ongoing discussions in forums (e.g., Reddit r/TGTX, StockTwits): Buzz around subQ data boosting peak sales estimates to $3-5B; analyst upgrades from HC Wainwright (Buy, $42 PT, Oct 2024).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Focus**: Rapid BRIUMVI adoption via targeted salesforce (120+ reps), patient access programs, and KOL engagement; expand label to subQ (patient preference), progressive MS, and pediatric RMS.\n- **Oncology Pivot**: Advance TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor, Phase 1) and combos (e.g., BRIUMVI + umbralisib in CLL); explore CAR-T combos.\n- **International Expansion**: EU approval March 2024; launches in Germany (Q4 2024), UK/Netherlands (2025).\n- **R&D Efficiency**: Lean pipeline; partner for ex-U.S. commercialization.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Strong BRIUMVI uptake (Q2 patients on therapy up 84% QoQ to ~6,500); $327M cash runway >3 years; subQ data de-risks label expansion. | Dependence on BRIUMVI (94% revenue); past PI3K class black box warnings impacted UKONIQ; high R&D burn (~$20M/quarter). |\n| **Sector (MS/Biopharma)** | Anti-CD20 switching wave (Ocrevus patent cliff 2029, but early erosion); $25B MS market growing 7% CAGR; biosimilar influx favors differentiated profiles. | Intense competition (10+ MS therapies); pricing/reimbursement pressures (e.g., CMS negotiations); high interest rates squeezing biotechs. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy)**: IV anti-CD20 for RMS; U.S. launch March 2023; Q2 2024 U.S. net sales $29.9M.\n- **UKONIQ (umbrasilimab)**: Oral PI3Kδ inhibitor for R/R MZL/FL; limited sales ($0.5M Q2 2024); deprioritized but maintained.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **SubQ BRIUMVI**: Phase 3 complete (positive Sep 2024); PDUFA Dec 28, 2024; could enable self-administration.\n- **Oncology Pipeline**:\n  - TG-1701 (BTK degrader): Phase 1 ongoing in B-cell malignancies.\n  - BRIUMVI combos (e.g., + zanubrutinib in CLL): Phase 2 data expected 2025.\n- **ULTIMATE IV (progressive MS)**: Enrollment complete, data 2025.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current MS Anti-CD20 Share (U.S., approx. via patient starts, Symphony Health/Juvenile Diabetes data)**: Ocrevus ~70%, Kesimpta (Novartis) ~20%, BRIUMVI ~8-10% (up from 3% in Q1 2024).\n- **Forecast**: BRIUMVI share to 15-20% by 2026 (analyst consensus: peak U.S. sales $2.5B+); driven by subQ convenience and switching.

(FRST) is a leading real-time estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in industrial and logistics properties across the United States. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, FRST owns, manages, develops, redevelops, and acquires high-quality industrial real estate, primarily Class A facilities in 19 major U.S. markets including Southern California, New York/New Jersey, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Atlanta, Chicago, and the Carolinas. As of Q3 2024, the portfolio totals approximately 64.1 million square feet of industrial space and 0.9 million square feet of office space (primarily serving as property management offices), with a weighted average lease term of 5.2 years and in-service occupancy of 98.1%.\n\nFRST focuses on supply chain-oriented logistics properties proximate to key transportation infrastructure (ports, airports, highways), benefiting from e-commerce growth, nearshoring, and manufacturing reshoring trends.

YOC); 5.6M sq ft potential starts.\n  - Recent: 254K sq ft build-to-suit for FedEx in Atlanta (Sep 2024 start).\n  - Planned: 1M+ sq ft spec in Carolinas/Dallas for 2025 delivery.\n- **Redevelopments**: $50M invested Q3 2024; targeting value-add in legacy assets.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~1-2% of U.S. institutional industrial market (total ~15B sq ft; FRST 64M sq ft). #5-7 among public industrial REITs by sq ft (per NAREIT).\n- **Growth/Decline Forecast**: +3-5% annualized sq ft growth through 2026 (via 2-3M sq ft annual deliveries/acquisitions); stable 1.5-2.5% share in core markets (SoCal/NY 2-3%) per Green Street/MSCI data. Risks: Supply wave could pressure to 0.5-1% decline if absorption slows <100M sq ft/yr.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q3 2024 or Latest) | FRST      | Prologis (PLD) | Rexford (REXR) | STAG Industrial | EastGroup (EGP) |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Portfolio (M sq ft)       | 64.1     | 1,300         | 52            | 115             | 59              |\n| Occupancy                 | 98.1%    | 97.0%         | 98.5%         | 96.5%           | 98.7%           |\n| AFFO Growth YoY           | +5.0%    | +8%           | +12%          | +4%             | +7%             |\n| Net Debt/EBITDA           | 5.2x     | 4.8x          | 4.5x          | 5.8x            | 5.0x            |\n| Market Cap                | $7.0B    | $110B         | $12B          | $7.5B           | $8.2B           |\n| YTD Total Return          | +25%     | +15%          | +10%          | +18%            | +22%            |\n\n*FRST trades at discount to peers on P/FFO (15x vs. sector 18x); stronger occupancy but slower growth than PLD/REXR.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Joint ventures with institutional investors (e.g., 2023 JV with CPP Investments for $500M developments); build-to-suits with FedEx, UPS.\n- **Recent M&A**: $300M SoCal acquisition (Aug 2024); $450M portfolio sale (Q2 2024); active in $1-2B annual deployment.\n- **Major Clients**: FedEx (build-to-suit tenant), XPO Logistics, DHL; potential: Amazon expansions, auto manufacturers (nearshoring).\n- **Other Qualitative**: Strong ESG (ENERGY STAR certified 80% portfolio); insider ownership 0.5%; Moody's Baa2 credit rating.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Moderate Buy/Hold with Upside)**  \n  Rationale: Resilient fundamentals (high occupancy, 7% YOC developments) and industrial tailwinds outweigh rate headwinds; undervalued vs. peers (20% NAV discount per Green Street Oct 2024). YTD +25% return lags sector recovery potential. Suitable for moderate risk/growth portfolios targeting 10-15% annualized total return.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $62.00 (17% upside from $52.92)  \n  Based on 16x 2025 AFFO ($3.75/share est. per management guidance) + 5% terminal growth; DCF-aligned with 7% cap rate on stabilized NOI. Risks: Fed cuts delay (probability 30%), recession absorption drop.",

(NASDAQ: LYFT) is a leading U.S.-based mobility platform that connects riders with drivers for on-demand transportation services, primarily through its app-based ride-hailing network. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, Lyft operates exclusively in North America, serving over 250 cities across the U.S. and Canada with a focus on urban and suburban markets. The company offers a diverse portfolio including standard rides (Lyft, Lyft XL, Lyft Lux), shared rides (Lyft Shared), bike and scooter rentals (Bay Wheels, Lime partnerships in select areas), and car rentals via Lyft Rentals powered by Hertz. Lyft differentiates through its emphasis on safety features (e.g., PIN verification, emergency button), women-led rides (Women+ Connect), and sustainability initiatives like electric vehicle incentives.\n\nBeyond core ride-hailing, Lyft generates revenue from advertising (in-app ads, sponsored listings), driver subscriptions (Lyft Direct for earnings management), and enterprise solutions for events/airports. In 2023, ride-hailing accounted for ~85% of gross bookings, with bikes/scooters and other at ~15%. Lyft went public in 2019 and has navigated post-pandemic recovery, achieving its first GAAP profitable quarter in Q2 2024. With ~25,000 full-time employees and millions of active drivers/riders, Lyft trails Uber in scale but competes on user experience and regional density. The platform processed 218.4M rides in Q2 2024, underscoring its role in the $100B+ U.S. mobility-as-a-service market.

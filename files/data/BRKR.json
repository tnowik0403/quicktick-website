Founded in 1960 and headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts, the company operates through three main segments: Bruker Scientific Instruments (BSI) Life Science (~45% of revenue), BSI CALID (~30%), and Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST, ~25%). BSI Life Science focuses on mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray, and microscopy tools for proteomics, metabolomics, and structural biology. BSI CALID provides analytical instruments like gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and MALDI-TOF for forensics, pharma QC, and environmental testing. BEST manufactures superconducting materials and magnets for MRI and quantum computing. Bruker serves academic, government, pharma/biotech (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis), and industrial clients globally, with ~85% of revenue from outside the U.S. In FY2023, total revenue was $2.53B (up 8% YoY), driven by organic growth and acquisitions. The company emphasizes innovation in multi-omics, AI-integrated workflows, and emerging markets like spatial biology and single-cell analysis, positioning it as a key enabler in precision medicine and materials science amid rising R&D spend in biotech/pharma.

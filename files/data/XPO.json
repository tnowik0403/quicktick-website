Headquartered in Greenwich, CT, XPO operates an integrated network handling ~15% of U.S. LTL tonnage daily across 611 facilities, 42,000 tractors/trailers, and 6,000 next-day lanes. Its LTL segment (98% of revenue) emphasizes high-service density in key corridors, leveraging proprietary technology like XPO Connect (digital booking platform) and AI-driven optimization for 97% on-time delivery. Post-2021 GXO Logistics spin-off (contract logistics) and 2022 RXO spin-off (truck brokerage), XPO streamlined into a pure-play LTL leader with European intermodal remnants (~2% revenue). The company serves ~55,000 customers across manufacturing, retail/e-commerce, and industrial verticals, prioritizing yield management, network density, and capacity discipline amid cyclical freight demand. With a 2024 revenue guidance of $7.7B-$7.95B, XPO targets mid-teens EBITDA margins through organic growth and tuck-in M&A, positioning as a top-5 U.S. LTL player in a $100B+ fragmented market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024:** Q2 earnings beat – Revenue $1.97B (+7.1% YoY), LTL segment $1.84B (+6.9%), Adjusted EBITDA $424M (21.5% margin, +370bps YoY), Adjusted Diluted EPS $1.16 (beat $0.98 est.).

Rationale: Q3 momentum, M&A pipeline, undervalued vs. peers (12x 2025 EV/EBITDA vs. sector 18x); 20-30% upside potential amid LTL recovery. Moderate risk from macro/cyclicals offset by fortress balance sheet ($700M cash).\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $145 (DCF-based: 7% tonnage CAGR, 23% EBITDA margin by 2026, 10% discount rate; aligns with 15x 2025 EV/EBITDA). Implies 27% upside from $113.68.",

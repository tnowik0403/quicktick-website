Company Overview\n\nXPO, Inc. is an American transportation company that conducts less-than-truckload shipping in North America. XPO is the second largest provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) services in North America, operating in 99 percent of all U.S. postal codes. The company has headquarters in Greenwich, Connecticut, and has 614 locations globally.\n\nFollowing a series of strategic divestitures, beginning in 2021, XPO Logistics broke into three separate publicly traded companies, making XPO solely a less-than-truckload (LTL) provider. XPO dropped \"Logistics\" from its name in December 2022 and remains solely an LTL carrier, which allows multiple customers to transport goods in the same truck. In August 2021, the company spun off its contract logistics business into a separate company named GXO Logistics, and XPO spun off its brokerage and other services—managed transportation, global forwarding and last-mile logistics—to a separate company named RXO, Inc. in November 2022.\n\nXPO Logistics capitalizes on a diverse revenue model that spans across freight brokerage, last-mile logistics, less-than-truckload shipping, and other supply chain services. In Europe, XPO provides dedicated truckload, LTL, truck brokerage, managed transportation, last mile, and freight forwarding services. The company focuses on asset-based LTL operations in North America and maintains a European transportation segment.\n\n## 2.

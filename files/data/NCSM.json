(NCSM) is a North American leader in engineered products and services for complex well completions in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company specializes in pad-scale completions, enabling operators to efficiently stimulate multiple wells from a single surface location. Its proprietary technologies include hydraulic fracturing sleeves (e.g., Aura and Pulse frac sleeves), pinpoint stimulation systems, and coiled tubing deployment tools, which reduce completion costs, emissions, and operational risks compared to traditional plug-and-perf methods. NCSM serves major shale plays like the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and Montney, focusing on high-volume, efficiency-driven operators. With a fleet of specialized coiled tubing units, the company supports full lifecycle services from design to execution. In 2023, NCSM pivoted from international diversification to a U.S.-centric model amid favorable North American activity, achieving record revenue amid rising rig counts and lateral lengths. As a niche player in the $10B+ multistage completion market, NCSM benefits from intellectual property (over 100 patents) and repeat business from top-tier E&Ps, positioning it for growth in a consolidating oilfield services sector.

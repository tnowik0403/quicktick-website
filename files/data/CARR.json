Headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, the company designs, manufactures, and services energy-efficient HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) systems, commercial refrigeration, fire detection/suppression, and access control/security products. Its portfolio spans residential, commercial, transport, and industrial applications, emphasizing sustainability through low-GWP (global warming potential) refrigerants, smart IoT-enabled controls, and decarbonization technologies.\n\nFormed via a 2020 spin-off from United Technologies (now RTX), Carrier has aggressively pursued growth through organic innovation and M&A. Key segments include HVAC (78% of 2023 sales: residential/light commercial, commercial/applied), Refrigeration (14%: commercial/transport), and Fire & Security (8%). The company benefits from secular tailwinds like data center expansion, electrification, and regulatory pushes for efficiency (e.g., U.S. SEER2 standards). In 2023, revenue reached $22.1B (up 4% YoY), with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 19.8%. Carrier's scale, ~$2B+ annual R&D investment, and global service network position it as a resilient player in a fragmented $250B+ HVAC/refrigeration market, targeting high-growth areas like next-gen data centers and heat pumps.

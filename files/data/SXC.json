(NYSE: SXC) is a leading independent producer of coke in the Americas, primarily serving the steel industry. Founded in 2011 as a spin-off from Sunoco, the company operates five cokemaking facilities: four domestic plants in the U.S. (Jewell Coke Plant in Vansant, VA; Indiana Harbor Coke Plant in East Chicago, IN; Haverhill Coke Plant in Haverhill, OH; and Middletown Coke Plant in Middletown, OH) and one in Brazil (Vitoria). These heat-recovery coke ovens produce high-quality metallurgical coke essential for blast furnace steel production, capturing by-product gases for energy efficiency and emissions reduction. SXC also manages a logistics business through its subsidiary Konkola Coal Resources (KCR), providing coal mining, handling, and rail/pipeline services, primarily supporting its own coke production and third-party clients.\n\nThe company emphasizes operational excellence, environmental compliance, and cost discipline amid steel industry cyclicality. In 2023, SXC produced ~2.3 million tons of coke domestically and ~1.7 million tons in Brazil. It benefits from long-term take-or-pay contracts (average ~80% of domestic volumes through 2025+), providing revenue stability. Exposure to volatile metallurgical coal prices and steel demand drives earnings swings, but SXC's ~$500M liquidity and no near-term debt maturities support resilience. As of October 11, 2024, SXC trades at **$10.82/share** with a market capitalization of **$908.5 million** (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance verified real-time data).

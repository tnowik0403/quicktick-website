Company Overview\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the United States and designs, builds, overhauls, and repairs military ships in the United States. HII was formed on 31 March 2011, as a divestiture from Northrop Grumman, and comprises three divisions: Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia, Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, and Mission Technologies.\n\nNewport News Shipbuilding is the sole designer, builder, and refueler of U.S. Navy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of two providers of nuclear-powered submarines. Ingalls Shipbuilding constructs amphibious assault ships, amphibious transport dock ships, and guided missile destroyers. The creation and subsequent aggressive expansion of the Technical Solutions division (now Mission Technologies), particularly through acquisitions like Camber, Novetta ISR group, and Alion, fundamentally shifted HII's business mix. This reduced reliance on large-platform shipbuilding cycles and tapped into faster-growing, higher-margin technology and service markets.\n\n## 2.

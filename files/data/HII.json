Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, HII operates through three main segments: Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS), Ingalls Shipbuilding, and Mission Technologies. NNS, the largest U.S. industrial employer in Virginia, builds all U.S. Navy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (e.g., Ford-class CVN) and a significant portion of Virginia-class submarines, with emerging work on the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines. Ingalls, based in Mississippi, produces Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyers, San Antonio-class (LPD 17) amphibious transport docks, and Legend-class National Security Cutters (NSC) for the U.S. Coast Guard. Mission Technologies provides C5ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), fleet sustainment, and unmanned systems. With a record backlog exceeding $47 billion as of Q3 2024, HII benefits from long-term multi-year contracts tied to U.S. national security priorities, including countering peer competitors like China. The company employs ~44,000 people and generates stable revenues from fixed-price and cost-plus Navy contracts, positioning it as a critical enabler of U.S. maritime dominance amid rising geopolitical tensions.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 31, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings released.

Revenue CAGR 5% projected.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric | HII | General Dynamics (GD/NASSCO/EB) | BAE Systems (US) | Notes |\n|--------|-----|---------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| **2024 Est. Revenue** | $11.5B | $15B+ (shipbuilding) | $5B | HII leads nuclear/large surface. |\n| **Backlog** | $47.5B | $40B+ | $10B | HII highest funded %. |\n| **Margins (EBITDA)** | 10.5% (Q3) | 9-10% | 8-9% | HII premium on fixed-price wins. |\n| **Key Strengths** | Carriers/subs | Subs/tankers | Electronics/repairs | HII 20% cheaper on destroyers (GAO). |\n| **Market Cap** | $11B | $80B (total) | N/A (UK-listed) | HII undervalued vs. peers (EV/EBITDA 10x vs. 12x). |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Team Sub (w/GD Electric Boat) for Virginia/Columbia subs; Bechtel for propulsion.\n- **M&A**: Acquired Alion Science (2022, $1.7B) for Mission Tech; no major 2024 deals, focus organic.\n- **Current Major Clients**: U.S. Navy (80% revenue), U.S. Coast Guard (10%); $9B+ annual Navy awards.\n- **Potential Clients**: Australia (AUKUS subs via Team Sub), NATO allies for cutters/frigates; FMS pipeline $2B+.\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy for growth upside). HII offers defensive growth (5-7% CAGR) with $47B backlog insulating vs. downturns, tailwinds from FY2025 NDAA ($923B defense top-line), and 20%+ upside to peers. Moderate risk from execution delays offset by 10x EV/EBITDA valuation.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $330/share (18-20% upside from $277). Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($1.4B est., 10% margin on $14B rev), DCF with 5% growth/8% discount, analyst consensus ($295 avg target, Barclays $320 Nov 1 PT). Ideal for growth portfolios seeking defense stability. Hold if risk-averse to overruns.",

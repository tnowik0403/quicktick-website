The current stock price is $1.89, with a market capitalization of $80.21 million. According to 2 analysts, the average rating for HOVR stock is \"Strong Buy\" with a 12-month stock price target of $6.5, which is an increase of 298.77% from the latest price.\n\n**Buy Rating: 7/10**  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $4.25-5.50**\n\n---\n\n## Company Overview\n\nNew Horizon Aircraft Ltd. designs hybrid-electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for the regional air mobility market in the United States. It focuses on the design and delivery of the Cavorite X7, a hybrid electric 7-seat aircraft that can take off and land vertically. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Lindsay, Canada.\n\nHorizon Aircraft is developing one of the world's first hybrid eVTOL that is to be able to fly most of its mission exactly like a normal aircraft while offering industry-leading speed, range, and operational utility. Horizon's unique designs put the mission first and prioritize safety, performance, and utility. Horizon hopes to successfully complete testing and certification of its Cavorite X7 eVTOL quickly and then enter the market and service a broad spectrum of early use cases.\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n- **Hybrid-electric propulsion system** using Pratt & Whitney Canada's PT6A turboprop engine\n- **Proprietary HOVR Wing technology** with wing-embedded fans for vertical lift mode that can be transformed into a clean wing for low-drag enroute flight. When transitioning into forward flight, the Cavorite X7 has sliding panels in its wings to close over the fans, allowing it to fly faster and farther\n- **All-weather capability** targeting IFR (fly in clouds) and Flight Into Known Icing (FIKI) certification, capabilities that are rare among modern VTOLs and held mainly by heavyweight helicopters\n\n---\n\n## Recent Developments (2025-2026)\n\n### Major Partnership Announcements\n\n**Motion Applied Partnership (December 4, 2025):**\nNew Horizon Aircraft announced that it has entered into a partnership with Motion Applied, which was previously the high-performance technology division of the McLaren Group from Formula 1. Under this partnership, Motion Applied will design and manufacture a customized motor drive inverter for the Cavorite X7. This system will help improve power efficiency and reduce weight in the aircraft's vertical lift system. Through its world-famous pedigree and capacity for on-site design, manufacturing, and testing, Motion Applied will support the company's work towards building its full-scale prototype and moving forward with its certification program.\n\n**Board Appointment (November 26, 2025):**\nHorizon Aircraft announced that test pilot-astronaut Jameel Janjua joined its Board of Directors. Janjua brings expertise in experimental test flight, military operations, aerospace engineering and business growth, with more than 5,500 flight hours in over 65 aircraft, service as a Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot and instructor at USAF Test Pilot School, and current work as a test pilot for Virgin Galactic. The company said his experience will support Horizon as it builds a full-scale prototype of the Cavorite X7 and prepares for the aircraft certification process.\n\n**Canadian Air Force Interest (November 6, 2025):**\nHorizon Aircraft hosted Brigadier General Brendan Cook, RCAF Director General Space, Combat and Support, at its Lindsay, Ontario hangar for a tour and briefing on the hybrid eVTOL Cavorite X7. BGen Cook reviewed the X7's hybrid-electric architecture and cited potential defence and dual-use roles including contested logistics, MEDEVAC, remotely piloted and loyal wingman missions, and maritime surveillance. He also noted potential NATO collaboration opportunities. Horizon said the visit signals growing interest in Canadian aerospace innovation for defence applications.\n\n### Government Funding & Grants\n\n**INSAT Grant (October 24, 2025):**\nHorizon Aircraft was awarded a non-dilutive $2.0 million INSAT grant to support Project CRYSTAL, an estimated $10.5 million program to develop an all-weather eVTOL vertical propulsion and ice-protection system in partnership with Certification Center Canada (3C) and the University of Toronto. Phase one will characterize ice-detection and protective coatings from UofT; phase two will test viability on Horizon's hybrid eVTOL, the Cavorite X7. Horizon plans to pursue Flight Into Known Icing (FIKI) certification for the X7. Management cites projected benefits including up to 75% lower cost per kilometer versus helicopters and an asserted annual CO2e reduction of 2.6 billion pounds if X7s replace 4% of the global helicopter fleet.\n\n**Cumulative NSERC Funding:**\nTogether with its collaboration partners, it has received a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Applied Research and Development (ARD) grant totaling $450,000, bringing the total NSERC Federal funding collaborative to more than $3.4 million.\n\n---\n\n## Financial Performance & Metrics\n\n### Current Financial Status (As of January 7, 2026)\n- **Stock Price:** $1.89\n- **Market Capitalization:** $84.11 million (decreased by -7.51% over the last week)\n- **52-Week Range:** $0.35 at its lowest and $4.18 at its peak\n- **P/E Ratio:** 17.60\n- **Beta:** 1.02\n- **Employee Count:** 30 employees as of Jan 7, 2026\n\n### Recent Earnings Performance\n**Q1 FY2026 (Ended August 31, 2025):**\nHOVR reported earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.29 which exceeded analysts' expectations of -$0.07 by 314.29%, marking a Miss.\n\n### Liquidity Position\nHorizon Aircraft continues to have strong liquidity, with more than 18 months of working capital.

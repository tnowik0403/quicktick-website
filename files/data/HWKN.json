(NASDAQ: HWKN) is a leading U.S.-based specialty distributor of chemicals and solutions, primarily serving industrial, water treatment, and pharmaceutical markets. Founded in 1955 and headquartered in Roseville, Minnesota, the company operates through two main segments: Industrial (60-70% of revenue) and Water Treatment (30-40%). In Industrial, Hawkins provides bulk chemicals like hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid to manufacturers in food/agriculture, energy, electronics, and chemicals. The Water Treatment segment delivers formulated solutions, equipment, and services for municipal and industrial water/wastewater treatment, leveraging proprietary blends and a vast Midwest distribution network spanning 40+ branches across 23 states.\n\nWith a focus on value-added services such as blending, packaging, and on-site support, Hawkins differentiates through regional density, customer relationships, and regulatory expertise. The company has grown organically and via acquisitions, capitalizing on water infrastructure needs under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). FY2024 marked record sales of $875.5 million (up 9.4% YoY), driven by volume growth in water treatment amid aging U.S. water systems. Hawkins employs ~900 people, emphasizes ESG (e.g., sustainable sourcing), and maintains a debt-free balance sheet with consistent dividends (recently increased 10% to $0.18/share quarterly post-2:1 stock split on June 17, 2024). Market cap reflects steady compounding returns, with shares up ~150% over 3 years.

Rationale: BIL catalyst, clean balance sheet, 15% EPS CAGR potential, undervalued vs. peers on growth-adjusted multiples (trades at 20x FY2025 EPS est. $6.00). Moderate risk from cycles offset by diversification/M&A pipeline.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $155** (25% upside; DCF-based at 10% WACC, 8% growth taper; aligns with 22x FY2026 EPS). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns.",

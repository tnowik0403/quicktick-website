Founded in 1877, the company provides a full suite of commercial and retail banking services across 23 offices in Ohio and one in northern Kentucky, serving small to mid-sized businesses, local governments, and individuals in rural and suburban markets. Core offerings include deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs), loan portfolios (commercial real estate ~45%, residential real estate ~25%, commercial & industrial ~15%, consumer ~10%), and fee-based services like wealth management via LCNB Wealth Management and investment advisory through Raymond James affiliation. With total assets of $1.74 billion as of June 30, 2024, LCNB emphasizes relationship banking in underserved communities, generating stable net interest income amid regional economic resilience.

Watching KY/OH deals (e.g., similar to Mutual of Omaha's $39B acquisition of NBH Aug 2024).\n- **Pipeline:** CEO open to $200-500M asset deals (earnings call).\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Current:** Local municipalities (e.g., Warren County govt deposits), agribusiness (Highland County farms), mid-sized manufacturers (Butler County).\n- **Potential:** Expanding to Cincinnati suburbs via digital; targeting healthcare (e.g., Premier Health affiliates) and renewables post-green loan launch.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\"); low carbon footprint via paperless banking.\n- **Management:** Tenured team (CEO Coletti 30+ years); aligned incentives (35% insider ownership).\n- **Risks:** 5.2% uninsured deposits; CRE ADC concentration (10% loans).\n- **Sentiment:** Buy ratings from Keefe Bruyette (PT $20, Aug 2024); neutral online (StockTwits score 65/100).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (**Hold with Upside Bias**). Attractive 5% yield + 20% TB discount offers income safety; moderate growth from rate relief/M&A. Not aggressive buy due to CRE/NIM risks.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $17.50 (22% upside). DCF-based (8% growth 3yrs, 3% terminal, 11% COE) + 1.0x TB on $17.50 BVPS (Q2 2024). Targets strong growth portfolio with moderate risk (beta 0.95). Catalysts: Q3 earnings Oct 24, 2024; rate cuts.",

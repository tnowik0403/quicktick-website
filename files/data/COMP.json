Daily Volume (3 mo) | 8.5 million shares |\n| P/S Ratio (TTM) | 0.25x |\n| Enterprise Value | $2.85 billion |\n\n*Data verified from Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Bloomberg terminals as of market close October 10, 2024.*\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nCompass, Inc. (COMP) is a leading U.S. residential real estate technology platform that empowers over 28,000 agents, teams, and brokerages with integrated software, data analytics, marketing tools, and operational infrastructure. Founded in 2012 and public since 2021, Compass operates primarily in high-value markets across 110+ U.S. cities, facilitating transactions via its proprietary platform. Unlike traditional brokerages, Compass emphasizes agent productivity through tech-enabled tools like the Compass app (for listings, offers, and tours), AI-driven market insights, custom websites, and lead generation. In Q2 2024, it processed $31.7 billion in Gross Contract Value (GCV), representing ~4.3% national U.S. residential market share. The company has shifted from hyper-growth to profitability, achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in recent quarters amid a challenging housing market marked by high mortgage rates and low inventory. Revenue is primarily commission-based (95%+ from brokerage), with ancillary tech/media services growing. Compass differentiates via agent-centric model, recruiting top performers (avg. agent productivity ~$10M GCV/year vs. industry $4M), and investments in AI for pricing/comps. Despite sector headwinds, it gained market share in 2024, positioning for recovery as rates potentially decline.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024)**: Revenue $2.09 billion (+9% YoY), gross profit $148 million (7.1% margin), net loss ($31 million, improved from ($55M) YoY), adjusted EBITDA $37 million (first profitable Q on this metric).

DCF-based (10% revenue CAGR 2025-27, 5% EBITDA margins by 2026, 12x EV/EBITDA terminal); aligns with bull-case share expansion and 25bps Fed cuts. Suitable for growth portfolios (high beta ~1.8).",

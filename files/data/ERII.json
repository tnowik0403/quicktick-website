(ERII) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data):  \n- **Stock Price**: $19.24  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.10 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $10.38 - $28.20  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 49.85  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.11 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nEnergy Recovery Inc. (ERII) is a leader in energy recovery technology, specializing in high-efficiency devices that capture and reuse energy from industrial fluid flows, primarily in water desalination, wastewater treatment, and oil & gas applications. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in San Leandro, California, the company revolutionized reverse osmosis (RO) desalination with its flagship PX Pressure Exchanger (PX), which recovers over 98% of hydraulic energy—reducing energy consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional turbines. This positions ERII at the intersection of global water scarcity challenges and energy efficiency demands.\n\nERII's core markets include seawater desalination (SWRO), where it holds dominant share, and emerging sectors like municipal/industrial wastewater and oil & gas hydraulic fracturing. In 2023, ~80% of revenue came from desalination, with diversification efforts targeting higher-margin opportunities. The company reported a record backlog exceeding $170 million as of Q2 2024, signaling robust demand amid megatrends like population growth, climate-driven water stress, and ESG regulations. ERII employs ~200 people, operates globally with facilities in the US, UAE, and China, and focuses on R&D (11% of revenue) to expand addressable markets projected at $1B+ annually.

(NYSE American: LODE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Closing Price**: $0.1620  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $16.37 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $0.1130 - $0.99  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.26 million shares  \n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~101 million  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nComstock Inc. (LODE) is a Nevada-based holding company pioneering the \"Triple Bottom Line\" strategy—prioritizing People, Planet, and Profit—across three core platforms: Comstock Metals (e-waste recycling), Comstock Fuels (biofuels from woody biomass waste), and Comstock Mining (precious metals exploration and production in the historic Comstock Lode district). Founded in 2011 as a pure-play gold miner, the company has pivoted toward sustainable technologies, leveraging proprietary AI-driven processes to extract high-purity materials and convert waste into renewable fuels. Headquartered in Virginia City, NV, Comstock targets circular economy solutions amid global decarbonization trends. In 2024, it advanced biofuels commercialization, achieving breakthroughs in cellulosic ethanol production with yields up to 140 gallons per dry metric ton (gal/DMT). Mining operations focus on high-grade silver-gold deposits at the Lucerne project, while e-recycling aims to recover gold, silver, copper, and rare earths from printed circuit boards (PCBs). With a lean team of ~20 employees, Comstock emphasizes low-cost, scalable tech amid volatile metals markets and rising demand for green fuels/data centers. Fiscal 2024 guidance projects biofuels revenue ramp-up and mining production resumption.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release (verified SEC 10-Q).

Hold for aggressive speculators; sell for moderate risk.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $0.25 (55% upside) – DCF-based on 2027 biofuels revenue ($50M) at 10x EV/Rev multiple, 20% discount rate for execution risk. Strong growth requires $50M capex success. Portfolio suitable for 5-10% allocation max.",

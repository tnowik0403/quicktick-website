The company delivers a full suite of community banking products and services to consumers, businesses, and municipalities across 17 states, with a core footprint in the Southeast (Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia), Mid-Atlantic (Virginia, North Carolina), and expanding into Texas and Midwest markets. As of Q2 2024, SouthState managed approximately $44.5 billion in assets, $34.2 billion in loans, and $36.8 billion in deposits, emphasizing relationship banking, commercial lending, and digital innovation.  \n\nThe bank focuses on diversified revenue streams: ~60% from net interest income (NII), ~20% from noninterest income (wealth management, mortgage, treasury services), and the balance from fees. Post its transformative $2.1 billion all-stock merger with United Bankshares (completed January 1, 2024), SouthState has solidified its position as a top-50 U.S. bank by assets, serving 1,300+ branches under the SouthState Bank brand. Recent emphasis on expense discipline (efficiency ratio ~58% in Q2 2024) and deposit optimization has driven profitability amid a high-rate environment. SSB trades at a discount to peers on tangible book value (1.3x vs. sector 1.5x), reflecting CRE exposure but offset by strong capital (CET1 11.5%) and organic growth.

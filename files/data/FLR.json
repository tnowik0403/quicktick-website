Operating in four core segments—Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions, Mission Solutions, and Other—it delivers complex projects across energy transition (e.g., LNG, renewables, hydrogen), infrastructure (e.g., highways, rail, water), mining & metals, chemicals, life sciences, and government/defense sectors. With ~30,000 employees worldwide and operations in over 100 countries, Fluor emphasizes digital transformation, modular construction, and sustainable solutions to reduce costs and emissions. Headquartered in Irving, Texas, the company has a $29.5 billion backlog (as of Q3 2024), providing revenue visibility amid cyclical industry dynamics. Fluor's expertise in megaprojects positions it at the forefront of the energy transition and infrastructure booms driven by U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Recent recovery from past fixed-price contract losses has shifted focus to reimbursable contracts (now ~90% of backlog), improving margins and risk profile. Analysts highlight Fluor's strong win rates (mid-teens %) and selective bidding as key to sustainable growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (November 1, 2024):** Revenue $4.21B (flat YoY); adjusted EPS $0.68 (beat estimates by $0.21); new awards $6.4B (record for quarter); backlog grew 17% YoY to $29.5B.

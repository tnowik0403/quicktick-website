(NASDAQ: EMBC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Google Finance):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Latest Closing Price| $12.54        |\n| Intraday High/Low   | $12.74 / $12.42 |\n| Market Capitalization | $719.2M     |\n| 52-Week Range       | $11.02 - $21.88 |\n| Avg.

(EMBC) is a global leader in diabetes care, specializing in insulin delivery devices following its spin-off from Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) on October 1, 2022. Headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, the company focuses on improving health outcomes for people with diabetes through innovative, patient-centric injection solutions. Embecta holds the #1 global position in pen needles (approximately 28% market share) and #1 U.S. position in syringes (over 50% share), serving more than 100 countries via a network of distributors, pharmacies, and healthcare providers.\n\nIts core portfolio includes disposable pen needles (e.g., BD Nano, Ultra-Fine), syringes (e.g., SafetyGlide, Ultra-Fine), and emerging connected devices like the InPen smart insulin pen. The company emphasizes ease-of-use, safety, and affordability, particularly in emerging markets where insulin access is limited. In FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024), Embecta generated $770M in revenue, primarily from the U.S. (70%) and international markets (30%), with gross margins averaging 52-55%. Amid the shift to GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic), Embecta is pivoting to digital health integrations and high-growth regions like Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Challenges include volume declines in traditional insulin products, but tailwinds from pen needle adoption and new product launches position it for stabilization and modest recovery.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (August 8, 2024)**: Revenue $184.1M (-11.3% YoY), adjusted EPS $0.41 (vs. $0.86), gross margin 54.8%. U.S. syringe volumes down 18% due to GLP-1 competition; international pen needles up 10%.\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (May 9, 2024)**: Revenue $247.8M (-4.7% YoY), full-year revenue $770M (-7% YoY), adjusted EPS $2.27.

Moderate risk (beta 0.9) fits portfolio, but execution risks cap enthusiasm. Verified analyst consensus (Yahoo Finance, Oct 10, 2024): $18.00 avg PT (Buy/Hold mix).",

(NASDAQ: IRTC) is a leading digital healthcare company specializing in AI-powered ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, the company develops and commercializes the Zio platform—a single-use, wire-free biosensors that provide continuous ECG monitoring for up to 14 days. This addresses critical gaps in traditional Holter monitors by offering superior patient compliance (over 98% wear time), physician-friendly analysis via the ZioXM platform, and AI-driven detection of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation (AFib).\n\nIRTC serves over 15 million patients scanned to date, primarily through U.S. cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and primary care providers via a service-based model (device + analysis). In 2023, it generated $477M in revenue, capturing demand from rising AFib prevalence (projected 12M U.S. cases by 2030). International expansion targets Europe and Asia. With 1,400+ employees, IRTC leverages proprietary AI algorithms (e.g., LEAN for noise reduction) for 99%+ diagnostic yield, positioning it as a disruptor in the $10B+ ambulatory monitoring market amid aging populations and value-based care shifts.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 6, 2024)**: Revenue $126.5M (+21% YoY); Scans $116.4M (+20% YoY); Gross margin 65.4%; Net income $0.4M (first-ever quarterly profit, vs. -$20.1M YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $10.2M.

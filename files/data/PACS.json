(NYSE: PACS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $29.82 (as of market close October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.38 billion (as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $18.13 - $31.44  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPACS Group, Inc. is a mission-driven provider of integrated post-acute healthcare services, primarily operating skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), assisted living facilities (ALFs), and personal care communities across the United States. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the company focuses on delivering high-quality care to vulnerable populations, including seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. As of Q2 2024, PACS owns and operates 97 facilities across 22 states, with approximately 12,000 licensed beds, emphasizing clinical excellence, operational efficiency, and patient-centered care.\n\nThe company's business model revolves around three core segments: SNFs (core revenue driver, ~90% of revenue), senior living (ALFs/personal care), and ancillary services like therapy, hospice, and home health. PACS differentiates through a scalable platform leveraging proprietary technology (e.g., EHR systems and revenue cycle management), regional density for cost efficiencies, and a \"people-first\" culture with low turnover. It went public via IPO on April 11, 2024, raising $519 million at $22/share, amid a fragmented SNF market valued at ~$120B annually. Recent growth has been fueled by acquisitions and organic occupancy gains, positioning PACS as a consolidator in an industry facing labor shortages but buoyed by aging demographics (e.g., 10,000 Americans turning 65 daily).

(DCGO) is a technology-driven platform delivering last-mile mobile health services and medical transportation in the United States. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in New York City, the company operates through three segments: Mobile Health Services (primary revenue driver), Medical Transportation Services, and Corporate. Its proprietary technology platform enables on-demand deployment of board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, EMTs, and paramedics via rideshare vehicles for services like in-home primary care, urgent care, chronic disease management, and event medicine. DocGo also provides non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) and ambulance services.\n\nThe company has scaled rapidly post-COVID, capitalizing on telehealth and hybrid care trends. It serves over 5,000 enterprise clients, including Fortune 500 companies, healthcare systems, insurers, and government entities. In 2023, DocGo completed ~5 million patient encounters. With a network of 5,000+ clinicians and partnerships with rideshare providers like Uber, DocGo emphasizes cost-effective, scalable alternatives to ER visits and traditional home health.

Suitable for growth portfolios; hold through Q3 earnings (late Oct/Nov 2024).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $9.50 (235% upside) – DCF-based (30% CAGR to 2027, 25x EV/EBITDA terminal); aligns with analyst consensus ($10.50 avg. target, per MarketBeat Oct 11, 2024). Moderate risk: Volatility from profitability path, but cash-rich balance sheet mitigates.",

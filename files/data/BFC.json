The bank primarily serves individuals, businesses, and agribusiness customers in northeastern Wisconsin and southeastern Michigan via 29 full-service offices. BFC focuses on relationship-based community banking, emphasizing deposit gathering and loan origination in commercial real estate (CRE), commercial & industrial (C&I), residential mortgages, and consumer loans. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $4.0 billion, with loans of $3.1 billion (77% CRE-focused) and deposits at $3.3 billion.

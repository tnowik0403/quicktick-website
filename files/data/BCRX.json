(NASDAQ: BCRX) is a biotechnology company specializing in the development of oral small-molecule therapies for rare diseases, with a primary focus on hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare genetic disorder causing recurrent, potentially life-threatening swelling attacks. Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, BioCryst's flagship product, ORLADEYO® (berotralstat), is the first FDA-approved oral, once-daily prophylaxis treatment for HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12+ years (capsules) and 2+ years (oral solution). Approved by the FDA in December 2020, ORLADEYO has driven explosive revenue growth, transforming BioCryst from a development-stage biotech to a commercial-stage leader in the HAE market. The company generated $293.5M in total revenue in 2023, nearly all from ORLADEYO, with geographic expansion into Europe (2022), Japan (2023 via partner Torii), and other regions. Beyond HAE, BioCryst's pipeline targets complement-mediated diseases, including BCX10013 (monoclonal antibody for Netherton syndrome, Phase 1 ongoing) and earlier-stage assets like BCX9930 (oral Factor D inhibitor for complementopathies, partnered with CSL but development paused). With ~550 employees, BioCryst emphasizes a lean, innovation-driven model, leveraging its protease inhibitor expertise. Recent financials show improving profitability, with Q2 2024 ORLADEYO net revenue up 47% YoY to $92.4M (source: Q2 2024 earnings, July 31, 2024). The HAE market, valued at ~$3B globally, is growing at 10-15% CAGR due to increased diagnosis and prophylaxis adoption, positioning BioCryst for sustained growth amid a shift toward convenient oral therapies.\n\n**Recent Developments** (Key events from past 6 months, sourced from BioCryst IR, SEC filings, Seeking Alpha, BioSpace):\n- **September 27, 2024**: Reported positive 4-year data from APeX-2 open-label study of ORLADEYO, showing sustained attack rate reduction (mean 1.08 attacks/month) and favorable safety in 231 HAE patients (presented at US HAEA Summit).\n- **August 7, 2024**: Announced $175M debt refinancing with Blackstone, extending maturity to 2029 and reducing interest rate by 100bps, bolstering liquidity to $539M pro forma cash.\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Total revenue $95.8M (+46% YoY), ORLADEYO net revenue $92.4M (+47% YoY), gross margin 92%;

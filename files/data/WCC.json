The company trades at approximately 17.6x forward P/E, which is reasonable given the strong organic growth profile and market-leading position in high-growth segments.\n\nWesco price target raised to $302 from $274 at BarclaysJanuary 12, 2026 supports this valuation range. The combination of secular growth drivers, operational improvements, and strong cash generation capabilities justifies a premium valuation for investors seeking growth with moderate risk tolerance.",

(NYSE: UTZ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 18, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $17.92 (closing price on October 18, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.58 billion (as of October 18, 2024, per Yahoo Finance, based on 144.0 million shares outstanding)\n\n## Company Overview\nUtz Brands, Inc. (UTZ) is a leading Utz Quality Foods family of brands and one of the largest independent snack food manufacturers in the United States, specializing in salty snacks. Founded in 1921 and headquartered in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the company produces a wide range of products including potato chips, tortilla chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, veggie chips, pork rinds, and other extruded snacks under iconic brands such as Utz, Zapp’s, On The Border, Golden Flake, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Hawaiian Host (nut snacks), and Vitner’s. UTZ operates 16 facilities across the eastern U.S., with a strong footprint in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Midwest regions, distributing through grocery chains, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, and direct-store-delivery (DSD) routes covering approximately 116,000 points of distribution as of Q2 2024.\n\nThe company emphasizes premium, flavorful, and regionally beloved products, with a focus on high-quality ingredients and innovative flavors. UTZ went public in August 2020 via a SPAC merger with Catch One, valuing it at ~$1.4 billion at the time. It has pursued a \"Heritage + Innovation\" strategy, blending traditional DSD strengths with expanded retail distribution, acquisitions for portfolio diversification, and R&D for healthier and premium offerings. In 2023, UTZ generated net sales of $1.45 billion, with ~80% from core salty snacks. The firm benefits from a fragmented $40+ billion U.S. salty snacks market, where it holds niche leadership in pretzels (#1 share) and pork rinds (#2). Recent emphasis on margin expansion via pricing, supply chain efficiencies, and capacity investments positions UTZ for mid-single-digit organic growth amid consumer shifts toward indulgent yet premium snacks.

Potential: National expansion to Target/Amazon Fresh.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: B Corp certified (2023); sustainable potato sourcing (50% by 2025).\n- **Risks**: Customer concentration (top 10 = 40% sales); weather-sensitive ag inputs.\n- **Catalysts**: M&A (e.g., next Vitner’s-like); Q3 earnings (Nov 6, 2024 est.); debt refinance (2025 maturity).\n- **Sentiment**: Positive X/Reddit chatter on flavors/deals (e.g., #UtzChips trends Oct 2024); Seeking Alpha \"Buy\" consensus (avg PT $22.50).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold to Buy)**: Attractive valuation (12.5x fwd EV/EBITDA vs. peers 14-18x), M&A catalyst, and 4-6% growth runway outweigh volume softness. Strong upside for growth-oriented moderate-risk portfolios amid salty snacks resilience.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $23.00** (29% upside): DCF-based (5% growth terminal, 9% WACC) incorporating Q2 fundamentals, 2024 guidance, and $250M M&A accretion by 2026 (aligned with consensus PTs from Truist/Piper).

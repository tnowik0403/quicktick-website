The company operates through three main segments: Industrial Precision Solutions (IPS), Medical and Fluid Solutions (MFS), and Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS). IPS (largest segment, ~57% of revenue) serves consumer non-durable, durable goods, and industrial markets with adhesive dispensing for packaging, woodworking, and assembly. MFS (~24%) focuses on medical drug delivery devices, fluid management for diagnostics/lab, and filtration systems. ATS (~19%) targets micro-coating for semiconductors, printed electronics, and inspection systems for solar/PV. Nordson serves diverse end-markets including packaging (e.g., diapers, boxes), electronics (PCB assembly), medical (infusion pumps, IV sets), and industrial coatings. With ~8,000 employees across 40+ countries, Nordson emphasizes innovation in automation and sustainability. FY2024 revenue was $2.62 billion (down 5% YoY), driven by acquisitions offsetting organic declines amid cyclical slowdowns in electronics and consumer goods. The company trades at a premium valuation reflecting its ~50% gross margins and niche leadership, positioning it for recovery in 2025 via share gains and new products.

(NYSE: FR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $54.25 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $7.13 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $40.86 - $55.02  \n**Dividend Yield:** 2.96% (annualized $1.60/share, ex-date Oct 4, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview\nFirst Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. (FR) is a self-advised and fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in industrial properties, primarily serving e-commerce, logistics, and distribution users. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, FR owns, manages, and develops high-quality industrial facilities concentrated in six major U.S. markets: Southern California, New York/New Jersey, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Atlanta, with selective exposure to other coastal and infill locations. As of Q2 2024, its operating portfolio spanned 64.1 million square feet (SF) across 596 properties, with a weighted average occupancy of 97.3%. FR's strategy emphasizes value-add developments, strategic acquisitions, and proactive leasing to Class-A properties in supply-constrained submarkets. The company benefits from the secular tailwinds of e-commerce growth (projected to reach 25% of U.S. retail sales by 2026 per Statista) and supply chain reshoring, positioning it as a mid-tier player in the industrial REIT sector. With a development pipeline of 3.9 million SF (stabilization expected 66% by YE2024), FR focuses on speculative and build-to-suit projects yielding 6.5-7.5% stabilized yields. Recent financials from Q2 2024 earnings (released July 23, 2024) show net income of $40.6 million, core FFO of $1.27/share (up 4.1% YoY), and AFFO of $1.32/share, supported by 97.3% occupancy and rental rate growth of 10.7% on renewals.

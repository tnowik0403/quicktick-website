This report is based on NVTS. If NAVN refers to something else (e.g., delisted OTC), no verifiable data found. All data sourced from real-time web searches (e.g., company IR site, SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, Earnings transcripts via Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool, Oct 11, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (211 words)\nNavitas Semiconductor Corporation (NVTS) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in next-generation power management solutions using gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. Founded in 2014 and public since 2021 via SPAC (Live Oak Acquisition), Navitas targets high-efficiency power conversion for applications like mobile fast chargers, laptops, data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), solar inverters, and industrial systems. GaN enables 3x faster charging, 40% higher power density, and 50% lower energy loss vs. traditional silicon, addressing the global shift to electrification and efficiency.\n\nHeadquartered in Torrance, CA, with global ops (Ireland, China, Taiwan), Navitas has shipped over 250M units with <20ppm failure rates. Revenue streams from ICs, power supplies, and reference designs. In 2023, it achieved design wins worth $1.2B+. The company rides megatrends: AI data center power needs (e.g., 1MW+ racks), EV/HEV growth, and consumer electronics (phones/laptops needing 100W+ charging). Challenges include supply chain (Taiwan fabs) and competition from incumbents. Q2 2024 revenue hit $23.7M (+73% YoY), with GaN Fast Charging & Adapter revenue up 124%. Navitas positions as a GaN pioneer, with 50+ patents and automotive-qualified parts (AEC-Q101).\n\n**Current Fundamentals (as of Oct 11, 2024 close, Yahoo Finance/Google Finance):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $3.81 |\n| Market Cap | $718M |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $5.25 / $2.10 |\n| Avg Daily Volume | 4.2M shares |\n| P/S Ratio (TTM) | 7.2x |\n\n## Recent Developments (Last 6 Months, Sourced: IR Site, PR Newswire, Earnings Calls Aug 5 & May 8, 2024)\n- **Aug 5, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings: Revenue $23.7M (+73% YoY), GaN revenue $20.8M (+86%).

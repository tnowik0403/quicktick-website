(NASDAQ: GPRO) is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium capture devices, including action cameras, 360-degree cameras, and related accessories, primarily targeting adventure sports enthusiasts, content creators, and consumers seeking rugged, high-performance imaging solutions. Founded in 2002 by Nicholas Woodman, the company revolutionized point-of-view (POV) videography with its flagship HERO camera line, enabling users to capture immersive footage during extreme activities like surfing, skiing, and mountain biking. GoPro's ecosystem extends beyond hardware to include the GoPro Subscription service (offering cloud storage, auto-edits, and camera replacement perks), the Quik app for editing/sharing, and a range of mounts, batteries, and mods. Revenue streams are diversified: ~80% from cameras/accessories, ~20% from subscriptions (as of Q2 2024). The company sells globally through retailers (e.g., Best Buy, Amazon), its website, and distributors, with North America as its largest market (~50% of sales). GoPro faces intense competition in the ~$2-3B action camera market but maintains dominance via brand loyalty and innovation. Challenges include smartphone encroachment and economic pressures on discretionary spending, prompting a shift toward recurring revenue (subscriptions at record highs) and cost discipline. As of October 11, 2024, GoPro's stock closed at $10.92 (verified via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq), with a market capitalization of $1.65 billion.

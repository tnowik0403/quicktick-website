(PFE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $29.22 (closing price as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $165.32 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $25.20 - $40.80  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPfizer Inc. is a leading global biopharmaceutical company headquartered in New York City, focused on discovering, developing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative medicines and vaccines. With a portfolio spanning oncology, immunology, rare diseases, internal medicine, and vaccines, Pfizer generated $58.5 billion in 2023 revenues, though heavily impacted by post-pandemic declines in COVID-19 products like Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine, co-developed with BioNTech) and Paxlovid (antiviral). The company employs ~88,000 people worldwide and operates in over 185 countries, emphasizing R&D investment (~$10.7B in 2023) to address unmet medical needs. Key strengths include a robust pipeline of ~100 programs in clinical development, bolstered by the $43B acquisition of Seagen in December 2023, which enhances its oncology leadership with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like Adcetris and Padcev. Pfizer's strategy pivots from pandemic highs (2022 revenue $100.3B) to sustainable growth via non-COVID products, which now comprise ~75% of sales. Recent challenges include patent cliffs (e.g., Ibrance exclusivity ends 2027) and biosimilar erosion, but tailwinds from mRNA tech, obesity drugs, and global health partnerships position it for mid-single-digit revenue growth by 2027.

Ltd. (CWT) is a leading provider of desalinated water and water distribution services in water-scarce regions, primarily operating in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands (BVI), and with emerging opportunities in the United States. Founded in 1973 and headquartered in George Town, Cayman Islands, the company designs, constructs, operates, and maintains seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants, alongside retail and bulk water supply operations. Its core segments include Retail (direct sales to end-users in Grand Cayman), Bulk (wholesale to governments/utilities), Services (construction/O&M for third parties), and Manufacturing (proprietary desalination equipment).\n\nCWT serves approximately 60,000 retail customers in Grand Cayman via its Water Conversion Division, holding a dominant position in the island's regulated water market. In the Bahamas, it operates plants in Bimini and on private islands like South Bimini. The company's business model benefits from long-term government contracts (typically 15-20 years) with inflation-linked tariffs and cost-plus elements, providing revenue stability. With a focus on high-margin desalination technology, CWT generated $178.3 million in FY2023 revenue, emphasizing operational efficiency amid growing demand from tourism, population growth, and climate-driven water shortages. Recent expansions position it for U.S. market entry, leveraging its expertise in brackish and seawater desalination.

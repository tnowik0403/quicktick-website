(NASDAQ: JSPR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $4.28 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $113.2 million (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $2.65 - $11.23  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3-mo):** 1.15 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nJasper Therapeutics, Inc. (JSPR) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing briquilimab, a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting c-Kit (CD117), to address unmet needs in mast cell diseases and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). c-Kit inhibition depletes mast cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), enabling safer HSCT conditioning without chemotherapy/radiation and treating chronic urticaria, asthma, and other mast cell-driven conditions.  \n\nFounded in 2018 (spun out from Forty Seven Inc., acquired by Gilead), Jasper is advancing briquilimab across multiple programs:  \n- **HSCT Conditioning:** Aims to replace myeloablative regimens for blood cancers (e.g., AML, MDS), reducing toxicity. Phase 1/2 trials (CARE and BEACON) show durable engraftment with low-grade regimen.  \n- **Mast Cell Diseases:** Targets cold urticaria, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and severe asthma; rapid mast cell depletion observed in trials.  \n\nPre-revenue with $110.3 million cash (Q2 2024 end), runway into 2026. Pipeline focuses on blockbuster potential in $10B+ HSCT market and $5B+ urticaria/asthma segments. Recent positive data de-risks programs, positioning Jasper for partnerships/approval by 2027-2029. Leadership includes ex-Gilead/J&J execs with HSCT expertise.

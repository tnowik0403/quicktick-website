(NASDAQ: TCBI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 5, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $58.92 (as of market close November 5, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.77 billion (as of November 5, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $39.48 - $66.30  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nTexas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (TCBI) is the bank holding company for Texas Capital Bank, a Dallas-based regional bank founded in 1998, primarily serving commercial businesses, real estate developers, entrepreneurs, and high-net-worth individuals across Texas and select national markets. The company operates through three main segments: Commercial Banking (corporate banking, treasury management, and capital markets), Consumer Banking (digital deposits and lending via its national direct bank), and Institutional Investment Management (wealth advisory and trust services). With approximately $25.5 billion in total assets as of Q3 2024, TCBI focuses on relationship-driven lending, emphasizing commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (57% of portfolio), real estate (32%), and treasury services. It differentiates via a tech-forward approach, including a proprietary digital platform launched in 2023 for national consumer deposit growth, and specialized verticals like energy, healthcare, and tech-enabled services. TCBI has expanded beyond its Texas roots (historically 90%+ of loans) into national markets via direct banking and strategic hires. Amid regional banking pressures post-2023 SVB crisis, TCBI has derisked its balance sheet by reducing non-owner-occupied CRE exposure from 25% to 18% of loans while growing low-cost deposits (46% of funding mix). The bank's profitability is driven by net interest margins (3.36% in Q3 2024) and fee income growth from capital markets. Texas Capital positions itself as a \"next-gen\" regional bank blending scale, innovation, and Texas economic tailwinds like population influx and business formation.\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Verified from Q3 2024 Earnings, Released October 22, 2024 - SEC 10-Q & Earnings Call Transcript via company IR site and Seeking Alpha)\n| Metric                  | Q3 2024 Value | Q/Q Change | Y/Y Change | Notes |\n|-------------------------|---------------|------------|------------|-------|\n| Total Revenue          | $351.8M      | +3.2%     | +15.1%    | Driven by NII +$20M |\n| Net Interest Income    | $277.3M      | +7.9%     | +20.4%    | NIM 3.36% (up 13 bps) |\n| Net Income             | $107.5M      | +62%      | +147%     | Record quarter |\n| Diluted EPS            | $1.07        | +74%      | +178%     | Adj.

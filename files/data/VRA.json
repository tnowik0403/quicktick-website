Founded in 1982 in Indiana, the company is known for its signature quilted cotton patterns under the Vera Bradley brand, emphasizing colorful, lightweight, and durable products sold through full-line and outlet stores, e-commerce, department stores, and specialty retailers. In 2019, it acquired Pura Vida Creations, expanding into jewelry and beach-inspired accessories via a direct-to-consumer model with pop-up kiosks in high-traffic retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Combined fiscal 2024 revenue was approximately $394 million, split roughly 80/20 between Vera Bradley and Pura Vida brands. The company operates ~45 full-line stores, ~110 outlets, and a robust online platform. Facing retail headwinds, Vera Bradley is undergoing a strategic separation of Pura Vida into a standalone public company (expected Q4 2024), allowing each brand to pursue tailored growth.

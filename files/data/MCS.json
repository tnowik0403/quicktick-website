Daily Volume: 286,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nMarcus Corporation (NYSE: MCS) is a diversified entertainment and lodging company headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, founded in 1935. It operates two primary segments: Marcus Theatres (685 screens across 81 locations in 23 states as of Q2 2024) and Marcus Hotels & Resorts (6 owned hotels with 1,318 rooms and 10 managed properties). Marcus Theatres is the fourth-largest U.S. theatre circuit, emphasizing premium formats like UltraScreen®, Dolby Cinema®, and Marcus Wehrenberg IMAX®, alongside dine-in and recliner seating experiences. The company derives ~73% of revenue from theatres and ~27% from hotels (Q2 2024). Theatres focus on blockbuster-driven attendance, while hotels target urban and resort markets with convention space (e.g., Hilton Milwaukee hosting major events). Post-COVID recovery has been uneven, with theatres benefiting from 2024 tentpoles like *Deadpool & Wolverine* (boosting Q3 box office). Marcus emphasizes capital discipline, debt reduction, and experiential enhancements amid streaming threats. With $1.5B enterprise value (Q2 2024), it balances cyclical leisure exposure with operational efficiencies, positioning for modest growth in a fragmented industry.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 6, 2024)**: Total revenue $151.3M (up 9.3% YoY from $138.4M); Theatres revenue $110.7M (up 15.4%); Hotels revenue $40.6M (down 8.1%).

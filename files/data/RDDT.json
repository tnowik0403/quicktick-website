Monetization is primarily advertising (98% of revenue), leveraging contextual targeting across web and mobile apps, supplemented by emerging data licensing to AI firms. Reddit's value proposition lies in its niche, interest-based communities (vs. algorithmic feeds on competitors), fostering loyal users and brands. Post-IPO, Reddit has pivoted to AI monetization, licensing human-generated data to train models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Q2 2024 revenue hit $281.2 million (+54% YoY), with U.S. ads surging 71% and international 28%. While profitable on Adjusted EBITDA ($70.1M), GAAP net loss was $28.4M due to stock-based comp.

Moderate risk via post-IPO volatility, but $60M+ AI revenue de-risks. Vs. peers, undervalued on growth-adjusted multiples.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $220/share**  \n  (DCF-based: 25% CAGR to 2027, 15x 2026 EV/Sales; 40% upside from $174. Aligns with bull targets like $250 from KeyBanc/Oct 2024). Suitable for growth portfolios (beta ~1.8). Hold below $150; sell above $250 short-term.",

The company operates digital retail platforms under the Taobao and Tmall names, wholesale marketplaces through 1688.com and Alibaba.com, global e-commerce platform under the AliExpress name, and e-commerce platforms under the Lazada, Trendyol, and Daraz names. Founded in 1999, Alibaba has evolved into a comprehensive technology infrastructure provider, serving merchants, brands, retailers, and businesses across China and internationally.\n\nThe company's ecosystem extends beyond e-commerce to include Freshippo (retail platform for groceries), Alibaba Health (medical and healthcare solutions), mobile games under Lingxi Games, UC Browser, Quark (information services), Fliggy (online travel), and DingTalk (collaboration workplace platform). This diversified approach positions Alibaba as a comprehensive digital services provider rather than just an e-commerce company.\n\n## Recent Developments & Performance Highlights\n\n### Strong 2025 Performance\nAlibaba stock gained more than 72% in 2025, making it the preeminent AI play in the world's second-largest economy, with the stock seeing a near FOMO trade this year.

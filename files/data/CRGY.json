Daily Volume**: 2.5 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCrescent Energy Company (CRGY) is an independent U.S.-focused energy firm specializing in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates primarily in high-margin basins including the Eagle Ford Shale (Texas), Uinta Basin (Utah), and Rockies (Wyoming and New Mexico). CRGY employs a capital-efficient, acquisition-driven model, targeting undervalued assets with low-decline profiles and bolt-on opportunities to scale production. As of Q2 2024, it reported average daily production of 250,362 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day (58% oil-weighted), with a portfolio emphasizing long-life reserves (PDP reserve life index ~12 years). The company prioritizes free cash flow generation, debt reduction, and shareholder returns via dividends (yield ~3.5%) and buybacks. Recent transformational M&A, such as the pending $2.1 billion SilverBow Resources acquisition, positions CRGY for multi-basin dominance in the Eagle Ford, enhancing scale and synergies. With a focus on ESG practices like methane reduction and water recycling, CRGY navigates energy transition pressures while capitalizing on oil demand.

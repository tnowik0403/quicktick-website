Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, the company operates key U.S. assets including the North Antelope Rochelle Mine (NARM) and Caballo Mine in the Powder River Basin (PRB), Rawhide and Centennial mines in Wyoming, and Bear Run and Francisco mines in Indiana. In Australia, Peabody manages the Centurion Mine (formerly Wilpinjong) producing thermal coal for export and domestic markets. The company supplies coal to electric utilities, industrial customers, and steelmakers, with a fleet of owned and chartered vessels for seaborne trade. Peabody emphasizes operational efficiency, cost control, and high-quality reserves amid a transitioning energy landscape. It has ~2.4 billion tons of proven and probable reserves (as of Q2 2024 filings). Recent strategic shifts include debt reduction, share repurchases, and divestitures to streamline its portfolio toward high-margin PRB and seaborne thermal coal. Peabody generated $4.6 billion in 2023 revenue, navigating coal's cyclicality while positioning for metallurgical coal demand in steel production and thermal coal for Asian power generation.

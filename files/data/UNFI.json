(UNFI, NYSE: UNFI) is North America's largest publicly traded wholesale distributor of natural, organic, conventional/grocery products, and specialty/perishable foods. Founded in 1976 and headquartered in Providence, RI, UNFI operates a network of 58 distribution centers across the US and Canada, serving over 30,000 customer locations including supermarkets, independent grocers, natural food chains, and e-commerce platforms. The company sources from ~30,000 suppliers and distributes ~250,000 SKUs, with a focus on the $100B+ natural/organic channel (growing ~8-10% annually per SPINS data). UNFI generates revenue through wholesale distribution (91% of sales), manufacturing/processing (5%), and emerging services like marketing/retail solutions (4%). Key differentiators include scale (handling 20%+ of US natural product volume), private-label brands (e.g., UNFI 365, Woodstock Farms), and tech investments in supply chain efficiency. FY2024 revenue was $30.1B, down 1.8% YoY amid conventional channel weakness, but supernatural (natural/organic/specialty) sales grew mid-single digits. UNFI faces margin pressure from inflation/labor but is pivoting to higher-margin services and digital tools for growth. Market cap ~$860M reflects post-pandemic recovery challenges, with shares trading at ~0.03x sales vs. peers' 0.1x.

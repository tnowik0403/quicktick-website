Founded in 1980 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company operates over 70 facilities worldwide, employing approximately 34,000 people. Sanmina's offerings span the product life cycle, including new product introduction (NPI), prototyping, supply chain management, and aftermarket services.\n\nThe business is divided into two segments:  \n- **Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS)** (~90% of revenue): Focuses on PCB assembly, box builds, systems integration for communications networks (5G/Cloud), medical devices, aerospace/defense, and industrial markets.  \n- **Components, Products & Services (CPS)** (~10%): Produces subsystems like optical, RF/ microwave modules, storage systems, and LED lighting.\n\nSanmina serves high-reliability sectors requiring complex, low-volume/high-mix production. In FY2024 (ended Sep 29, 2024), it reported revenue of $8.9B (down 15% YoY), driven by inventory corrections in semiconductors and cloud computing. The company emphasizes sustainability (e.g., 100% renewable energy goal by 2030) and advanced tech like AI-driven manufacturing. With a focus on defense, medical, and hyperscale cloud, Sanmina positions itself for secular growth in megatrends like 5G, AI data centers, and electrification.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Reported Oct 7, 2024, for quarter ended Sep 29, 2024)**: Revenue $2.0B (flat YoY); GAAP net income $45.2M ($0.78/share); Non-GAAP EPS $1.45 (beat estimates by $0.11). Gross margin 9.7% (up 50bps YoY). IMS revenue $1.9B (+3% QoQ); CPS $121M. Book-to-bill 1.04x. FY2025 guidance: Revenue $7.9-8.3B; Non-GAAP EPS $6.00-6.80 (Source: Earnings release & transcript via Seeking Alpha/IR site).\n- **Sep 2024**: Announced $50M investment in U.S. manufacturing expansion for defense/aerospace (Sanmina press release, Sep 12).\n- **Aug 2024**: Won multi-year contract for 5G radio units with a Tier-1 telecom OEM (unnamed, per earnings call).\n- **Jul 2024**: Q3 FY2024 earnings (ended Jun 29): Revenue $1.9B (-14% YoY); Non-GAAP EPS $1.37; reaffirmed defense/medical growth outlook.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: Diversify into high-margin, secular markets (defense up 25% YoY in FY24; medical/devices growing 10-15%); invest in U.S./Mexico capacity for nearshoring; leverage NPI expertise for AI/edge computing wins.\n- **FY2025 Focus**: Target 5-10% organic growth via hyperscale cloud (e.g., storage subsystems), 5G infrastructure, and DoD programs. Expand CPS margins to 12-15% through RF/optics scale.\n- **Capital Allocation**: $100M+ CapEx in FY25 for automation/AI; $200M share repurchases authorized (30% of market cap); dividend yield ~0.4%.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category       | Headwinds                                                                 | Tailwinds                                                                 |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company**   | Inventory digestion in semis/cloud (ongoing into H1 FY25); CPS weakness (-20% YoY); customer concentration (top 10 clients ~50% revenue). | Strong defense backlog (+$1B, up 20%); medical NPI pipeline; U.S. reshoring tailwinds. |\n| **Sector (EMS)** | Cyclicality in consumer/enterprise IT; China trade tensions; labor shortages. | AI data center boom (hyperscalers); 5G/DoD spending ($100B+ U.S. defense budget); medtech growth (8% CAGR to 2030). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **IMS**: PCBAs, enclosures, systems for 5G base stations, servers, medical imaging (CT/MRI), defense radars.\n- **CPS**: RF/microwave assemblies, optical transceivers, SSD storage systems, precision machining.\n- Key Markets: Communications (30%), Medical (25%), Defense/Aero (20%), Multimedia/Cloud (15%), Industrial/Auto (10%).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **AI/Edge Computing**: Developing liquid-cooled rack solutions for hyperscalers (sampling Q4 2024, per Oct earnings call).\n- **Defense**: Next-gen secure comms modules under U.S. Army contract (production ramp H1 2025).\n- **Medical**: Wearables and diagnostics platforms with two new OEM wins (announced Q3 FY24).\n- **Sustainability**: \"Green Manufacturing\" initiative with recyclable PCBs (pilot Oct 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Global EMS Market (~$600B in 2024)**: Sanmina ~1.5% share (Statista/Prismark estimates; peers dominate with Flex ~5%, Jabil ~4%).\n- **Sub-Markets**: Defense EMS ~3-4% (strong in U.S.); Medical Devices EMS ~2%; Cloud Storage ~1%.\n- **Forecast**: Market share stable-to-up 10-20bps to 1.7% by 2026, driven by defense/medical outpacing industry 5% CAGR.

Rationale: Undervalued at 8x FY25 EPS ($6.40 midpoint); defense/medical resilience offsets cyclicality; 20-30% upside potential in AI/5G ramp. Moderate risk via diversification (low beta 1.1).\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: $90 (25% upside from $72.25). Based on 14x FY25 Non-GAAP EPS (peer avg premium for margins) + DCF (8% WACC, 5% terminal growth). Hold if below $65; trim above $100.",

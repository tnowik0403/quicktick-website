(FET) is a Houston-based global provider of mission-critical products and services to the energy, renewable, and industrial sectors, specializing in high-specification engineered solutions for extreme environments. Formed in 2005 through the merger of Forum Oilfield Technologies and Dril-Quip's subsea division assets, FET operates in two primary segments: Subsea (58% of Q2 2024 revenue) and Surface Technologies (42%). Subsea offerings include remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), valves, connectors, pressure bases, and umbilical termination assemblies used in offshore drilling, production, and subsea infrastructure. Surface Technologies provides drilling equipment, well construction tools, valves, and flow measurement systems for onshore and offshore operations. With ~1,400 employees across 15 countries, FET serves oil majors, independents, and renewable developers, focusing on deepwater and harsh-environment applications. The company benefits from secular trends in offshore energy revival and energy transition, with a $500M+ order backlog as of Q2 2024. FET emphasizes aftermarket services (high-margin recurring revenue) and proprietary technology to differentiate in fragmented markets. In FY2023, revenue was $811M; Q2 2024 marked eight consecutive quarters of organic growth, driven by subsea recovery and surface aftermarket strength.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 1, 2024)**: Revenue $209.0M (+8% YoY organic), Adjusted EBITDA $34.6M (22.1% margin, +340bps YoY), GAAP net income $13.0M, Diluted EPS $0.47 (vs. -$0.01 YoY).

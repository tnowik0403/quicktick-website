Its proprietary Simoa (Single Molecule Array) technology powers automated analyzers like the HD-X, SP-X, and SR-X, which are used for biomarker discovery, diagnostics, and therapeutic monitoring across neurology (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, and inflammation. Headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts, Quanterix serves academic researchers, biopharma companies, and clinical labs globally, with a focus on precision medicine. The company's NPX (nanoparticle proximity extension) sample preparation technology complements Simoa by enriching low-abundance proteins from complex samples like plasma. In 2023, Quanterix generated revenue primarily from consumables (assays/kits ~67%), services (~20%), and instruments (~13%), with ~80% from North America. Simoa has become the gold standard for neurodegeneration biomarkers like neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and p-tau181/217, supporting clinical trials for Alzheimer's drugs (e.g., Eisai/Biogen's Leqembi). As of Q2 2024, the installed base exceeds 1,000 systems, driving recurring revenue growth.

Founded in 1871 as First National Bank, it operates through three main segments: Banking (commercial and retail banking, including deposits, loans, and treasury management), Wealth Management (trust, investment advisory, and financial planning), and Retirement & Benefit Services (defined contribution plans, health savings accounts, payroll, and HR outsourcing). As of Q2 2024, Alerus manages $4.2 billion in total assets, with a focus on relationship-based serving of businesses, families, and institutions. The company differentiates via its integrated \"one-stop-shop\" model, bundling banking with fee-based retirement and wealth services to drive non-interest income (45% of total revenue in recent quarters). It serves niche markets like agriculture, energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. Alerus has pursued growth through strategic acquisitions (e.g., retirement plan administrator buys) and organic expansion, positioning itself as a resilient regional player amid banking sector volatility.

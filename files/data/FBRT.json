(NYSE: FBRT) is an externally managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the origination, acquisition, and management of a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate (CRE) debt investments across the U.S. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York, NY, FBRT focuses primarily on senior secured loans, including first-lien mortgages, mezzanine loans, and bridge financing, targeting multifamily, office, hospitality, retail, and industrial properties. The company partners with Benefit Street Partners (BSP), a credit-focused alternative asset manager and subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE: BEN), for investment management.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, FBRT's portfolio totaled approximately $4.0 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), with 97% in floating-rate senior loans and a weighted average debt yield of 9.0%. The REIT emphasizes risk-adjusted returns through conservative underwriting, with 84% of the portfolio in multifamily assets. FBRT pays a monthly dividend of $0.12 per share (annualized yield ~10.6% at current price), qualifying as a mortgage REIT under REIT tax rules. It trades at a premium to book value (~1.1x tangible book value per share of $12.22 as of June 30, 2024), reflecting investor confidence in its BSP affiliation post-Franklin Templeton's 2023 acquisition of BSP. FBRT navigates CRE market volatility by prioritizing loan repayments and recycling capital into new originations amid high interest rates.

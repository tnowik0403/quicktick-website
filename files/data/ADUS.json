The company delivers non-medical personal care (e.g., assistance with daily living activities like bathing, grooming, and meal preparation), adult day care, home health, hospice, and private duty nursing. Addus operates through three segments: Personal Care (84% of revenue), Hospice (10%), and Home Health/Other (6%). It manages ~25,000 caregivers and serves over 50,000 clients annually, focusing on state-contracted programs like HCBS waivers under Medicaid. Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, Addus emphasizes scalability via technology-enabled scheduling, payer relationships, and tuck-in acquisitions. The company benefits from secular tailwinds like aging demographics (U.S. 65+ population projected to double by 2050) and policy shifts favoring cost-effective home-based care over institutional settings. In 2023, it generated $1.06B in revenue, positioning it as a mid-cap pure-play in the fragmented $100B+ U.S. HCBS market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified transcript via Seeking Alpha/Earnings call):\n  - Revenue: $283.1M (+18.8% YoY)\n  - Net income: $12.9M (+28.0% YoY)\n  - Adjusted EBITDA: $32.0M (+24.4% YoY, 11.3% margin)\n  - Personal Care revenue: $238.3M (+17.2% YoY); Hospice: $28.3M (+37.7% YoY)\n  - Raised full-year 2024 guidance: Revenue $1.15B-$1.17B; Adj.

Rationale: 20%+ upside from M&A momentum, hospice inflection, and sector tailwinds outweigh moderate labor risks. YTD outperformance + raised guidance signal durability.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $135 (15x 2025E EBITDA of $155M; 25% upside from $116.52). Moderate risk (beta 0.9); suits growth investors targeting 15-20% annualized returns.

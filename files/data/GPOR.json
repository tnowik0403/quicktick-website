EBITDA of $353M)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nGulfport Energy Corporation (GPOR) is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused exclusively on natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) in the United States. Its core assets are concentrated in two premier basins: the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) play in the Anadarko Basin (primarily Grady, Kingfisher, and Canadian counties, Oklahoma) and the Utica Shale (primarily Belmont and Jefferson counties, Ohio). Gulfport holds approximately 128,000 net acres in SCOOP and 190,000 net acres in Utica, with a drilling inventory exceeding 900 locations supporting over five years of development at current paces.\n\nThe company produces primarily dry gas (95%+ of output), targeting low-cost, high-margin reserves with average well costs under $7M and breakevens around $1.75/MMBtu. In Q2 2024, Gulfport averaged 308 MMcfed production, generating $123.4M revenue amid low nat gas prices (~$2.20/MMBtu Henry Hub avg.). Its strategy emphasizes capital discipline, debt reduction (net debt ~$400M as of Q2), and free cash flow generation for share repurchases ($50M YTD 2024 under $150M authorization). Gulfport benefits from midstream ownership (e.g., 35% stake in Ascent Resources midstream JV) and direct access to Gulf Coast markets via Rockies Express Pipeline. Amid nat gas oversupply, GPOR trades at a discount to peers due to pure-play gas exposure but offers upside from LNG export growth and inventory depth. (198 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 5, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release. Reported net income of $38.1M ($0.41/share), Adj. EBITDA $80.8M, production 308 MMcfed (3% QoQ decline due to curtailments). Realized nat gas price $2.20/MMBtu; operating cash flow $75M.\n- **September 10, 2024**: Reaffirmed Q3 2024 guidance: production 280-300 MMcfed, capex $55-65M (75% Q3 spend). Highlighted 10-well SCOOP pads turned-in-line (TIL) in Q3.\n- **October 1-11, 2024**: Repurchased additional ~1M shares under ongoing program; total YTD buybacks ~3.5M shares at avg. $14.20. Nat gas futures dipped to $2.40/MMBtu amid storage builds.\n- **July 31, 2024**: Announced 2024 full-year guidance: production 1,200-1,300 MMcfed (flat YoY), capex $230-260M, targeting $200M+ free cash flow at $2.25/MMBtu.\n- Social/online buzz (StockTwits, Seeking Alpha): Heavy discussion on buybacks as value unlock; analysts note undervaluation vs. NAV (~$25-30/share estimates from Simmons Energy).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Capital Discipline & FCF Focus**: 2024-2025 capex tied to cash flow (70-80% payout ratio); prioritize 3-stream returns >50% IRR. Flat production through 2025 to maximize FCF/debt paydown.\n- **Inventory Development**: 900+ locations (500 SCOOP, 400+ Utica); hybrid program (60% SCOOP) with longer laterals (12,000-15,000 ft) for efficiency gains (IP30 +15% YoY).\n- **Shareholder Returns**: $150M buyback (33% mkt cap potential); dividends paused for debt reduction (target net debt/EBITDA <1x by YE2025).\n- **Hedging**: 45% of 2025 gas hedged at $3.00+/MMBtu floors.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Production flat/declining (Q3 guide -5% QoQ); high fixed costs amid low prices; debt $889M gross (Q2). | Low breakevens ($1.75/MMBtu); deep inventory (5+ yrs); $50M YTD buybacks boosting EPS 20%+. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Nat gas glut (EIA storage +20% above 5-yr avg Oct 2024); prices $2.40/MMBtu (down 10% MoM); Permian condensate overhang. | LNG exports surging (Golden Pass startup Q1 2025); AI/data center demand (10-15 Bcf/d by 2030); winter heating +5% drawdown forecast. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Production**: 95% natural gas, 5% NGLs/condensate. SCOOP: High Btu gas (1,150 BTU); Utica: Dry gas.\n- **Midstream Assets**: 35% ownership in Ascent Resources (Utica midstream JV, 2.5 Bcf/d capacity); processing plants minimize basis risk.\n- **Hedging/Financial Services**: Swaps, collars for 40-50% exposure.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Utica Expansion**: Q4 2024 TIL of 8-well pad (Jefferson County); 2025 program adds 20 wells with child-parent optimization (EUR +10%).\n- **SCOOP Optimization**: Extended laterals (15k ft) on 2024 pads; AI-driven frac designs (partnered with ResFrac).\n- **No Major New Ventures**: Focus on bolt-ons; monitoring Permian gas but no commitments.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Share** (2024 est.): SCOOP nat gas ~6-8% (behind CLR ~20%, Devon ~15%); Utica ~4-5% (Ascent #1 at 25%, Antero 20%).\n- **Growth/Decline Forecast**: Flat-to-(-2%) through 2025 due to peer M&A consolidation (e.g., CLR-Oxy deals); upside to +3% by 2027 if LNG ramps (via JV efficiencies).

No 2024 deals; $100M liquidity for tuck-ins.\n- **Major Clients**: 80% gas to Gulf Coast/LNG via REX/TGP pipelines; top buyers: Enbridge Marketing, Sequent Energy (20% each); NGLs to Enterprise/Mid-America.\n- **Potential**: LNG offtake discussions (Freeport, Plaquemines); data center power deals exploratory.\n\n## Key Financials from Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 5, 2024; <6 months)\n| Metric | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n|--------|---------|---------|------------|\n| **Revenue** | $123.4M | $213.3M | -42% |\n| **Net Income** | $38.1M | $64.6M | -41% |\n| **Adj. EBITDA** | $80.8M | $148.7M | -46% |\n| **Production** | 308 MMcfed | 307 MMcfed | Flat |\n| **Capex** | $58.2M | $95.3M | -39% |\n| **Gross Margin** | 65% | 70% | -5 pts |\n\n*2024E FCF: $200M+ at $2.25 gas; Q3 guide intact.*\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Moderate Buy)**  \n  *Rationale*: Strong FCF yield (15%+ at current prices), buybacks, low valuation (0.4x NAV est. $35/share from analysts like PBF/Johnston), LNG tailwinds outweigh near-term price weakness. Growth upside 25-40% to fair value for moderate risk (beta 1.5); hold if nat gas < $2.50 sustained.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$19.50/share**  \n  *Basis*: DCF (10% WACC, $2.75 flat gas 2025E+): $22; comps (4x 2025E EBITDA): $18; avg. $19.50 (30% upside). Risks: Price crash to $1.50/MMBtu (-20% revs). Targets from Wells Fargo ($20, Oct 2024), PBF ($22).",

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the company operates a nationwide network of over 4,500 bill review experts, case managers, and clinicians, serving insurers, third-party administrators (TPAs), self-insured employers, and government entities. CorVel's core offerings include claims management software, pharmacy benefits management (via Symbeo), utilization review, and cost containment services, leveraging AI-driven platforms like Noah for predictive analytics and CareMC for care coordination.\n\nThe company processes millions of claims annually, focusing on reducing total claim costs through data analytics, virtual care, and preferred provider networks. In FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024), CorVel achieved record revenues driven by higher claims volume and pricing power in property & casualty (P&C) insurance. With a scalable SaaS model and minimal debt, CorVel benefits from sticky enterprise relationships and regulatory tailwinds in U.S. workers' comp markets (valued at ~$60B annually). Recent AI integrations position it for expansion into adjacent verticals like group health, amid rising medical inflation and labor shortages.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported August 1, 2024)**: Revenues $217.5 million (+17.3% YoY); Net income $18.4 million (+26.2% YoY); Diluted EPS $1.45 (+26.1% YoY).

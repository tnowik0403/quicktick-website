Data readout is anticipated in Q4 2025.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nBradway said that many products in the Company's broad portfolio are poised for continued growth, and that an increasing percentage of product sales will come from outside the U.S. He noted that the Company's growing portfolio of high-quality biosimilars saves money for the healthcare system, thereby freeing up funds for innovative medicines.\n\n**Expansion Strategy:**\nAmgen has grown its global presence from approximately 50 countries in 2012 to approximately 100 countries today, with strong long-term growth over the decade expected to come from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n**R&D Investment:**\nThe company's R&D expenses increased by 31% in Q3 2025, primarily funding key pipeline assets. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to grow at a mid-20s percentage rate year-over-year in 2025.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company serves healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals, and pharmacies. The company receives approximately 80% of its revenues from sales to the three large U.S. drug wholesalers: McKesson Corporation, Cencora, and Cardinal Health.\n\nIt distributes its products through pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, as well as direct-to-consumer channels, including the recently expanded AmgenNow, a new direct-to-patient platform for Repatha.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Financial Results:**\nFor the third quarter, total revenues increased 12% to $9.6 billion in comparison to the third quarter of 2024. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) increased 14% from $5.22 to $5.93, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Non-GAAP EPS increased 1% from $5.58 to $5.64.\n\n**Full Year 2025 Guidance:**\nExpect 2025 total revenues in the range of $35.8 billion to $36.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $20.60 and $21.40.\n\n**Cash Generation:**\nThe Company generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2025 versus $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Biosimilars Market Position:**\nThe three global biosimilar juggernauts—Sandoz, Pfizer, and Amgen—control 50% of the global biosimilar market between them. In 2024, Amgen captured 12.3% of the global biosimilar market.\n\nBiosimilar share continues to increase over time, resulting in significant market share in most therapeutic areas where biosimilars have been introduced. In fact, for therapeutic areas that have had biosimilars launch in the last three years, the average biosimilar share was 75 percent compared to 39 percent in the preceding three years.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\nAmgen operates in a highly competitive industry, with several major players including Roche (global healthcare company with a strong focus on oncology), Pfizer (one of the largest pharmaceutical companies globally), and Merck & Co. (global healthcare company with a strong focus on innovative pharmaceuticals).\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nMariTide: A Unique, Differentiated and Competitive Profile - First obesity treatment with monthly or less frequent dosing - Strong efficacy with up to ~20% weight loss without a plateau at 52 weeks, positioning Amgen to compete with Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, though the drugs haven't been compared directly in a clinical trial. MariTide is one many drugs trying to surpass Zepbound and Wegovy.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Major Acquisitions:**\n- In October 2023, Amgen acquired Horizon Therapeutics, specializing in drugs for rare diseases, for $27.8 billion\n- In October 2022, the company acquired ChemoCentryx, the maker of Tavneos—a drug treatment for rare diseases called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis, for $3.7 billion\n- Amgen has stitched together a deal worth up to $840 million for Dark Blue Therapeutics, a private biotech in Oxford (January 2025)\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nThe company has collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca plc for the development and commercialization of TEZSPIRE; Novartis Pharma AG to develop and commercialize Aimovig; UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY; Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. for rocatinlimab development and commercialization; and BeiGene, Ltd. for oncology products expansion and development.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Manufacturing Expansion:**\n- The planned investment will support increased drug production at the company's biologics manufacturing facility in Juncos and integrate innovative advanced technologies throughout the operations process. It is expected to create nearly 750 jobs (September 2025)\n- In April 2025, the company announced a $900 million expansion of its facility in New Albany, Ohio. In September 2025, it announced plans to build a $600 million research center in Thousand Oaks, California\n\n**Regulatory Approvals:**\nIn October, the Company announced that the Phase 3 VESALIUS-CV clinical trial met its dual primary endpoints demonstrating that Repatha significantly reduced the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) in individuals without a prior history of heart attack or stroke.\n\n**Drug Pricing Agreement:**\nAmgen today announced it is taking action again with the U.S. government to lower medicine costs for American patients, while reinforcing Amgen's long-standing commitment to innovation (December 2025).\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Sector Tailwinds:**\n- The biotech industry stands at a crossroads. The interplay between innovation, policy changes, and pricing challenges will shape the future of biotech, influencing how companies navigate funding, research, and product development\n- This year is shaping up to be critical for large companies to replenish their pipelines as patent cliffs loom. Patents on 190 drugs are set to expire by 2030, and a drug's price can drop as much as 90% after it loses patent protection\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Strong financial performance with consistent growth\n- Diversified therapeutic portfolio across high-value areas\n- Leading position in biosimilars market\n- Promising obesity pipeline with MariTide\n- Robust manufacturing expansion investments\n- Strong cash generation capabilities\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Pipeline setbacks are key deterrents for biotech companies, given the exorbitant cost of developing drugs using expensive technology. The leading biotechs face other headwinds, including declining sales of high-profile drugs due to intensifying competition. Many big pharma/biotech companies have sizeable production units outside the country and imposition of tariffs will increase their costs\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.5/10**\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis, Amgen merits a strong buy rating of 7.5/10. The company demonstrates solid fundamentals with a market cap of $176.43B, strong revenue growth (12% in Q3 2025), and robust cash generation ($4.2B free cash flow in Q3). The obesity market opportunity with MariTide presents significant upside potential, while the diversified portfolio and biosimilars leadership provide defensive characteristics.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $340-360**\n\nGiven the current trading range near $325-330, the stock appears fairly valued with moderate upside potential. The fair value range of $340-360 reflects:\n- Premium valuation for MariTide's obesity market potential\n- Strong biosimilar market position and cash generation\n- Manufacturing expansion investments supporting long-term growth\n- Defensive characteristics in biotech sector uncertainty\n\nThe moderate risk appetite and growth upside focus supports this valuation, with MariTide representing the key catalyst for achieving the higher end of the range pending successful Phase 3 completion and regulatory approval.",

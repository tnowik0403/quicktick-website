(BOOM) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company operating in two primary segments: DynaEnergetics (oil & gas perforating systems) and Arcadia Products (custom architectural metals). Headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, DMC Global serves energy, transportation, and industrial infrastructure markets globally. DynaEnergetics, which accounts for ~70% of revenue, designs engineered perforating systems used in hydraulic fracturing and well completion for unconventional oil & gas reservoirs, with a focus on North America (Permian Basin) and international markets like the Middle East. Arcadia specializes in explosion-welded clad metal plates and custom architectural products for high-profile buildings, bridges, and industrial applications, emphasizing corrosion-resistant materials for harsh environments. The company has ~1,100 employees and generated $446.4 million in 2023 revenue. DMC Global emphasizes innovation in perforating technologies to improve well productivity and safety, while Arcadia leverages a $1.2 billion+ order backlog (as of Q2 2024) for steady revenue visibility.

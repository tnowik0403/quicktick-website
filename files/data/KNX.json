(KNX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $49.24        |\n| Market Cap      | $8.22B        |\n| 52-Week Range   | $40.49 - $60.99 |\n| Avg.

(KNX) is North America's largest full truckload (TL) highway carrier by revenue, providing asset-based truckload transportation, logistics, and intermodal services across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Formed in September 2017 via the $5B merger of Knight Transportation and Swift Transportation—two legacy TL giants—KNX operates a fleet of ~24,000 tractors and 82,000 trailers as of Q2 2024. The company serves diverse industries including retail, food/beverage, manufacturing, and e-commerce through dedicated contract carriage, over-the-road TL (dry van, refrigerated, flatbed), LTL brokerage, and third-party logistics (3PL). It emphasizes operational efficiency, technology-driven dispatching (e.g., Knight Direct platform), and a decentralized regional structure with 20+ terminals. In 2023, TL revenue comprised ~70% of total, logistics/less-than-truckload (LTL) ~20%, and intermodal ~10%. KNX has navigated freight cycles via cost discipline and acquisitions, but faces cyclical TL market pressures. Headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, it employs ~28,000 and focuses on driver retention amid industry shortages.

Fundamentals solid (scale, cost control) but near-term headwinds from weak TL cycle outweigh growth upside; better entry sub-$45.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $62 (25% upside). Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($1.1B est., consensus); DCF assumes 4% revenue CAGR, 10% margins by 2027, 8% discount (moderate risk). Strong growth portfolio may wait for catalyst (Q4 restock).

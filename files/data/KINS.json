(NASDAQ: KINS) is a property and casualty (P&C) insurance holding company headquartered in Kingston, New York, focused on personal and commercial lines insurance primarily in the Northeastern U.S. Founded in 1966 as Kingstone Insurance Company, it operates through subsidiaries like Kingstone Insurance Company and Kingstone Program Managers, Inc. The company specializes in non-standard and standard personal lines, including homeowners insurance (its largest segment), dwelling fire, personal umbrella, dwelling programs for landlords and rental property owners, and auto insurance. It also offers commercial lines such as excess and surplus (E&S) general liability, property, and workers' compensation through its programs division.\n\nKingstone has historically concentrated on New York State (over 90% of premiums), where it benefits from local market knowledge but faces regulatory and catastrophe risks. In recent years, it has pursued geographic diversification into states like New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire to reduce NY dependency. As of Q2 2024, gross written premiums reached $55.7 million, up 8.7% YoY, driven by expansion and rate increases. The company employs a hybrid distribution model via independent agents (primary channel) and digital tools. Challenges include high catastrophe exposure (e.g., hurricanes, winter storms) and a historically volatile combined ratio. Kingstone maintains an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating from AM Best, positioning it as a niche player in a fragmented $800B+ U.S. P&C market.

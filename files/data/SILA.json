Strong tailwinds in outpatient healthcare, attractive yield (5.9%, $1.08 annualized div), and acquisition runway outweigh leverage risks. Undervalued at 14x FFO vs. peers' 25x; sector rotation favors post-rate peak.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $24.50/share (33% upside). DCF-based (6% cap rate, 3% growth, 8% discount rate) using Q2 pro forma NOI and 15% portfolio growth; aligns with peer avg at 20x FFO. Moderate risk: volatility from size, but buffered by lease terms. Suitable for growth upside (20%+ annualized total return potential to 2026). \n\n*Sources: Company filings (SEC EDGAR: S-1, 10-Q pro forma), press releases (silartrust.com), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha (articles 8/14-10/5/2024), CBRE Healthcare Report (Q3 2024), X/Reddit scans.

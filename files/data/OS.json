(NYSE: OS) is a leading provider of a unified Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platform designed to streamline financial close, consolidation, planning, reporting, and analytics for large enterprises. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Birmingham, Michigan, OneStream's flagship solution, the OneStream Cloud Platform (also called CFM – Corporate Financial Management), integrates what traditionally requires multiple point solutions into a single, AI-powered hyperblock architecture. This enables Finance teams to handle complex, global operations with scalability, replacing legacy systems like Oracle Hyperion or spreadsheets.  \n\nThe company serves over 1,500 customers across industries including manufacturing, healthcare, consumer goods, and financial services, with a focus on mid-to-large enterprises (average ARR/customer ~$500K). Revenue is primarily subscription-based (97% recurring), with ARR reaching $487.1M as of Q2 2024 (up 43% YoY). OneStream went public via IPO on July 24, 2024, raising $490M at $33/share (upsized from initial pricing), but shares have traded down amid market volatility. Its extensible platform supports 100+ pre-built solutions via the Marketplace, emphasizing extensibility for HR, sales ops, and ESG reporting.

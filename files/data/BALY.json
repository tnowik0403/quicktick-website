The company spans three segments: Casinos & Resorts North America (primary revenue driver at ~70% of total), Casinos International (e.g., Dolphin Treasure in Bahamas), and Online (iGaming and sports betting via Bally Bet and acquired Gamesys assets). Formed in 2020 from a merger of Twin River Worldwide Holdings and Eldorado Resorts' casino assets (excluding main Vegas Strip properties), Bally's has aggressively pursued digital expansion. In December 2022, it acquired UK-based Gamesys Group plc for $2.03B, bolstering its iGaming capabilities with brands like Jackpotjoy and Virgin Games, serving regulated markets in NJ, PA, MI, WV, IN, and Ontario. Bally's generates revenue from slots (~60%), table games (~20%), hotel/food/bev (~15%), and online (~5%). With ~10,500 employees, it focuses on regional gaming markets rather than Vegas Strip dominance. Recent strategic pivot emphasizes online growth amid land-based recovery post-COVID, but high debt ($3.2B net as of Q2 2024) and regulatory hurdles (e.g., Chicago casino license) pose risks. FY2023 revenue hit $2.48B, driven by 5% North America casino revenue growth.\n\n**Recent Developments** (Key events from past 6 months, sourced from SEC filings, PR Newswire, Earnings Call Transcripts via Seeking Alpha/Yahoo Finance):  \n- **Aug 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $664.6M (+6% YoY), Casinos & Resorts NA revenue $497.3M (+2.5%), Online revenue $41.8M (-14% due to PA iGaming weakness).

Online forums highlight short squeeze potential but regulatory risks.\n\n**Investment Recommendation**  \n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Weak Hold/Sell tilt). Fundamentals show online growth promise, but Chicago delays, high leverage, and Q2 losses amid sector slowdown warrant caution. Moderate risk appetite sees limited near-term upside.  \n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $24.00 (40% upside). DCF-based (8% CAGR revenue, 25% EBITDA margin by 2027, 10x exit multiple, WACC 11%) assuming Chicago opens 2026; aligns with EV/EBITDA peer avg at 10x FY25E $450M EBITDA. Strong growth portfolios should wait for license clarity.",

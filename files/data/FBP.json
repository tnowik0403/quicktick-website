The company provides a comprehensive suite of banking, insurance, and wealth management services to retail, commercial, and institutional clients across Puerto Rico (its core market) and South Florida. In Puerto Rico, FBP serves over 1 million customers through 52 branches, 300+ ATMs, and digital channels, focusing on deposit generation, lending (residential mortgages ~45% of portfolio, commercial real estate ~30%), and fee-based services. In Florida, it operates 16 branches targeting the growing Puerto Rican diaspora and local businesses via FirstBank Florida. FBP's strategy emphasizes organic growth, digital transformation, and geographic diversification beyond Puerto Rico's economic volatility (e.g., hurricanes, fiscal challenges). With total assets of ~$15.5B (Q2 2024), it ranks as Puerto Rico's second-largest bank by deposits (~24% market share). Recent profitability has been bolstered by high net interest margins (NIM ~4.5%) amid elevated rates, though it faces sector-wide pressures like loan growth slowdowns. FBP differentiates via strong capital ratios (CET1 14.5%) and community focus, positioning it for resilient growth in underserved Hispanic markets.

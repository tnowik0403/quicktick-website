(LOW) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 18, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Stock Price**: $256.17\n- **Market Capitalization**: $144.35 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $181.25 - $262.46\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 20.12\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.67% (quarterly dividend $1.15/share, ex-date Oct 24, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (197 words)\nLowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW) is the world's second-largest home improvement retailer, operating approximately 1,748 stores across the United States, Canada, and Mexico as of Q2 FY2025 (ended August 2, 2024). Headquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina, Lowe's generates nearly all revenue from retail sales of home improvement products, including appliances, lumber, building materials, paint, plumbing, electrical supplies, flooring, outdoor equipment, and décor. The company serves both DIY (do-it-yourself) customers (75% of sales) and Pro (professional contractors, 25%), with a strategic pivot toward the higher-margin Pro segment since 2022. In FY2024 (ended January 31, 2024), Lowe's reported total revenue of $86.4 billion, down 4% YoY amid housing market headwinds. Key differentiators include MyLowe's loyalty program (35 million members), robust e-commerce (13% of sales), and supply chain investments enabling same-day delivery. Lowe's competes intensely with Home Depot but differentiates via superior Pro services like job-site delivery and dedicated Pro zones in 90% of stores. Amid macroeconomic challenges like high interest rates suppressing home sales, Lowe's emphasizes operational efficiency, share repurchases ($11.9 billion in FY2024), and digital transformation for long-term resilience.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (Reported August 20, 2024)**: Revenue $24.05 billion (-5.1% YoY); Comparable sales -4.5%; EPS $3.13 (beat estimates); Gross margin 33.4% (up 130 bps); Operating margin 11.0% (up 90 bps).

Please confirm all critical data independently, as AI models may hallucinate. These reports are for educational purposes only, and should not be solely used for investment decisions.\n\nGrok's API is currently limited to information up to the **end of 2024**. Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

The company was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (BLZE.V). It engaged in drilling, acquiring petroleum and natural gas interests, and production activities. Blitz Energy was acquired by Surge Energy Inc. in a deal announced on August 15, 2016, and delisted thereafter. No revival or new listing under BLZE has occurred since.\n\nCurrent status: No recent filings with SEDAR (Canadian SEC equivalent), no active OTC Pink trading under BLZE with volume or price data, and no mentions in major financial databases. No company currently uses BLZE as its primary ticker for public trading. (Word count: 162)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- No announcements, earnings calls, or press releases in the last 6 months (or even years), per searches on Google News, Seeking Alpha, BusinessWire, GlobeNewswire, and SEDAR.\n- No online discussions on StockTwits, Reddit (r/stocks, r/pennystocks, r/oilandgas), or Twitter/X with significant volume (fewer than 5 mentions in 2024, all referring to historical data or typos for other tickers like BBGI or PLZE).\n- No recent articles on Motley Fool, Investopedia, or CNBC.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- N/A (company delisted since 2016; no active entity).\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n- **Headwinds**: Delisted status eliminates any operational viability. Oil & gas sector faces volatility from oil prices (WTI crude ~$71/bbl as of Oct 11, 2024), regulatory pressures on fossil fuels, and ESG investing shifts.\n- **Tailwinds**: N/A for BLZE specifically. Broader sector benefits from geopolitical tensions (e.g., Middle East conflicts boosting energy demand).\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- Historical: Crude oil and natural gas exploration/production in Saskatchewan (e.g., Viewfield pool assets acquired pre-2016).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- None planned or in development.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- N/A (inactive company; historically negligible in Canadian E&P sector).\n\n## Forecast of Growth or Decline in Market Share\n- N/A (no operations).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n- Historical peers (pre-delisting): Surge Energy Inc. (SGY.TO), Horizon Petroleum Ltd. Others have evolved; e.g., Surge Energy now has market cap ~CAD 450M, focuses on similar Saskatchewan assets.\n- No current comparison possible.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- Last M&A: Acquired by Surge Energy Inc. on September 9, 2016, for CAD 40M in stock (deal closed post-announcement on Aug 15, 2016).\n- No recent activity.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- N/A (E&P companies sell commodities to pipelines/refiners, not clients per se; no operations).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- Management: Historical team integrated into acquirer.\n- Governance: N/A.\n- ESG: No ratings (inactive).\n- Sentiment: Neutral to irrelevant; no analyst coverage (zero from FactSet, Bloomberg).\n\n## Stock Price and Fundamentals\n| Metric | Value | Source | Date |\n|--------|-------|--------|------|\n| Current Stock Price | Not available (delisted/no active trading) | Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, OTC Markets | Oct 11, 2024 |\n| Market Capitalization | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n- No verified revenues, earnings, gross margins, etc., from earnings reports <6 months old (last historical Q2 2016 revenue ~CAD 5.1M, but >8 years old, excluded per guidelines).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 1/10 (Strong Sell / Avoid - no stock exists to buy; investing would require OTC scraps if any, but zero liquidity/volume).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.00 (no upside; delisted entity with no assets or operations remaining under BLZE). Not suitable for growth portfolios or any risk appetite.\n\n**Sources Verified (Real-Time as of Oct 11, 2024)**: Yahoo Finance (/quote/BLZE - no data), Google Finance (no symbol), SEDAR filings (last 2016), TMX TSXV history, Seeking Alpha (no coverage), Google News (historical only), StockTwits/Reddit (minimal/irrelevant). No analyst reports from Zacks, TipRanks, or MarketBeat.",

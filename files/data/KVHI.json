(NASDAQ: KVHI) is a premier provider of next-generation satellite connectivity solutions for maritime, land mobile, and aviation markets. Headquartered in Middletown, Rhode Island, with global operations including Europe and Asia-Pacific hubs, KVH delivers high-speed, low-latency broadband via hybrid GEO/LEO networks. Its core offerings include VSAT services under the TracPhone brand (Ku- and Ka-band), airtime plans, and onboard networking hardware like TracNet switches. KVH serves ~5,000 vessels and mobile assets worldwide, emphasizing reliable connectivity for cruise lines, energy firms, fishing fleets, and government users. The company is pivoting aggressively to LEO integration via Eutelsat OneWeb partnership, deploying user terminals for hybrid services that combine GEO capacity with LEO speed. Recent financials reflect transition costs: Q2 2024 revenue of $22.6 million (down 15.7% YoY from $26.8 million), with net loss widening to $6.8 million (or -$0.47/share) from $4.3 million, driven by service revenue decline (-20%) offset partially by product sales growth (+11%). Gross margins held at 38.2%. Backlog stands at $30 million, signaling pipeline strength amid LEO ramp-up. KVH targets maritime satcom's $3-4B market, holding ~4-6% share in VSAT segment.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $22.6M (consensus miss); Q3 guidance $23-25M; reaffirmed FY2024 revenue $95-105M.

Strong LEO upside (30-50% revenue boost potential by 2026) offsets near-term losses; moderate risk from competition/execution. Suitable for growth portfolios eyeing satcom disruption.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $8.50 (75% upside). DCF-based (8% CAGR revenue, 20% margins by 2027; 12x EV/Sales multiple on $130M 2026 rev), aligned with peers. Catalysts: Q4 LEO activations, Q3 earnings (Nov 2024). Risks: Starlink pricing war (-20% FV sensitivity).",

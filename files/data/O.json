The estimate considers:\n- Management projections of $6.2 billion revenue and $1.6 billion earnings by 2028, yielding estimated fair value of $63.35\n- Wall Street median price target of $62.65\n- Community estimates ranging from $55-$96 per share\n- Dividend discount model supporting sustainable 5.5% yield with modest growth\n- Premium valuation justified by quality of assets, tenant diversification, and dividend aristocrat status\n\n**Investment Recommendation:**\nSuitable for conservative income-focused investors seeking monthly dividend income with modest capital appreciation potential. The stock offers defensive characteristics during market volatility but may underperform in aggressive growth environments. Consider position sizing appropriate for income allocation rather than growth objectives.",

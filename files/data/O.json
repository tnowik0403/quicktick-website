As \"The Monthly Dividend Company,\" it owns and manages a diversified portfolio of approximately 15,597 properties across all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., and Europe, leased to ~950 tenants under long-term agreements (average remaining lease term ~9.1 years as of Q2 2024). The portfolio spans retail (convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores), industrial (distribution centers), gaming (casinos), office, and emerging sectors like data centers and manufacturing. Realty Income benefits from investment-grade tenants (48.6% of annualized base rent from investment-grade rated companies) and a mission-critical occupancy rate of 98.7%. It has paid 658 consecutive monthly dividends and increased its dividend 130 times since its 1994 NYSE listing, making it a Dividend Aristocrat and S&P 500 member. The company's scale—bolstered by the $9.3B acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital in January 2024—positions it as the world's largest net lease REIT by market capitalization (~$52.8B as of October 11, 2024). Realty Income focuses on recession-resistant, e-commerce-resistant assets, generating stable cash flows through NNN leases where tenants cover taxes, maintenance, and insurance.

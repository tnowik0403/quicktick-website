Grid Modernization: Deploying advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and 'self-healing' automation devices to detect and isolate faults, reducing outage duration.

Growth Strategy\n\nCenterPoint's growth strategy focuses on several key areas:\n\n**Texas Concentration:**\nCenterPoint Energy is executing a deliberate portfolio shift toward Texas, where post-Ohio sale the state will represent over 70% of investments. Strategic Ohio unit sale at 26x earnings funds cap-ex and accelerates CNP's Texas pure-play transition, reducing near-term equity issuance needs.\n\n**EPS Growth Targets:**\nRaised long-term non-GAAP EPS annual growth target to 7%-9% through 2035, expecting to deliver at the mid-to-high end for 2026-2028. Targeting 7%-9% annual non-GAAP EPS growth from 2026 through 2035.\n\n**Data Center Opportunities:**\nWith 47 gigawatts of interconnection requests (20 GW from data centers), CNP has built a \"brownfield\" transmission advantage where existing rights-of-way and substations enable faster, cheaper expansion than greenfield projects. Data center developers face 2-3 year interconnection queues elsewhere, while CNP's existing capacity and streamlined processes can connect loads in months. The company has already connected over 0.5 gigawatts of data center capacity in 2025 alone.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCenterPoint serves diverse customer segments:\n\n**Current Customer Base:**\n- More than 7 million metered customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas.\n- CES provides competitive natural gas sales, storage and supply, and other energy-related solutions to approximately 30,000 commercial and industrial customers, utilities and municipalities in more than 30 states.\n\n**Growth Sectors in Texas:**\nJason Wells highlighted the diversity of growth drivers in the Greater Houston area, including data centers, energy refining, processing, exports, and increased activity at the Port of Houston, which saw an 18% increase in exports quarter-over-quarter.\n\n**Data Center Clients:**\nCenterPoint is well-positioned to deliver on data center opportunities in Indiana due to excess capacity and a constructive environment for land and resources. The company is focused on affordability and moderating rate increases while working to attract economic development.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nCenterPoint Energy Inc (NYSE:CNP) reported a strong third quarter with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.50, representing a 60% increase over the same period last year. Net income of $293 million, or $0.45 per diluted share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.30 per diluted share in the comparable period of 2024.\n\nCenterPoint Energy (CNP) reported $1.99 billion in revenue for the quarter ended September 2025, representing a year-over-year increase of 7.1%. EPS of $0.50 for the same period compares to $0.31 a year ago.\n\n**Financial Metrics:**\n- As of September 30, 2025, the company owned approximately $45 billion in assets.\n- FFO to Debt Ratio: 14% as of Q3 2025, based on Moody's rating methodology.\n- Revenue (ttm) 9.11B, Net Income Available to Common (ttm) 1.04B, Diluted EPS (ttm) 1.58\n\n**Guidance:**\nReiterated 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.75-$1.77, representing 9% growth over 2024. 2026 non-GAAP EPS guidance set at $1.89-$1.91, an 8% increase over 2025 midpoint.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Major Tailwinds:**\n- **Texas Demand Growth:** The Houston Electric peak load is forecasted to increase by nearly 50% to almost 31 gigawatts (GWs) by 2031, driven by population growth, electrification, and new data center demand.\n- **Industrial Load Growth:** Houston Electric industrial throughput spiked over 17% quarter over quarter, with year-to-date industrial demand up 11%. This differentiated load growth in the core territory supports the need and regulatory certainty for massive capital deployment.\n- **Data Center Demand:** CenterPoint's peak load is expected to climb by 10 GW – almost double the current load – by 2031, he said. \"We continue to see more tailwinds than headwinds,\" particularly in Texas, he said.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Higher Financing Costs:** The company noted a $0.04 per share headwind from increased interest expense, highlighting the rising cost of financing.\n- **Credit Metrics Pressure:** The company's 14.1% adjusted FFO-to-debt ratio (Moody's methodology) sits 100-150 basis points above the 13% downgrade threshold, providing cushion but limiting room for error. Competitors like ATO (0.69 debt-to-equity) and NI (1.41 debt-to-equity) carry less leverage.\n- **Regulatory Recovery Risk:** There is a reliance on regulatory approvals for capital recovery mechanisms, which could impact financial performance if not obtained.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nCenterPoint holds significant positions in its service territories:\n\n**Texas Market Position:**\nCenterPoint Energy benefits from a regulated monopoly in its service territories, particularly in the Houston metropolitan area. This status provides a stable revenue stream because rates are set by regulatory bodies.\n\n**Regional Coverage:**\nPro forma for CNP Ohio, National Fuel's gas utility business will now serve approximately 1.1 million customers across three contiguous cold-weather states – New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. This indicates CenterPoint's Ohio operations served a substantial portion of the state's natural gas customers.\n\n**Asset Scale:**\nStrategic investments in infrastructure, with $22.7 billion planned from 2024 to 2028, enhance service reliability. The company's strong presence in key economic hubs, like Houston, supports long-term growth.\n\n## 10.

Major competitors include:\n- OGE Energy Corp., FirstEnergy Corp., American Electric Power Company, Inc., WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\n**Competitive Position:**\nThe company reaffirmed its 2025 non-GAAP EPS range of $1.75-$1.77 (9% growth over 2024) and its 2026 non-GAAP EPS range of $1.89-$1.91 (8% growth over the 2025 midpoint).

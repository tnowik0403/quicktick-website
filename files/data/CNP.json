(CNP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Latest Data Snapshot (as of December 5, 2024)**  \n- **Current Stock Price**: $30.85 (Yahoo Finance, real-time close).  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $19.45 billion (Yahoo Finance).  \n- **52-Week Range**: $25.60 - $31.31.  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 20.35.  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 2.60% (quarterly dividend of $0.20/share, ex-date Nov 19, 2024).  \n\n## Company Overview  \nCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP) is a leading investor-owned electric and natural gas utility serving approximately 7 million metered customers across six states, primarily in the Midwest and southern U.S. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates through three main segments: Electric Transmission & Distribution (T&D), serving 2.9 million electric customers mainly in the Houston metropolitan area (greater than 85% of its electric load); Natural Gas Distribution (NGD), delivering to 3.4 million gas customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas; and CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, focused on regulated T&D infrastructure. CNP invests heavily in grid resilience, modernization, and enabling clean energy transitions, with a $11.5 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 emphasizing reliability amid growing demand from electrification, EVs, and data centers. The company benefits from Texas' deregulated market structure, where it focuses on wires-only operations, avoiding generation risks. Recent challenges include Hurricane Beryl (July 8-9, 2024), which caused $1.7 billion in restoration costs (mostly unrecovered capex), but also unlocked regulatory rate hikes. CNP targets 6-8% long-term EPS growth through regulated returns (9.5-10% ROE in key jurisdictions) and infrastructure investments, positioning it as a defensive utility play with exposure to high-growth Texas demand.

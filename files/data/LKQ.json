Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, LKQ operates in three main segments: North America (largest, ~56% of 2023 revenue), Europe (~38%), and Specialty (e.g., performance parts, ~6%). The company sources parts through self-manufacturing, recycling from salvage yards (over 400 in North America), remanufacturing, and partnerships with OEMs for alternative parts. LKQ supplies collision and mechanical repairers, including body shops, independent repairers, and fleet operators, via a network of ~1,700 distribution centers, wholesale locations, and e-commerce platforms like lkqonline.com. In 2023, it served over 100,000 customers, emphasizing faster delivery and lower costs than OEM parts amid aging vehicle parc (average U.S. vehicle age ~12.5 years). LKQ has grown via aggressive M&A (e.g., 2022 acquisition of Whips for $1.7B, expanding wholesale), organic sales growth, and digital tools like AI-driven inventory management. Recent challenges include FX headwinds in Europe and softer wholesale demand, but tailwinds from vehicle miles driven (up 2.5% YoY in U.S.) support resilience. Trailing 12-month revenue: ~$14.3B.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 24, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released. North America Parts & Services organic sales down 1.9% YoY; Europe up 0.4% organically.

Growth upside from EV/digital/M&A (~10-12% EPS CAGR to 2026 per consensus), but moderate risks from cyclical wholesale/EV disruption justify Hold over aggressive Buy. Moderate risk appetite fits: beta 1.2, 45% FCF yield.  \n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $48**  \n(DCFF model: 10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; implies 25% upside. Aligns with consensus PT $53 from 12 analysts, per Yahoo Finance Oct 4.)",

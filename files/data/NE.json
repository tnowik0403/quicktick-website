Headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, with operations spanning the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Guyana, Africa, and other regions, Noble owns and operates a modern fleet of 32 jackups (including high-spec harsh-environment units) and 8 floaters (5 drillships and 3 semi-submersibles) as of Q2 2024. The company focuses on ultra-deepwater and harsh-environment drilling, targeting major oil companies seeking efficient, safe operations in complex reservoirs. \n\nFormed through the 2022 merger with Maersk Drilling, Noble has positioned itself as a top-tier driller with a young fleet (average age ~10 years), emphasizing fleet renewal, dayrate optimization, and sustainability via electrification initiatives. In 2023, it generated $2.85B in revenue, driven by strong contract backlogs amid elevated oil prices and offshore exploration demand. Noble's strategy hinges on disciplined capital allocation, returning ~50% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, while investing in upgrades like managed pressure drilling (MPD) systems on 85% of its floaters. As of September 2024, its contract backlog stands at ~$4.7B through 2026, providing revenue visibility.

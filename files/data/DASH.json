(NASDAQ: DASH) is the leading on-demand local logistics platform in the U.S., primarily operating as a food delivery marketplace connecting consumers, restaurants, dashers (independent contractors), and grocers. Founded in 2013 and public since Dec 2020, it dominates the $100B+ U.S. food delivery market with ~67% share (per 2025 Third Bridge report cited in Q3 2025 earnings). Beyond food (core ~85% of Marketplace Gross Order Value or GOV), DoorDash has expanded into grocery (~10% GOV), alcohol, convenience retail, and enterprise offerings like DoorDash Drive for B2B deliveries.\n\nIn 2025, DoorDash reported total orders of 2.2B (up 18% YoY per Q3 earnings), with Marketplace GOV at $20.7B in Q3 alone (up 22% YoY). The platform leverages AI-driven routing, dynamic pricing, and DashPass subscriptions (24M+ members as of Q3 2025) for retention. Internationally, it operates in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii, but U.S. drives 90%+ revenue. Challenges include profitability pressures from high contractor costs and competition, yet Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA hit $480M (up 130% YoY), signaling scale. With 950K+ active dashers and 500K+ merchants, DoorDash is pivoting to \"local commerce everywhere,\" targeting non-restaurant verticals amid slowing core growth.

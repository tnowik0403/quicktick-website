Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nDoorDash has announced several significant initiatives for 2025 and beyond:\n\n**Autonomous Delivery Platform:**\n- Dot is powered by our Autonomous Delivery Platform, an AI-enabled system designed to match every order with the best delivery method — whether that's a Dasher, a robot, a drone, or Dot. Dot is live now in the Phoenix metro area, with an early access program giving locals the first chance to experience it.\n\n**SmartScale Technology:**\n- We're introducing the SmartScale, a compact hardware solution developed by DoorDash Labs to help restaurants improve order accuracy and streamline operations. By combining precise weighing technology with predictive modeling, SmartScale verifies that every order matches its expected contents before it leaves the kitchen – cutting missing item claims by up to 30%.\n\n**DashMart Fulfillment Services:**\n- We're launching DashMart Fulfillment Services, a new way for retailers to strengthen the reach of their products and gain visibility with potential new customers. The model uses DoorDash's network of DashMart locations to handle the entire process, from inventory management, picking, packing, and delivery by Dashers. CVS and Party City are already using the service, and Kroger will soon join them, bringing its wide selection of groceries and household essentials to shoppers nationwide through DashMart Fulfillment Services.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nIt also anticipates spending \"several hundred million dollars more\" in 2026 on new products and an internal platform that will help improve operational consistency and product development speed. Its catalysts are dual: building a \"new global tech platform\" to unify its acquired brands and investing in autonomous delivery.\n\nWhat if the consumer-facing DoorDash app was just one facet of a much larger, more powerful logistics machine? This is the sophisticated idea behind DoorDash Drive, the company's white-label delivery solution. This initiative marks a pivotal shift from being solely a business-to-consumer (B2C) application to also becoming a comprehensive business-to-business (B2B) logistics provider.\n\n**Key Strategic Pillars:**\n- DoorDash's strategy centers on increasing order frequency and basket size. User Segmentation: Tailored offers for high-frequency users vs casual diners. Upselling: Suggesting premium items, bundles, or add-ons during checkout. Cross-Selling: Promoting grocery, retail, and flower delivery to existing food customers.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Partnerships:**\n- Starting October 1, nearly 2,700 Kroger stores will launch on DoorDash, making Kroger the largest grocer on our platform. Customers will have access to Kroger's full grocery assortment — from fresh foods to household staples, including its popular Our Brand products — delivered in as little as an hour.\n- CVS Pharmacy, Kroger, and Party City were some of the first partnerships announced.\n\n**Client Scale:**\n- Including Deliveroo, we now serve over 50 million MAUs, over 30 million consumers through our membership programs, partner with more than 1 million merchants, and generate over $100 billion in annualized Marketplace GOV across more than 40 countries.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Revenue increased 27% Y/Y to $3.4 billion.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- DoorDash continues to face increased regulatory scrutiny, along with other industry players across multiple fronts, especially in the U.S. One of the main regulatory pressures is related to commission fees. Regulators in some cities, including New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Seattle, have deemed the 30% commission fees charged by DoorDash as exorbitant and harmful to restaurants. Consequently, these regulators have placed fee caps on commission fees.\n- Another regulatory issue for DoorDash is the reclassification of Dashers from contractors to full-time employees eligible for benefits such as guaranteed minimum wages, overtime pay, mileage reimbursements, and health plans.\n- Nonetheless, challenges persist. Regulatory concerns over autonomous vehicles and intense competition in the food and grocery delivery space could slow expansion.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Regulatory Tailwinds: Continued approval for expansion in Asia-Pacific and Latin America will be critical. Diversification Success: Growth in grocery delivery and advertising (which already generates $1 billion annually) could unlock new revenue streams\n- DoorDash is increasingly linking growth with environmental responsibility: It promotes reusable packaging initiatives and reduces cutlery waste among its merchant network. It encourages drivers (Dashers) to use low-emission vehicles and pushes for greener logistics. These measures help strengthen the DoorDash value proposition for users who care about eco-impact, especially when \"delivery to me\" also means \"less footprint\".\n\n## 9.

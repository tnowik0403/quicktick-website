(DCOM) is a bank holding company headquartered in Hauppauge, New York, operating through its subsidiary Dime Community Bank. Founded in 1909 as the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, it has evolved into a leading community bank serving the New York metropolitan area, with a primary focus on commercial real estate (CRE) lending, particularly multifamily properties. The bank offers a range of deposit products (checking, savings, money market, CDs) and lending solutions including multifamily mortgages, commercial real estate loans, commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, and residential mortgages. As of Q2 2024, DCOM managed $14.1 billion in total assets, with a loan portfolio dominated by multifamily loans (~70% of total loans, concentrated in rent-stabilized NYC properties). Deposits stood at $10.6 billion, primarily from commercial and municipal sources. DCOM emphasizes relationship banking, serving small-to-medium businesses, real estate investors, and municipalities across Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau, Suffolk, and select NJ markets. It differentiates through high-touch service, local expertise in NYC's regulated rental market, and a conservative underwriting approach amid CRE challenges. Recent strategic shifts include diversification into C&I lending (now ~15% of portfolio) to reduce CRE concentration risks.

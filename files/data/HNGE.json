Please confirm all critical data independently, as AI models may hallucinate. These reports are for educational purposes only, and should not be solely used for investment decisions.\n\nGrok's API is currently limited to information up to the **end of 2024**. Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Listed on OTC Pink Sheets under \"No Information\" status (source: OTC Markets Group). Last quoted bid/ask from historical data pre-2020 is ~$0.0001 (negligible volume).  \n- **Market Capitalization**: Not applicable / $0 (inactive shell company with no shares outstanding updates or trading).  \n- **Exchange**: OTC Pink (HNGE).  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nHinge Global Inc. (HNGE) is a dormant shell company with no significant operations, previously positioned in the mobile social discovery space. Incorporated in the past as a provider of a mobile social discovery application aimed at helping smartphone users meet new people (similar to early dating/matchmaking apps), the company has been inactive for nearly a decade. According to OTC Markets and last available SEC filings (e.g., 10-K from 2015), HNGE ceased meaningful business activities around 2015-2016, transitioning into a non-operating entity. It holds no substantial assets, generates no revenue, and has no employees or ongoing projects. The company is categorized under \"Pink No Information,\" indicating failure to file current reports with OTC Markets or SEC, making it a classic OTC penny stock graveyard resident. No website, investor relations contact, or public disclosures exist post-2018. HNGE shares trade sporadically at sub-penny levels with zero liquidity, posing extreme risk of total loss. Real-time searches across Google News, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, and SEC EDGAR yield no updates since 2018, confirming its defunct status in the oversaturated dating/social app sector dominated by giants like Match Group (MTCH).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- No announcements, press releases, or news articles in the last 6+ years (verified via Google News, Business Wire, PR Newswire searches up to Oct 10, 2024).\n- Last SEC filing: Form 15-12G (termination of registration) around 2016; no 10-Q/10-K since 2015.\n- No earnings calls, transcripts, or investor updates. Online discussions (Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter/X): Zero mentions in 2024; sporadic spam/scam alerts from 2020-2022 warning of pump-and-dump schemes.\n- No corporate actions like reverse splits (last noted 2016).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- N/A: No stated strategy, management team, or operational plans. Effectively a shell for potential reverse merger (common for OTC shells), but no activity.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Complete operational halt; no filings; illiquid shares; regulatory delisting risk; history of non-compliance. | None identifiable. |\n| **Sector (Social/Dating Apps)** | Intense competition from MTCH (Tinder/Hinge), Bumble (BMBL); market saturation; privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA); ad revenue volatility. | AI-driven personalization growth; global expansion in emerging markets (but irrelevant to HNGE). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- None active. Historical: Mobile app for social discovery/meetups (discontinued pre-2016).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- None planned or in development. No R&D, patents, or pipeline mentions.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- Global social/dating app market: HNGE ~0% (inactive).\n- U.S. market: 0%.\n\n## Forecast of Growth/Decline in Market Share\n- Continued 0% share; high probability of delisting or further obscurity. No growth catalysts.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric | HNGE | Match Group (MTCH) | Bumble (BMBL) |\n|--------|------|---------------------|---------------|\n| **Revenue (Latest FY, verified <6mo where appl.)** | $0 (N/A) | $3.5B (2023 10-K) | $1.0B (2023 10-K) |\n| **Market Cap** | $0 | ~$10B | ~$1.5B |\n| **Active Users** | 0 | 100M+ | 50M+ |\n| **Key Differentiator** | None | Portfolio of apps (Tinder, Hinge) | Women-first model |\n| **Performance** | Defunct | Stable growth | Volatile post-IPO |\n\nHNGE lags infinitely; competitors have scaled via M&A and monetization.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- None recent or historical post-2015.\n- No inbound interest as shell.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- None. No B2B/B2C revenue model active.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: Unknown/uncontactable; no bios or updates.\n- **Risks**: Total illiquidity; scam potential; zero transparency.\n- **ESG**: N/A.\n- **Analyst Coverage**: Zero (no sell-side reports).\n- **Sentiment**: Negative (scam warnings on OTC forums); no bullish chatter.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 1/10 (**STRONG SELL**). Avoid entirely – zero upside, 100% downside risk. Suitable only for speculative gamblers, not moderate risk portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.00. No assets, operations, or catalysts justify any premium. Portfolio seeking strong growth upside should ignore; liquidation value approaches zero. Hold existing positions? Liquidate immediately.",

(COLB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $21.85 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.22 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $17.34 - $28.02  \n\n## Company Overview\nColumbia Financial, Inc. (COLB) is the holding company for Columbia Bank, a full-service regional bank founded in 1926 and headquartered in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. The bank operates approximately 234 branches across New Jersey (primary market), New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, serving retail, commercial, and municipal customers. Its core business revolves around deposit gathering (checking, savings, CDs) and lending, with a loan portfolio dominated by commercial real estate (CRE, ~70%), multi-family residential (~15%), and commercial & industrial (C&I, ~10%). Columbia differentiates through a community-focused model, emphasizing relationship banking, digital enhancements, and disciplined underwriting amid competitive deposit markets. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $15.2 billion, with deposits at $12.6 billion (per Q2 earnings release, July 25, 2024). The company has pursued organic growth via de novo branching and selective M&A, while navigating post-SVB banking pressures like elevated funding costs and CRE scrutiny. Recent profitability challenges stem from net interest margin (NIM) compression (2.66% in Q2 2024 vs. 3.07% YoY), but improving deposit costs and loan pipelines signal stabilization. Columbia trades at ~12x forward EPS, reflecting regional bank valuation discounts, with upside tied to Fed rate cuts and CRE resilience.

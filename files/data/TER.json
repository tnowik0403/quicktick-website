The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI infrastructure buildout driving semiconductor testing demand, with a strong competitive moat in the ATE market. However, the premium valuation (~80x P/E) limits upside potential and increases downside risk if growth expectations aren't met. The fair value range of $190-$200 suggests modest upside from current levels, making it suitable for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite who believe in the long-term AI and automation trends. The upcoming Michigan expansion and strategic partnerships position TER well for 2026-2028 growth, despite near-term valuation concerns.",

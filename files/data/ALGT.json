Daily Volume: 430,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAllegiant Travel Company (ALGT) operates Allegiant Air, a U.S.-based ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) founded in 1997 and headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company focuses on providing nonstop leisure flights from ~100 small-to-medium cities in the U.S. and Canada to top leisure destinations like Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, and Hawaiian islands. Unlike traditional airlines, Allegiant emphasizes point-to-point routes avoiding hub-and-spoke models, enabling super-low base fares supplemented by high-margin ancillary revenues (e.g., seat selection, baggage fees, bundled travel packages). It serves price-sensitive leisure travelers, primarily VFR (visiting friends/relatives) and sun-seekers, with a fleet of ~120 aircraft (mostly Airbus A319/A320 and Boeing 737-400/800 variants). Beyond air travel, ALGT diversifies via Allegiant Vacations (hotel/car bundles) and owned assets like the Sunseeker Resort in Punta Gorda, Florida. In 2023, it transported ~18 million passengers with total ancillary revenue at ~65% of sales. The model thrives on operational efficiency, high aircraft utilization (12-13 hrs/day), and route optimization via proprietary software, but faces volatility from fuel prices, engine maintenance, and leisure demand cycles.

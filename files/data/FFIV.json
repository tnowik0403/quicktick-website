(FFIV) is a leading provider of multi-cloud application security, delivery, and performance solutions, enabling organizations to deploy, secure, operate, and protect applications across any environment—on-premises, hybrid, multi-cloud, or edge. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Seattle, WA, F5's portfolio centers on its flagship BIG-IP platform, a hardware/software appliance for application delivery controllers (ADCs), load balancing, and traffic management. The company has evolved from traditional ADC leadership to a full-stack security and orchestration provider, bolstered by acquisitions like NGINX (2019), Shape Security (2020), and Volterra (2021). In FY2023 (ended Sep 30, 2023), F5 served ~50% of Fortune 500 companies, focusing on high-margin software and SaaS subscriptions amid cloud-native shifts. Recent emphasis on AI-driven security and distributed cloud services positions F5 for secular growth in cybersecurity and app modernization, with ~55% of revenue now recurring.

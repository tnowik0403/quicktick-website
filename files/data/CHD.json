Arm & Hammer leans into delivering good-enough-to-excellent results at lower shelf prices, particularly in larger family-sized formats.\n\n### Market Resilience:\nThe company's product mix is unusually resilient to macro shocks. Laundry detergent, cat litter, oral care, condoms, pregnancy tests, and vitamins are not impulse purchases. They are recurring necessities.

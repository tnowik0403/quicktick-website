The company develops, manufactures, and markets a diverse portfolio of household, personal care, and specialty consumer products under iconic brands such as Arm & Hammer, Trojan, OxiClean, First Response, Spinbrush, Batiste, Waterpik, and Vitafusion. Its product lines span baking soda-based cleaning solutions, oral care, sexual wellness, pregnancy and ovulation tests, dry shampoos, water flossers, and gummy vitamins.

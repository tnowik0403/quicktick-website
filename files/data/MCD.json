The company generates nearly all revenue (95%+) from franchised locations, earning primarily through royalties (about 4-5% of sales), rent, and initial fees. Iconic menu staples include the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, World Famous Fries, McNuggets, and McCafé beverages. McDonald's serves over 70 million customers daily, emphasizing speed, affordability, value meals, and digital innovation via the McDonald's app (over 50 million active users globally). The business model leverages a real estate empire (owns ~70% of restaurant buildings and land), providing stable rental income. In 2023, systemwide sales exceeded $130 billion, with company-operated margins at ~45%. Recent focus areas include menu simplification, loyalty program expansion (150+ million members), and drive-thru/digital sales (40%+ of U.S. sales). Challenges include U.S. middle-market softness and health-conscious trends, but global scale and franchise resilience drive long-term dominance in the $800B+ global QSR sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 28, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings released – Global comparable sales +0.1% (U.S. -0.7%, International Developmental Markets +1.9%, International Operated Markets +3.1%). Revenue $6.769B (+0.4% YoY). Diluted EPS $3.08 (+5% YoY). Operating income $3.360B (+3%). Company-operated restaurant margins 44.5%. Raised FY2024 EPS guidance midpoint to ~$11.80-$12.00 (from $11.69-$11.87).\n- **October 2024**: E. coli outbreak linked to slivered onions in Quarter Pounders affected ~50 cases across 10 U.S. states; McDonald's paused onion use Oct 23, confirmed supplier issue Oct 24, leading to ~2-3% U.S. same-store sales dip in late Oct.\n- **September 26, 2024**: Announced $5B share repurchase authorization over next few years.\n- **July 30, 2024**: Q2 earnings – Global comp sales +1.3%; U.S. flat.

Brands filings).\n| Region | McDonald's Share | Key Notes |\n|--------|------------------|-----------|\n| U.S. QSR | ~15% (vs. 14% in 2023) | Chick-fil-A #1 chicken (~12%); Subway sandwiches. |\n| Global Fast Food | ~10-12% | Dominates burgers (~40% share). |\n| China QSR | ~10% | KFC leads at 12%; adding 1,000 stores by 2028. |\n\n**Forecast**: Stable-to-slight growth (+0.5-1% annually to 2027) via EM expansion/digital; U.S. flat amid competition (per JPMorgan/analyst consensus).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (TTM as of Q3 2024) | MCD | YUM (KFC/Taco Bell) | QSR (BK/Tim Hortons) | DPZ (Domino's) |\n|----------------------------|-----|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Revenue | $25.49B | $7.39B | $7.1B | $4.7B |\n| Comp Sales Growth (Q3) | +0.1% | +3% | -1.5% | +0.4% |\n| Op. Margin | 44% | 28% | 25% | 20% |\n| EV/EBITDA | 16x | 18x | 14x | 19x |\n| Market Share (U.S. QSR) | 15% | 8% | 6% | 3% (pizza) |\n\nMCD leads in scale/margins; lags YUM in EM chicken growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Google Cloud (AI/dynamic pricing, 2021+); Uber Eats (global delivery); Coca-Cola (exclusive beverages); Microsoft (EV charging pilots, 2024).\n- **M&A**: Minimal; acquired franchisee Dynamic Yield ($300M, 2022) for personalization. No major 2024 deals; focus on buybacks ($25B since 2020).\n- **Clients/Suppliers**: Franchisees (~39,000 owners); major suppliers: Cargill (beef), Lamb Weston (fries). Potential: EV charging networks (e.g., Electrify America tie-ups).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Net-zero by 2050 pledge; 30% cage-free eggs goal met early. Supplier audits strong.\n- **Management**: CEO Chris Kempczinski (since 2019); high insider ownership (0.5%).\n- **Risks**: Franchisee unrest (NV CA wage hikes); currency (10% revenue exposure).\n- **Opportunities**: $20B+ U.S. drive-thru optimization; India/China store growth (4,000+ by 2028).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy) – Strong fundamentals (margin resilience, dividend aristocrat 48 years) offset near-term U.S. weakness (boycotts/E.coli). Attractive vs. peers on margins/scale; rebound potential post-Q4 value push.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $310 (16% upside) – Based on 23x FY2025 EPS consensus $13.50 (Bloomberg, Nov 2024), 4% growth + 2.5% yield for moderate-risk growth portfolio. Catalysts: Q4 comps >1%, CosMc's scale. Risks: Prolonged U.S. slump (downside $240).",

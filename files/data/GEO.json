(GEO) is a diversified government services provider and real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on designing, financing, constructing, and operating secure facilities, community reentry centers, and electronic monitoring solutions for federal, state, and local governments worldwide. Headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, GEO manages approximately 99 owned or leased facilities with over 80,000 beds across the U.S., Australia, South Africa, and the U.K. Its core segments include U.S. corrections and detention (61% of revenue), GEO Care (reentry, mental health, youth services; 13%), International Services (19%), and Facility Construction & Design (7%). Through its BI Incorporated subsidiary, GEO leads in electronic monitoring with ankle bracelets and voice recognition tech, serving ICE and probation/parole agencies. Originally a private prison operator since 1984, GEO converted to a REIT in December 2021 to optimize taxes and dividends (currently suspended). It reported serving 2023 average daily populations of ~77,000 in corrections/detention.

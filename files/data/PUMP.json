(PUMP) is a premier provider of hydraulic fracturing (frac) and complementary services to major upstream oil and gas companies in North America, with a primary focus on the prolific Permian Basin. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Midland, Texas, the company operates a modern fleet emphasizing efficiency, safety, and sustainability. As of Q2 2024 earnings (released August 7, 2024), ProPetro maintained 27 active frac fleets, delivering high-pressure pumping services critical for unconventional shale development. Complementary offerings include cementing, acidizing, and flowback. The company differentiates through its \"Duty Cycle\" performance metrics, electric frac fleets (e-fleets), and Tier IV Dual Fuel (DGB) technology, reducing emissions and fuel costs. ProPetro serves blue-chip E&P clients like Pioneer Natural Resources and Occidental Petroleum, benefiting from the Permian's low breakeven economics amid WTI crude ~$70-75/bbl. With ~1.5 million fracturing horsepower (HHP) under management, PUMP targets operational excellence in a consolidating industry, positioning for multi-year Permian growth as U.S. oil production hits records near 13.4 MMbbl/d (EIA data, Sept 2024).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024):** Revenue $426.8 million (+14.6% YoY from $372.4M).

(XTNT) is a medical technology company specializing in orthopedic products for spine and orthobiologic applications. Headquartered in Belgrade, Montana, the company develops, manufactures, and markets biologic structural allografts and advanced fusion technologies primarily for spinal fusion surgeries. Its portfolio includes human tissue-based bone graft substitutes (e.g., OsteoCel Cellular Allografts), demineralized bone matrices (e.g., BioSet Allograft), and bovine-derived biomaterials, alongside sterile surgical kits, packed bone allografts, and metallic spinal implant systems acquired via the 2022 X-Spine purchase. XTNT operates through two segments: OrthoBiologics (tissue-based biologics) and Spinal Fixation (implants/hardware). Serving U.S. hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and surgeons, XTNT emphasizes cost-effective, clinically validated solutions amid a shift toward outpatient procedures. With ~100 employees and FY2023 revenue of $52.2M (up 4% YoY), the company targets the $7B+ U.S. spine biologics market, focusing on minimally invasive techniques and value-based care. Recent profitability improvements stem from operational efficiencies, supply chain optimizations, and product expansions, positioning XTNT as a niche player in a consolidating sector dominated by giants like Medtronic and Stryker.

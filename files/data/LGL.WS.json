(Ticker: LGL; Warrants: LGL.WS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Note on Ticker and Data Sources**: Real-time web search (via Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, SEC EDGAR, company IR site, Seeking Alpha, MarketWatch, and earnings transcripts as of October 11, 2024) confirms LGL is the common stock (NYSE American: LGL). LGL.WS appears as a low-volume, thinly traded warrant series (OTC-linked, exercise price ~$11.50, expiration December 2026 per historical issuance data from 2021 PIPE), with latest quote $0.04 (bid/ask spread wide at $0.01-$0.10, volume <100 shares/day). Analysis focuses on underlying company fundamentals, as warrants derive value from LGL common. All quantitative financials from verified Q2 2024 earnings (reported August 14, 2024, <6 months old) and equivalents. No Q3 2024 data available yet. Stock price/market cap as of market close October 11, 2024: LGL $5.22, market cap $27.85M (5.34M shares outstanding).\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nThe LGL Group, Inc. is a U.S.-based designer, manufacturer, and marketer of highly-engineered electronic components used in mission-critical applications. Operating primarily through subsidiaries MtronPTI Corporation (frequency control products) and Mtron Industries (microwave filters), LGL serves defense/aerospace (60%+ revenue), telecommunications, and industrial markets. Products enable precise timing, synchronization, and signal filtering in extreme environments (e.g., space, hypersonics, EW systems). Founded in 1928, headquartered in Orlando, FL, with facilities in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, LGL targets high-reliability, ITAR-compliant solutions for U.S. government and prime contractors. Post-2021 acquisition of Mtron Industries, LGL has ~180 employees and focuses on \"made-in-USA\" supply chain resilience amid geopolitical shifts. Revenue is lumpy due to defense contract cycles, but backlog stood at $20M+ as of Q2 2024. The company benefits from rising DoD budgets but faces competition in commoditized segments. Warrants (LGL.WS) offer leveraged upside to common stock above exercise price but carry dilution/expiration risk.\n\n## Current Stock Information (as of October 11, 2024)\n| Metric | LGL (Common) | LGL.WS (Warrants) |\n|--------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Price | $5.22 | $0.04 |\n| Market Cap | $27.85M | N/A (derivative) |\n| 52-Week Range | $4.50 - $8.45 | $0.01 - $0.25 |\n| Avg.

Top results redirect to **FVRR** (Fiverr International Ltd), a prominent growth stock in the freelance marketplace sector. Analysis assumes this is the intended company based on phonetic/typing similarity, market relevance, and search prominence. No other viable matches (e.g., ASX:FVR is a small Australian media firm, irrelevant to U.S. financial context).\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of market close October 3, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $17.55\n- **Market Capitalization**: $685.3 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $14.55 - $32.89\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **EV/Revenue (TTM)**: 1.8x\n\n## Company Overview\nFiverr International Ltd (FVRR) operates a global online marketplace connecting over 4 million freelancers (\"sellers\") with 3.5+ million buyers seeking digital services. Founded in 2010 and IPO'd in 2019, Fiverr democratizes access to talent for gigs starting at $5, spanning categories like graphic design, programming, digital marketing, writing, video/animation, music, and business consulting. Its platform leverages AI-driven matching, personalization, and tools to facilitate transactions, with revenue primarily from take rates (5-20% commissions on GMV). \n\nFiverr has evolved from simple micro-tasks to complex, high-value \"Pro\" services ($400+ avg order value) and enterprise solutions for large-scale projects. As of Q2 2024, it boasts 830,000+ active sellers and processes $364M quarterly GMV. The company targets SMBs (80% of buyers) and enterprises (growing segment), with 80% U.S. revenue but expanding internationally (e.g., Europe, Asia). Amid gig economy digitization and AI disruption, Fiverr positions as an \"operating system for digital talent,\" integrating generative AI to boost efficiency. Challenges include macroeconomic sensitivity and competition, but tailwinds from remote work and AI adoption support mid-teens GMV growth potential.

Fits moderate risk/growth portfolio.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$26** (12-month target; 48% upside from $17.55). Based on 2025E revenue $410M at 2.5x EV/Rev + 25% GMV growth; DCF assumes 12% WACC, 5% terminal growth. (Consensus aligns: 8 analysts, avg $28.60 per Yahoo Finance Oct 4, 2024).",

Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Price:** $164.89 (January 6, 2026)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $47.33B - $45.17B  \n**52-Week Range:** $149.75 - $457.22  \n\n---\n\n## Company Overview\n\nStrategy Inc, together with its subsidiaries, operates as a bitcoin treasury company in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and internationally. The company offers investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. It also provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software, including Strategy One, which provides non-technical users with the ability to directly access novel and actionable insights for decision-making and Strategy Mosaic, a universal intelligence layer that offers enterprises with consistent definitions and governance across data sources, regardless of where that data resides or which tools access it.\n\nThe company was formerly known as MicroStrategy Incorporated and changed its name to Strategy Inc in August 2025. The definitive turning point occurred in August 2020. Faced with a stagnant stock price and a cash-heavy balance sheet being eroded by inflation, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy would adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. This radical pivot transformed the company from a slow-growth tech firm into a pioneer of corporate digital asset adoption, sparking a multi-year transformation that has completely redefined its market identity.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Earnings Highlights\n- **Bitcoin Holdings:** 640,808 Bitcoin, representing over 3% of all Bitcoin ever to exist, acquired for a total of $47.44 billion at an average price of $74,032 per coin\n- **Financial Performance:** Q3 2025 Operating Income: $3.9 billion, Q3 2025 Net Income: $2.8 billion, Q3 2025 Earnings Per Share (EPS): $8.43\n- **Revenue:** Total revenues for Q3 reached $128.7 million, up 10.9% year-over-year\n- **Bitcoin Performance:** The company reported a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 26%, generating $12.9 billion in gains amid the ongoing 2025 crypto bull market\n\n### Recent Capital Market Activity\n- Strategy has announced a significant $2.1 billion At-The-Market (ATM) Program for its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock.

The first is its legacy software segment, which provides enterprise analytics and business intelligence platforms. This business has shifted toward a cloud-first, subscription-based model (SaaS), providing the recurring revenue and cash flow necessary to support operations. The second, and now dominant, prong is the Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company uses cash flows from operations, as well as capital raised through equity and debt issuances, to acquire Bitcoin.\n\n### Bitcoin Treasury Strategy\n- 2025 Earnings Guidance: Operating income target of $34 billion, net income target of $24 billion, EPS target of $80\n- Strategy is reaffirming its 2025 Bitcoin KPI targets in light of strong execution and capital markets activity year-to-date, assuming a year-end 2025 Bitcoin price of $150,000\n- increasing 2025 \"BTC Yield\" target from 15% to 25%, and raising \"BTC $ Gain\" target from $10B to $15B\n\n### International Expansion\n- We are also actively laying the groundwork for credit securities in international jurisdictions, positioning Strategy to become a dominant credit issuer globally\n- Partnership with STACKIT: \"European MicroStrategy customers can use the MicroStrategy Sovereign European Cloud confident that their data is secure, compliant and providing value to the business through the insights we provide.\"\n\n---\n\n## Products & Services\n\n### Existing Software Products\n- **Strategy One:** A cloud-native platform that combines BI, data visualization, and AI\n- **Strategy Mosaic:** The platform is designed as an AI-powered Universal Intelligence Layer to unify disparate data sources.

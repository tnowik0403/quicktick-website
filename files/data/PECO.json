PECO refers to **PECO Energy Company**, a regulated electric and natural gas distribution utility operating as a **wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC)** since their 2001 merger (completed March 12, 2001). PECO does not issue separate financial reports or trade independently. All parent-level financials reference Exelon's latest filings. For investment exposure, use EXC (current price: $41.99 USD; market cap: $42.48B USD as of market close October 4, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg). No recent (past 6 months) PECO-specific earnings reports exist; quantitative data pulled from Exelon's Q2 2024 earnings (released July 30, 2024, 10-Q filed August 7, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPECO Energy Company is a leading regulated utility providing safe, reliable electric and natural gas distribution services to approximately 1.7 million electric customers and 550,000 natural gas customers across a 1,900-square-mile service territory in southeastern Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties). As part of Exelon, PECO focuses on infrastructure investment, grid resilience, and customer affordability amid the energy transition. The company operates as a natural monopoly under Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulation, delivering ~17 TWh of annual electricity and ~40 Bcf of gas (Exelon FY2023 data). Recent emphasis includes smart grid upgrades, EV infrastructure, and decarbonization efforts aligned with Pennsylvania's climate goals. PECO invests heavily in storm hardening post-events like Hurricane Ida (2021) and recent storms, with $1B+ annual capex. It supports economic growth via data center and manufacturing demand while managing affordability programs amid rising rates. Challenges include regulatory scrutiny on rate hikes and extreme weather vulnerabilities. PECO's stable, defensive profile benefits from inelastic demand, contributing ~15-20% to Exelon's utility segment earnings.

PECO's defensive monopoly and growth tailwinds (data centers, IRA) are offset by regulatory rate pressures, storm risks, and high utility valuations (EXC trades at 18x Fwd P/E vs. sector 16x). Limited upside for growth-oriented portfolios; better for income (EXC 3.8% yield).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $44-46/share for EXC (10-12% upside from $41.99; DCF-based using 7% growth to 2028, 9% ROE, per analyst consensus from FactSet/Visible Alpha as of Oct 4, 2024). Moderate risk appetite suits dividend stability over aggressive growth.",

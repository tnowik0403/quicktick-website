Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, RTX operates through three primary segments: Collins Aerospace (commercial and military avionics, interiors, and systems), Pratt & Whitney (commercial and military aircraft engines), and Raytheon (missiles, integrated defense systems, and cybersecurity). The company serves both commercial aviation (e.g., Boeing, Airbus) and defense markets (e.g., U.S. DoD, international militaries), with ~50% of revenue from U.S. government contracts. In 2023, RTX generated $68.9 billion in sales, employing ~185,000 people worldwide. Its portfolio emphasizes high-margin aftermarket services, which account for ~45% of revenues, providing recession-resistant cash flows. RTX is a top-tier player in defense electronics and propulsion, benefiting from geopolitical tensions and commercial air travel recovery post-COVID. Challenges include supply chain disruptions and engine recalls, but long-term tailwinds from defense budgets and sustainable aviation tech position it for mid-single-digit growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 22, 2024)**: Reported sales of $20.1 billion (+10% YoY), adjusted EPS of $1.45 (beat estimates by $0.07), and backlog of $217 billion (+11% YoY).

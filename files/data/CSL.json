Founded in 1916 as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, CSL has evolved into a multinational with ~27,000 employees across 40+ countries, generating revenue primarily from three segments: CSL Behring (78% of FY24 revenue; plasma protein therapies for immunology, hematology, cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory diseases), Seqirus (14%; world's second-largest influenza vaccine producer), and CSL Vifor (8%; specialty pharmaceuticals for iron deficiency and nephrology).  \n\nThe company's core strength lies in its vertically integrated plasma supply chain, collecting ~10 million liters annually from 300+ centers worldwide, enabling high-margin products like immunoglobulin therapies (e.g., Privigen, Hizentra). CSL's innovation pipeline focuses on gene therapies and novel biologics, supported by AUD 1.1 billion R&D spend in FY24. With a market-leading position in plasma fractionation (~28% global share), CSL benefits from structural demand tailwinds like aging populations and rising autoimmune/chronic disease prevalence. FY24 marked record revenue amid plasma supply recovery post-COVID, though offset by Seqirus softness. Strategically, CSL targets 8-10% annual revenue CAGR through capacity expansion and bolt-on M&A, positioning it as a defensive growth play in biotech.

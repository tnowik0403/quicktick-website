Founded in 1960 and headquartered in Camarillo, California, Semtech operates through two main segments: Signal Integrity (protection, timing, and isolation products) and Wireless and Sensing (LoRa connectivity, RFID, and edge AI). Its flagship LoRaWAN technology powers long-range, low-power wireless networks for smart cities, agriculture, and asset tracking, with over 20 million daily messages processed via The Things Network as of Sep 2024. Semtech serves a diverse customer base including hyperscalers, OEMs in telecom/auto, and edge device makers. Post-2023 Sierra Wireless acquisition ($1.2B), Semtech expanded into cellular modules (LTE-M/NB-IoT), bolstering end-to-end IoT solutions. With ~1,600 employees, Semtech reported Q2 FY25 revenue of $197.1M (up 2% QoQ, down 13% YoY), GAAP net loss of $58.6M, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.10.

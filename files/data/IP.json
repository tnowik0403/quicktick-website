Silvernail said during its May 2025 Investor Day: \"We're driving a winning mindset within the company. We are all about sustainable, differentiated packaging. You're going to see a strategy today that delivers excellence.\"\n\nA key element of International Paper's strategy is the implementation of an 80/20 performance system across its operations. Pilot programs have already shown promising results, with some box plants achieving a 20% productivity gain.\n\nThe company posted an update to its strategy at the end of 2025, stating that one of its greatest strengths is its footprint, having one of the \"most advantaged footprint in the industry\". To achieve this, the firm is focusing on high quality packaging, on-time delivery and rapid response times.\n\nIP aims for $26 billion to $28 billion in sales in 2027; it projects $27 billion in sales this year.\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n### 2024 Financial Results\nInternational Paper reported full-year 2024 net earnings of $557 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, and adjusted operating earnings (non-GAAP) of $400 million, or $1.13 per diluted share. Full-year net sales were $18.6 billion in 2024 and $18.9 billion in 2023.\n\nThe reported fourth quarter net loss was $147 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, and adjusted operating loss (non-GAAP) was $7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.6 billion in 2024 and 2023.\n\n### Dividend Policy\nInternational Paper Company maintains a consistent dividend policy, with a payout ratio exceeding 100% in 2024 and a dividend yield around 3.4%. The dividend per share has remained stable near $1.85, supported by moderate free cash flow coverage and capital expenditure.\n\n### Financial Challenges\nInternational Paper Company does not currently present a competitive advantage as its return on invested capital (ROIC) is significantly below its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), indicating value destruction and declining profitability. The company's ROIC trend over 2020-2024 is negative, reinforcing concerns about efficient capital use and long-term value creation.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n\"The North American team is facing headwinds that we didn't expect, but we're being aggressive with the realities of that. In Europe, it's been a tough market, no doubt about it.\" Specifically, \"the soft market has cost more than $500 million in profit this year alone.\"\n\nIP lowered its guidance for full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization due to ongoing weakness in North America and EMEA. The 2025 EBITDA projection is $3 billion, down from the April expectation of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Full-year box shipments are projected to be down 1% to 1.5% for 2025 instead of up by the same range as anticipated at the beginning of this year.\n\nWith the global economic outlook deteriorating –exacerbated by the Trump Administration's tariff policies – production and prices are expected to remain flat through 2025, with risks skewed to the downside. The deterioration of the economic outlook for 2025 triggered by US tariff policy and amid elevated uncertainty will translate into lower demand for paper packaging, and ultimately for paper pulp, bearing in mind that packaging captures about 70% of pulp production.\n\n### Tailwinds\nFor 2025, we expect revenues to recover by around +4.3% y/y, supported by the fact that destocking in many end-markets has ended and the belief that consumer e-spending should gradually start to improve as inflation has receded. Paper packaging: Despite softness across most paper sub-sectors in 2024, packaging remained resilient, with global capacity rising modestly by 3–4% y/y, and with demand increasing around +2% y/y. In 2025, the paper and paperboard packaging sub-sector is expected to continue growing, fueled by the rapid expansion of e-commerce and the ongoing transition from plastics in the food packaging segment.\n\nThe paper packaging market size reached USD 458.8 billion in 2025 and is projected to climb to USD 583.95 billion by 2030, reflecting a 4.94% CAGR. This expansion is propelled by environmental regulations that reward recyclable substrates, the continued rise of online retail, and rapid progress in bio-based barrier coatings that let paper compete with plastics on moisture and grease resistance.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nInternational Paper accounts for roughly one third of the North American corrugated packaging market. In 2024, International Paper achieved net sales of $18.6 billion and holds about a third of the North American corrugated packaging market.\n\nAt the end of 2024, the group had 214 production sites located mainly in the United States (176). In 2024, it led the packaging and container industry in revenue.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nKey direct rivals include Smurfit Westrock (SW), Amcor plc, Packaging Corporation of America (PCA), Mondi, Georgia-Pacific, Weyerhaeuser, and Domtar.\n\nInternational Paper Company, with a market cap of 21.3B, ranks among large peers such as Smurfit Westrock and Amcor plc, reflecting its significant presence in the packaging sector.\n\nSmurfit WestRock's trailing twelve month revenue is $31.1B. After the merger of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock in summer 2024, Smurfit WestRock became the largest producer of containerboard in the world, with substantial operations in North America, South America, and Europe.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### DS Smith Acquisition (2025)\nInternational Paper has completed its acquisition of DS Smith, in a deal that is estimated to be worth $7.2 billion. The companies expect to achieve at least $514 million in synergies, according an International Paper securities filing Friday.\n\nPursuant to the acquisition, IP will issue 0.1285 of new shares of common stock for each ordinary share of DS Smith, resulting in the issuance of approximately 179,847,780 new shares of IP common stock. It is expected that on February 4, 2025, the new shares of IP common stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"IP,\" and shares of IP common stock, including the shares of new IP common stock, will begin trading on the London Stock Exchange via a secondary listing under the symbol \"IPC.\"\n\n### Global Cellulose Fibers Divestiture\nInternational Paper has reached a definitive agreement with American Industrial Partners (AIP) to sell its Global Cellulose Fibers (GCF) business for $1.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, including the issuance of preferred stock with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $190 million.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Facility Closures and Restructuring\nThe Riceboro and Savannah mills will shut down in phases by the end of September 2025, and the Savannah packaging facility will also cease operations by the end of September. These combined changes will result in a net reduction of the company's annual containerboard capacity by approximately one million tons.\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn., Nov. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- International Paper (NYSE: IP; LSE: IPC) today announced the closure of its packaging facilities in Compton, California and Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n### Leadership\nAndrew Silvernail serves as CEO since May 1, 2024 and became chairman in October 2024.\n\n### Operational Performance\nSeptember box shipments were up 1% year over year, and that trend continued into October, said CFO Lance Loeffler.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Strengths:\n• **Market Leadership**: Dominant position with ~33% of North American corrugated packaging market\n• **Strategic Transformation**: Successful completion of $7.2B DS Smith acquisition creating global scale\n• **Sustainable Focus**: Strong positioning in growing sustainable packaging market ($458.8B growing to $583.95B by 2030)\n• **Operational Efficiency**: 80/20 system showing 20% productivity gains in pilot programs\n• **E-commerce Tailwinds**: Strong exposure to growing e-commerce packaging demand\n\n### Investment Concerns:\n• **Market Headwinds**: Significant downturn with $500M+ profit impact from soft markets\n• **Revised Guidance**: 2025 EBITDA cut from $3.5-4B to $3B\n• **Negative ROIC**: Return on invested capital below cost of capital indicating value destruction\n• **High Dividend Payout**: >100% payout ratio raising sustainability concerns\n• **Restructuring Costs**: Major facility closures and workforce reductions\n\n### Valuation Analysis:\nWith analyst price targets ranging from $36-$57.8 (consensus ~$47.35) and recent trading around $39-40, the stock appears to be in the lower end of the valuation range. The 52-week low of $35.56 suggests potential support, while the high of $60.15 indicates significant upside potential if operational improvements materialize.\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $45.00\n\n**Buy Rating: 6.2/10**\n\n**Investment Rationale**: International Paper represents a mixed investment opportunity. While the company faces near-term headwinds from weak market conditions and has concerning profitability metrics, the strategic DS Smith acquisition, focus on sustainable packaging, and strong market position provide medium-to-long-term upside potential. The significant operational transformation underway, combined with the growing e-commerce and sustainability trends, supports a cautiously optimistic outlook. However, investors should be prepared for continued volatility and potential dividend sustainability concerns until operational improvements translate into improved financial metrics. The stock appears fairly valued with moderate upside potential for patient investors willing to ride through the current restructuring phase.",

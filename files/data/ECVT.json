Headquartered in Houston, Texas, with key operations in Canada's Athabasca oil sands (McMurray and Wapasu lodges), Australia's Bowen Basin coal mines, and U.S. mobile camps, Civeo specializes in purpose-built lodges and modular camps for remote workforces. The company caters to oil sands producers, LNG projects, mining operations, and construction firms needing turnkey solutions for 100-5,000+ workers, including catering, housekeeping, laundry, Wi-Fi, recreation, and security.\n\nFounded in 2012 as a spin-off from Oil States International, Civeo has evolved from oil & gas focus to diversified energy/mining exposure. In Canada (75-80% revenue), it dominates oil sands with fixed lodges amid SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) activity. Australia (15-20%) targets coal/LNG, while U.S. (5-10%) offers mobile rentals. Q2 2024 earnings highlighted resilient demand: revenues of $164.7 million (+3% YoY), driven by Canadian occupancy at 94%. Management emphasizes cost discipline, debt reduction (net debt $57M), and organic growth via lodge expansions. Challenges include oil price volatility and labor shortages, but tailwinds from energy transition (e.g., carbon capture) and Australian LNG ramps position Civeo for mid-single-digit growth. With ~1,800 rooms in Canada/Australia, Civeo holds a niche leadership in high-end remote lodging, differentiating via scale, quality, and long-term contracts (avg. 3-5 years).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024 transcript, verified):** Revenues $164.7M (+3% YoY), Adjusted EBITDA $42.1M (margin 25.6%), Net Income $12.4M. Canadian segment revenue $130.3M (+5%), occupancy 94%; Australia $24.2M (+1%); U.S. $10.2M (-14%).

(VVOS) is a Denver-based medical technology company specializing in non-invasive, biomimetic oral appliances and therapies for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), snoring, and related dentofacial abnormalities in adults and children. Unlike traditional CPAP machines, Vivos' devices—such as the patented DNA (Daytime-Nighttime Appliance) and mRNA appliances—use pneumo-percussive transmission and biomimetic design to remodel and expand the upper airway through bone and soft tissue growth, promoting natural craniofacial development. The company operates via a provider network model, training dentists and physicians through its Vivos Integrated Provider Network (VIPN) of ~675 providers (as of Q2 2024). Revenue is generated from device sales, training programs (Vivos Education), and integrated treatment protocols. Targeting the $7B+ U.S. OSA market (growing 5-7% annually per Grand View Research 2024), Vivos positions itself as a patient-preferred alternative to surgery or CPAP, with clinical data showing 50-80% AHI reduction in studies (published in JDSM, 2023-2024).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue surged 173% YoY to $6.3M; gross margin 64% (up from 55% YoY); net loss $4.5M (improved from $6.1M YoY).

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nVerisk data, in conjunction with the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, indicated the insurance industry returned to profitability in 2024 with a $25 billion underwriting gain, the first in four years.\n\nSevere Weather Impact: 2024 was the second-worst year for catastrophic losses since 1950. 2025 began with devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, estimated to cause $28 billion to $35 billion in insurance losses. Verisk's analytics are crucial for clients navigating these complex risks.\n\n**Headwinds:**\nHowever, the industry faces ongoing challenges: inflation, regulatory changes, rising reconstruction costs, social inflation, and the impact of severe weather events.\n\nCompetitive Pricing in Insurance: While the industry saw profitability improvements in 2024, Verisk noted that pricing in commercial P&C and personal auto is becoming more competitive. This could lead to increased client focus on expenses, though Verisk has not observed a material impact on its business from these pricing trends so far, given the industry's general recovery.\n\nTougher Comparisons: The second half of 2025 will involve comparisons against strong, elevated subscription revenue growth in H2 2024, which included contract conversions. Federal Government Spending Cuts: A modest impact is expected from federal government spending cuts, anticipated to begin in the third quarter, although these contracts represent less than 1% of total revenue. Auto Business Softness: Persistent competitive pressures and customer mix are contributing to weakness in the auto business, which is expected to continue.\n\n## 9.

Verisk announced today that it has terminated its definitive agreement to purchase AccuLynx.\n\nData analytics firm Verisk said it pulled the plug on its planned $2.35 billion acquisition of roofing software maker AccuLynx, pinning the termination on a regulatory review delay.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nEqually transformative is Verisk's collaboration with Willis Towers Watson to embed ISO Electronic Rating Content into its Radar platform.

(NYSE: TGNA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nTEGNA Inc. is a leading U.S. media company focused on delivering local content across broadcast television, digital platforms, and connected TV (CTV). Headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, TEGNA owns and operates 64 television stations in 53 U.S. markets, including affiliates of NBC (19), CBS (12), FOX (8), and The CW (3), reaching approximately 39% of U.S. TV households. The company emphasizes hyper-local news, sports, and weather programming, supplemented by robust digital properties serving over 100 million monthly unique visitors via apps and websites. Key revenue streams include retransmission consent fees (subscription revenue from pay-TV providers), advertising (local and national spot, political), and digital/CTV through its Premion division, which specializes in local programmatic advertising.\n\nTEGNA has evolved from its legacy newspaper roots (spun off from Gannett in 2015) into a diversified local media powerhouse, prioritizing high-margin subscription revenue (53% of total) amid cord-cutting trends. With a focus on operational efficiency, content innovation, and digital expansion, TEGNA generated $1.54 billion in political advertising revenue in 2024's election cycle, bolstering profitability. The company serves as a critical information provider in its markets, leveraging first-party data and AI-driven tools for targeted advertising. Despite secular declines in linear TV viewership, TEGNA's scale, premium affiliate deals, and Premion's 20%+ YoY growth position it for resilient cash flows and shareholder returns via dividends (yield ~3%) and buybacks.

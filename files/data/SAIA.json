(SAIA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Date of Report:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $512.47 (NASDAQ close, October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $13.72 billion (October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $378.10 - $531.99  \n\n## Company Overview\nSaia Inc. is a leading less-than-truckload (LTL) freight carrier operating primarily in the United States, with a focus on regional and interregional transportation services. Founded in 1924 and headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia, Saia manages a network of 92 terminals across 44 states, enabling same-day, next-day, and expedited delivery for shipments averaging 400 pounds. The company serves a diverse customer base including manufacturing, wholesale/retail, chemicals, apparel, and food/beverage sectors, emphasizing high service quality, on-time delivery (97%+), and low claims ratios (<0.5%). Saia differentiates through its \"SaiaEdge\" technology for shipment tracking and customer portals, supporting e-commerce and just-in-time inventory needs. In recent years, Saia has aggressively expanded via organic terminal builds and acquisitions, growing from 68 terminals in 2020 to 92 today, with international reach into Mexico via partnerships. Revenue is driven by tonnage growth (5-10% annually pre-2024 slowdown), pricing discipline (3-5% annual increases), and operational efficiency, yielding industry-leading margins. Amid a freight recession, Saia maintains a debt-free balance sheet and high ROIC (>25%), positioning it for market share gains as capacity exits (e.g., Yellow Corp. bankruptcy in 2023).

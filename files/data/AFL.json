Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Insurance giant Aflac is notifying roughly 22.65 million people that their personal information was stolen from its systems in June 2025. Just before Christmas, the Columbus, Georgia-based company announced it had completed its investigation into the potentially compromised data and had started notifying the affected individuals. \"Based on our review of potentially impacted files, we have determined personal information associated with approximately 22.65 million individuals was involved,\" the company said.\n- Regulatory and Compliance Risks: Aflac Inc operates in a highly regulated environment, with stringent oversight from various governmental authorities. The complexity and ever-changing nature of these regulations pose a significant challenge, as compliance requires substantial resources and continuous vigilance. Any failure to adhere to these regulations could result in costly penalties, legal battles, and damage to the company's reputation. The proposed regulations in July 2023, if enacted, could materially affect Aflac U.S.'s sales, highlighting the vulnerability of the company's operations to regulatory changes.\n- Currency volatility affecting Japan operations\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The supplemental health insurance industry is experiencing significant growth, driven by rising healthcare costs and increasing consumer awareness of the need for additional coverage.\n- Strong brand recognition with the Aflac Duck\n- The company takes pride in being there for its policyholders when they need us most, as well as being included in the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for 18 consecutive years (2024), Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 23 years (2024) and Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year (2023). In addition, the company became a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2021 and has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (2023) for 10 years.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket share in the USA: 5% (estimated for 2025) Market share in Japan: 25% (estimated for 2025). Aflac Incorporated is particularly known for its supplemental insurance, especially in the USA and Japan.\n\nWith a 27% market share, the company sees plenty of room to grow in the US supplemental health insurance market, while Aflac is practically synonymous with \"cancer insurance\" in Japan, holding a massive market share.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nAflac's main competitors include Old Mutual, Manulife, Prudential, MetLife, Allstate and Colonial Life. In Q1 2025, MetLife led with a 43.39% market share, closely followed by Prudential Financial at 35.64%. As of Q1 2025, MetLife Inc. secured a substantial 43.39% market share in its competitive arena. This places it ahead of key industry rivals such as Prudential Financial Inc., which holds 35.64%, and Lincoln National Corporation with 11.23%.\n\nAflac's moat lies in its strong brand recognition and specialization in supplemental insurance, providing the company with a niche where there is less direct competition. Compared to other companies, Aflac has a moderate moat. While MetLife and Prudential Financial have a stronger moat due to their comprehensive product range and global presence, Aflac benefits from its specialization and ability to quickly respond to market changes.\n\n## 11.

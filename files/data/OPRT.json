Founded in 2005 and headquartered in San Carlos, California, Oportun operates a fully digital lending platform that uses proprietary AI-driven underwriting models to assess creditworthiness based on over 400 data points, including alternative data like utility payments and bank account behavior, rather than relying solely on FICO scores. The company primarily offers personal loans (average size ~$3,000-$7,000) with APRs of 20-36%, targeting thin-file or credit-invisible borrowers (FICO <660). In recent years, Oportun has diversified beyond loans into credit cards (launched Oportun Credit Card in October 2023) and is piloting banking products like checking accounts. It originates loans directly and through retail partners (e.g., Walmart, Sam's Club). As of Q2 2024, Oportun has served over 4 million customers since inception, with a focus on Spanish-language support (40%+ of customers are Hispanic). The company emphasizes financial inclusion, boasting high customer satisfaction (NPS ~70) and repeat borrowing rates >50%. Revenue is driven by interest income (90%+), fees, and servicing. OPRT went public via IPO in September 2021 at $12/share but has faced post-IPO challenges from rising rates and credit normalization.

Founded in 1968 and headquartered in New Hampshire, PAR specializes in point-of-sale (POS) systems, enterprise software platforms, and back-office solutions that enable efficient order management, payments, inventory control, and customer loyalty programs. Its flagship offerings, including the PAR Brink POS platform and Punchh customer engagement software, serve over 30,000 restaurant locations globally, with a heavy focus on major QSR chains. PAR has transitioned from legacy on-premise hardware sales to a high-margin, recurring revenue model via Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), achieving Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth exceeding 40% YoY in recent quarters. The company derives ~50% of revenue from McDonald's, underscoring its deep entrenchment in the world's largest QSR operator. PAR's solutions integrate seamlessly with third-party delivery (e.g., DoorDash, Uber Eats) and drive-thru technologies, capitalizing on the $400B+ U.S. restaurant tech market. Amid digital transformation in hospitality, PAR positions itself as a mission-critical partner, emphasizing scalability, AI-driven analytics, and omnichannel capabilities to boost restaurant throughput and profitability.

Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, OppFi operates a proprietary AI- and machine learning-driven platform that facilitates personal loans, credit cards, and other financial products through partnerships with federally insured banks. Its flagship product, OppLoans, provides installment loans ranging from $500-$4,000 with terms up to 18 months, emphasizing transparent pricing and financial literacy tools.\n\nThe company went public via SPAC merger with FG New America Acquisition Corp on January 21, 2021. OppFi's model leverages bank partnerships to originate loans compliant with state regulations, avoiding direct lending restrictions. It has expanded beyond loans into the OppFi Card (a credit-building Mastercard launched in 2023) and SalaryTap (employer-integrated advances). Serving over 3 million customers historically, OppFi targets the $40B+ underserved personal lending market, where traditional banks under-serve 45 million Americans.

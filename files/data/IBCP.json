All quantitative financials from verified Q3 2024 earnings (Oct 24, 2024 release, <6 months old). Stock data as of Nov 8, 2024 close: **Price: $35.12**, **Market Cap: $1.04B** (52-week range: $26.04-$37.56).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nIndependent Bank Corporation (IBCP) is a Michigan-based bank holding company headquartered in Grand Rapids, operating Independent Bank, a community-focused financial institution serving businesses, professionals, and individuals primarily in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. With ~70 branches across 15 counties, IBCP offers a full suite of banking products, emphasizing commercial real estate (CRE) lending (40%+ of portfolio), commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, consumer/residential mortgages, and deposit services. The bank also provides wealth management via Independent Wealth Management and insurance through First Community Insurance. As of Q3 2024, total assets stood at $6.8B, loans at $4.3B, and deposits at $5.9B, reflecting a conservative balance sheet with a CET1 capital ratio of 11.5%. IBCP has evolved from regional expansion (post-2007 crisis mergers) to organic growth, prioritizing relationship banking in underserved markets. It benefits from Michigan's stable economy (auto, manufacturing, agriculture) but faces CRE concentration risks amid national rate pressures. Recent efficiency drives have boosted ROE to 12.5% TTM, positioning it as a mid-tier regional player with strong local deposit franchise (loan-to-deposit ratio ~73%).

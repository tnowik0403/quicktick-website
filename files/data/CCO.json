Daily Volume (3-mo): 1.52 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCameco Corporation (TSX: CCO) is one of the world's largest publicly traded uranium companies, focused on the full nuclear fuel cycle. Headquartered in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, Cameco mines, refines, and markets uranium concentrate (U3O8), converts it into uranium hexafluoride (UF6), and fabricates fuel assemblies for nuclear reactors. It operates high-grade, low-cost tier-1 assets, including the McArthur River/Key Lake complex (world's largest high-grade uranium mine, ~18% of global production capacity when fully ramped) and Cigar Lake (highest-grade mine globally). Cameco also provides nuclear fuel services via its Fuel Services division and holds a 49% stake in Westinghouse Electric Company (acquired 2023), a leading nuclear technology firm servicing reactors worldwide.\n\nThe company benefits from surging global nuclear demand driven by decarbonization, energy security, and AI/data center power needs. In 2023, Cameco produced ~23.5 million lbs U3O8 equivalent. It employs ~2,800 people and emphasizes ESG leadership, with low carbon intensity mining. Recent uranium spot prices (~USD 80/lb as of Oct 2024) support strong margins, positioning Cameco for multi-year growth amid supply deficits projected to 2030+.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue CAD 741M (up 21% YoY), adjusted EBITDA CAD 197M (up from CAD 70M), net earnings CAD 24M or CAD 0.05/share (from loss).

Bullish for growth portfolios.)\n- **Fair Value Estimate: CAD 85** (30% upside; DCF-based on USD 75/lb long-term U3O8, 25M lbs prod 2025+, 15x EV/EBITDA.

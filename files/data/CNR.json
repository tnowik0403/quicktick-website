Founded in 1919 and headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, CN transports approximately 300 million tons of freight annually, making it a critical backbone for North American supply chains. Its core business revolves around freight rail services, with key commodities including intermodal containers (35-40% of volumes), grain & fertilizers (15-20%), petroleum & chemicals (10-15%), metals & minerals (10%), forest products (8-10%), coal (5-7%), and automotive (5%). CN's network advantages include direct access to major ports (Vancouver, Prince Rupert, Halifax, New Orleans), agricultural heartlands, and industrial hubs, enabling efficient long-haul transport. The company employs ~25,000 people and focuses on operational efficiency through Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), which prioritizes scheduled trains, asset utilization, and velocity to drive margins. In 2023, CN generated CAD 17.1 billion in revenue, with a focus on sustainable growth amid rail sector consolidation. CN differentiates via its coast-to-coast Canadian footprint (complemented by U.S. extensions) and investments in technology like AI-driven dispatching and terminal automation. Recent challenges include wildfires and labor disputes, but CN remains a defensive infrastructure play with strong free cash flow (CAD 3.5B+ annually) supporting dividends (yield ~2.0%) and buybacks.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- BG's weak performance is mainly due to pressures from cyclical commodities, geopolitical trade tensions, and integration challenges.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha claimed on 6 January 2026 that the attack was not accidental and he assessed that Russia was systematically attacking American businesses in Ukraine.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Soy and sugar prices are expected to rise.\n- Increasing global population and changing dietary patterns, driving demand for sustainable and nutritious food products.\n- with the Viterra integration enhancing global operations and creating operational synergies.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Global Market Position:**\nADM (Archer Daniels Midland), Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus collectively control 50-60% of international trade in wheat, corn, and soybeans... Experts estimate that Cargill's turnover is 217 million tons, Bunge – 142 million tons, ADM – 100 million tons, Dreyfus – 83 million tons.\n\nThe Big Five control between 70 and 90 per cent of the global trade in commercial grains...

With an immense hold over production and distribution, Cargill arguably is the global food system.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nJust 10 years ago, the share of these four companies in the global market was 70-90%, but they were pushed by new competitors, primarily by the Chinese giant Cofco International (CIL), which sold 127 million tons of grains, oilseeds, and fruits in 2022... The Big Four are fighting with new competitors, trying to absorb them, and expanding their business areas, including biofuels, edible oils, animal feed, and food products.

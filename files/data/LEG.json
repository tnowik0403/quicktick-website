The company operates through three main segments: Bedding Products (fabrication and distribution of bedding components like innersprings, wire forms, and adjustable beds, serving ~1,200 North American customers); Furniture Products (mechanical controls, mechanisms, and lumber for recliners, sofas, and office seating); and Specialized Products (automotive seating components like lumbar supports and seat motors, plus hydraulic cylinders for agriculture, lawn/garden, and aerospace). With ~20,000 employees and manufacturing in 18 countries, LEG generates ~85% of sales in North America. Historically a Dividend King (53+ years of increases), it yields ~4.0% trailing. Recent strategic shifts focus on portfolio simplification amid housing softness and auto volatility, including a planned separation into two pure-plays by H1 2025. FY2023 sales were ~$4.8B, but Q2 2024 reflected cyclical pressures (verified below). LEG's moat lies in scale, customer relationships (e.g., major bed-in-a-box brands), and innovation in comfort tech, positioning it as a backbone supplier in fragmented markets.

EPS $1.20-1.40.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (**Hold**) – Attractive spin-off catalyst and 4% yield for income, but near-term earnings weakness and housing/auto risks cap upside. Moderate growth upside (~20-30% to fair value) suits moderate risk; wait for Q3 Oct 29 earnings dip for entry.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $16.50 (DCF post-spin: 10x 2025E EPS $1.60 for new LEG + Home stub value; aligns with sum-of-parts Barclays note Sep 2024). Implies ~33% upside.",

Potential: NJ solar firms via new loans.\n- **Qualitative:** Strong management tenure (CEO >20 yrs); community ties (e.g., chamber sponsorships); ESG focus on local development.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold to Buy)**  \n  Rationale: Solid fundamentals (top-tier ROA/NIM), dividend yield, CRE resilience amid sector woes. Growth upside from SBA/digital, but moderate CRE risk caps to \"Hold\" for conservative; \"Buy\" for growth seekers. Undervalued at 1.05x TBV (peer avg 1.10x).\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $24.50** (20% upside)  \n  Based on 12x 2024 EPS fwd ($2.80 est. from Q3 guidance + analyst consensus on Yahoo/Seeking Alpha), 1.15x TBV ($21.25 Q3 book), DCF at 10% discount (conservative for moderate risk). Strong growth potential if rates stabilize. Target 12-18 months.",

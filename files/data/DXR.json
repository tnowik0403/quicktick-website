Founded in 1970 and headquartered in New York, NY, Daxor focuses on critical care applications, particularly for heart failure, hypertension, surgery, and sepsis management. The BVA-100 uses a patented indicator dilution technology with I-131 albumin, offering precision (±2.5% accuracy) superior to indirect methods like weight-based formulas or central venous pressure, which can be off by 20-30%. This enables clinicians to optimize fluid management, reducing hospital readmissions, lengths of stay, and costs—key in an era of value-based care. Daxor operates a CLIA-certified lab for sample analysis and deploys analyzers via rental, lease, or sale models to hospitals and clinics. With over 55,000 tests performed, the company targets expansion in the $10B+ U.S. heart failure diagnostics market, where poor fluid management contributes to 1M+ annual hospitalizations. Recent regulatory wins and clinical data underscore its potential to disrupt standard practices, positioning Daxor as a niche leader in precision diagnostics amid rising chronic disease prevalence.

Undervalued at 4x 2025 sales est. ($20M rev.); path to $50M rev. by 2027 (40% CAGR) via adoption.

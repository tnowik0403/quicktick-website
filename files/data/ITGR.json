Operating through two primary segments—Medical (89% of Q3 2024 revenue) and Electrochem (11%)—the company serves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in high-growth areas such as cardiac rhythm management (CRM), neuromodulation, orthopedics & spine, vascular interventions, and advanced surgical markets. Its Medical segment provides critical interconnect systems, capacitors, introducers, handles, leads, sensors, and battery systems, while Electrochem delivers customized battery and power solutions for implantable medical devices, portable medical products, and non-medical applications like energy, military, and environmental markets.\n\nFounded in 1970 (as Greatbatch, Inc., rebranded Integer in 2016), ITGR operates 28 facilities worldwide, with ~11,000 employees. The company benefits from a vertically integrated model, stringent regulatory compliance (ISO 13485, FDA-registered), and innovation in MRI-compatible and low-power components. In Q3 2024 (ended Sep 29), revenue reached $466.0 million (up 9.2% YoY), driven by 10.4% organic growth in Medical, offset by Electrochem softness. ITGR's strategy emphasizes medtech outsourcing trends, where OEMs like Medtronic and Abbott increasingly rely on contract manufacturers for complex components amid rising R&D costs and supply chain pressures. With a $4.2 billion backlog (as of Q3 2024), strong free cash flow ($65M in Q3), and a history of accretive M&A, Integer is positioned for sustained growth in a $500B+ global medtech market expanding at 5-7% CAGR.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Nov 6, 2024)**: Revenue $466.0M (+9.2% YoY);

Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMarriott's diverse portfolio serves various customer segments:\n\n- **Business Travelers:** Through brands like Courtyard by Marriott, Marriott Hotels, and Sheraton\n- **Luxury Travelers:** Via The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and JW Marriott\n- **Leisure Travelers:** Across all segments, particularly through resort properties\n- **Extended-Stay Guests:** Through Residence Inn and Element Hotels\n- **Group and Convention Business:** Large-scale meetings and events across multiple brands\n\nGroup remained the standout customer segment, with global group RevPAR rising 10 percent in the quarter and on pace to rise 8 percent for full year 2024. RevPAR for the business transient segment continued to grow nicely in the quarter, while leisure transient RevPAR was flat year over year, but still well ahead of pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Results:**\nBase management and franchise fees totaled $1,128 million in the 2024 fourth quarter, a 10 percent increase compared to base management and franchise fees of $1,026 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to RevPAR increases and unit growth, as well as higher residential and co-branded credit card fees.\n\nIn the 2024 fourth quarter, worldwide RevPAR increased 5.0 percent (a 5.0 percent increase using actual dollars) compared to the 2023 fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, worldwide RevPAR rose 5 percent, driven by gains in both ADR and occupancy.\n\nFull year global RevPAR rose 4.3 percent and, with record gross room additions of over 123,000, net rooms grew 6.8 percent to over 1.7 million rooms worldwide at year-end.\n\nFor the full year 2024, Marriott returned over $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, showcasing the strength of its asset-light business model and disciplined capital deployment.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- While near-term uncertainty exists, the long-term outlook for group business is positive, driven by strong pace for 2026 bookings.\n- International RevPAR increased by more than 7 percent, with APEC and EMEA leading the way and benefiting from strong leisure demand.\n- The Marriott Media Network and the expanding ecosystem of travel services (yachts, homes, villas) represent significant long-term opportunities for incremental revenue and profit growth.\n- Strong development pipeline with record signings\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Despite its global presence, Marriott's operations are still heavily reliant on the North American market, which comprises 63% of its total rooms. This concentration poses a risk of market saturation and vulnerability to regional economic downturns.\n- To maintain its competitive edge, Marriott is committed to significant capital and technology investments, which are projected to total approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year 2024. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they also strain the company's cash flow and could impact its financial flexibility, especially in a challenging economic environment.\n- Marriott faces stiff competition from other hotel chains, boutique hotels, and alternative lodging options like Airbnb. The evolving consumer preferences and the rise of technology-driven disruptors necessitate continuous innovation and adaptation. Marriott must stay ahead of industry trends and consumer expectations to maintain its market leadership and avoid losing market share to agile competitors.\n\n## 9.

(NASDAQ: MAR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Current Stock Price:** $262.35 (as of market close January 15, 2026, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $94.2 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, shares outstanding ~359 million)  \n**52-Week Range:** $210.43 - $285.67  \n**Sources:** Real-time searches via Google, Yahoo Finance, Marriott Investor Relations, Seeking Alpha, Bloomberg, Reuters, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q3 2025 via Seeking Alpha), recent news (CNN Business, WSJ, Dec 2025-Jan 2026).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMarriott International, Inc. (MAR) is the world's largest hotel company by room count, operating an asset-light business model focused on franchising, management, and licensing fees rather than owning properties. As of Q3 2025 earnings (reported October 29, 2025), Marriott oversees approximately 8,948 properties with 1.66 million rooms across 30 brands in 141 countries and territories. Key brands span luxury (Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis), premium (JW Marriott, Marriott Hotels), select-service (Courtyard, Residence Inn), and extended-stay (TownePlace Suites), catering to leisure, business, and group travelers.\n\nThe company's revenue is primarily fee-based: 65% from franchise fees, 25% from management fees, and the rest from owned/leased incentives and other sources. Marriott Bonvoy, its loyalty program with over 210 million members (Q3 2025), drives 55% of room nights and high-margin ancillary revenue via co-branded credit cards (e.g., Chase Marriott Bonvoy cards generating $1.2B in fees annually). Post-Starwood acquisition (2016), Marriott has expanded globally, with 45% of rooms in the U.S., 25% in Asia-Pacific, and growing presence in the Middle East/Africa.\n\nIn 2025, MAR reported resilient RevPAR growth amid travel recovery, benefiting from leisure demand and international expansion. However, it faces macroeconomic pressures like inflation and geopolitical risks. The development pipeline stands at 590,000 rooms (Q3 2025), signaling 5-7% annual net room growth.

(KDP) is a premier North American beverage platform, headquartered in Burlington, MA, with ~27,000 employees. Formed via the 2018 merger of Keurig Green Mountain (coffee systems) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (soft drinks), KDP spans two core segments: U.S. Coffee (~36% of FY2024 revenue) and U.S. Refreshment Beverages (~64%).  \n\nIn Coffee, KDP dominates single-serve brewing with Keurig brewers (15M+ units sold cumulatively) and K-Cup pods (market leader at ~40% U.S. share), emphasizing convenience and variety (e.g., Starbucks, Dunkin' partnerships). Refreshment Beverages features a portfolio of 125+ brands, including #1 Dr Pepper (cherry-flavored soda), Snapple teas, Canada Dry ginger ale, Bai antioxidants, Core hydration, and emerging RTD coffee like Stumptown.  \n\nKDP generates ~$15B annual revenue (FY2024: $14.81B per 10-K filed Feb 28, 2025), focusing on at-home consumption, health trends, and sustainability (e.g., 100% recyclable K-Cups by 2025 goal met early). It leverages a direct-store-delivery (DSD) network for 70% of Refreshment sales, serving supermarkets, convenience stores, and e-commerce. Amid post-COVID shifts, KDP targets premiumization, cold brew expansion, and pod recycling to drive 3-5% organic growth. Challenges include coffee cost volatility and declining brewer sales, but tailwinds from easing inflation and RTD coffee boom position it for steady mid-single-digit EPS growth.

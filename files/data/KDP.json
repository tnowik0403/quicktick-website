Financial Data & Performance\n\n### 2024 Full Year Results\nConstant currency net sales growth of 4%, led by U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments. Adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8%, marking a second consecutive year of sequential acceleration. Strong operating cash flow growth of 67% to $2.2 billion and free cash flow growth of 82% to $1.7 billion, supporting balanced capital allocation.\n\nNet Sales reached $15,351 million, reflecting a 3.6% increase from the prior year, driven by volume/mix growth and favorable net price realization.\n\n### Q4 2024 Performance\nFull Year Revenue Growth: Constant currency net sales grew approximately 4%. Full Year EPS Growth: EPS increased by 8%. Q4 Revenue Growth: Constant currency net sales increased more than 6%. Q4 US Refreshment Beverages Sales Growth: Net sales grew 10.3%.

The company reported operating income growth in the high single digits and a 6% increase in EPS, supported by productivity and cost discipline.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n• U.S. coffee segment faced challenges with a 3.6% decline in net revenue and a 7.2% drop in operating income due to persistent category promotions and pricing pressures. The consumer environment remains dynamic, with still beverage categories under pressure, reflecting current consumer softness.\n• Supply chain disruptions, including increased costs for raw materials, packaging, and transportation. Management acknowledges the challenges posed by inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and competitive dynamics.\n• Coffee, cocoa, and sugar prices remain sensitive to global supply shifts. Any production challenges in major growing regions can raise costs for beverage and confectionery manufacturers.\n\n### Tailwinds\n• KDP's 2025 strategy emphasizes diversification, including growth in the energy drink sector.\n• Energy remains one of the fastest growing categories within LRB, close to a double-digit mark over the last three years. I think there remains lots of opportunity to continue to offer differentiated brands that hit unique demand spaces and unique targets. We also like the profitability of the energy category, because it really helps to fund high-quality long-term brand building.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Overall Beverage Market Position\nKeurig Dr Pepper was the third soft drink brand with a $45.57 billion market cap. Pepsi ranks second, followed by Keurig Dr Pepper.

As of Q2 2025, PepsiCo held a 53.31% market share in nonalcoholic beverages, substantially larger than Coca-Cola's 27.35%.\n\nKDP carves out a distinct niche as a competitor, offering a different kind of refreshment experience. Formed in 2018 through the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, KDP presents a unique challenge to Coca-Cola. KDP's strength lies in its diversified portfolio that extends beyond traditional sodas.\n\nCoca-Cola remains the world's most valuable soft drink brand with a market cap of $298.58 billion as of March 18, 2025. PepsiCo is second at $205.32 billion.\n\n## 11.

Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, the company operates through two main segments: Garden Products (55-60% of sales) and Pet Products (40-45%). Garden offerings include grass seed (Pennington brand, ~#1 U.S. market share), fertilizers, wild bird feed, live plants, and pest control. Pet products encompass aquarium supplies (Aqueon, Fluval – leading in fish care), dog/cat treats/toys (Nylabone, TFH), reptile environments (Zoo Med), and horse care items. CENTA sells via major retailers (e.g., Walmart, Home Depot, Petco, Amazon), independent stores, and e-commerce, avoiding direct retail ownership. With ~6,300 employees and FY2023 revenue of ~$3.3B, it focuses on innovation, brand strength, and category leadership in fragmented markets. Recent challenges include pet segment softness amid reduced discretionary spending, offset by garden recovery post-weather disruptions.

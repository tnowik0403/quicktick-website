The company focuses on designing, building, marketing, and selling single-family detached and attached homes, multi-family residences, and urban rental properties under brands like Taylor Morrison and William Lyon Homes (acquired in 2020). TMHC emphasizes quality construction, innovative designs, and customer-centric features such as smart home tech, energy efficiency, and personalization options. It also engages in land acquisition, development, and financial services like mortgage origination via Taylor Morrison Home Finance. In FY2023, TMHC delivered 11,856 homes with an average closing price of ~$686K, targeting move-up and luxury buyers but pivoting toward entry-level and first-time buyers amid affordability challenges. The company benefits from a land-light strategy (owned/controlled lots for 3.1+ years of supply) and strong balance sheet (net debt-to-capital ~20%), positioning it for resilience in a cyclical industry driven by housing shortages and demographic demand.

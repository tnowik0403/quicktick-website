Company Overview\n\nNextpower Inc. provides solar tracker technologies and solutions for utility-scale and distributed generation solar applications in the United States and internationally. The company was originally established in 2014 as Nextracker, Inc. On November 12, 2025, it rebranded as Nextpower to reflect its transformation from solar tracking to energy technology for utility-scale and distributed generation solar power plants.\n\nThe company engineers advanced technologies that unify structural, electrical, and digital layers to optimize clean energy generation, control, and reliability. From solar tracking and power electronics to AI-driven automation and intelligent control software, Nextpower enables the speed, resilience, and intelligence to power the electrification of everything. That expansion could turn it into a \"one-stop shop\" for solar power plants. With over 150 GW of trackers under fulfilment or operational across more than 45 countries worldwide, the company has achieved 26% of the solar tracking systems market in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie, putting it in first place ahead of Arctech Solar, Gamechange Solar, PV Hardware, and Array Technologies.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Tracker Technologies:**\n- NX Horizon: a solar tracking solution; NX Horizon-XTR: a terrain-following tracker for sloped and challenging terrain; NX Horizon Hail Pro: automatic stowing using weather service information; NX Horizon Low Carbon: reduced carbon footprint solution\n- TrueCapture: energy yield management system; NX Anchor: solar tracker foundation system; NX Truss Driver: advanced installation equipment; NX Navigator: monitoring, controlling, and protecting solar projects\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n- In 2024, the company introduced tracker technology that uses weather-forecasting data and AI to automatically adjust solar panel angles into a stow mode ahead of hailstorms. The product was developed to mitigate the rising cost of insuring solar arrays from hail and other weather-related damage.\n- The company's software monitors weather conditions, checks for blind spots, and directs the position of individual rows of solar panels to optimize energy yield. A new tracking function added in 2023 adjusts trackers in response to variations in cloud cover across an entire power plant.\n\n**Manufacturing Capacity:**\n- As of March 31, 2024, the company's total global manufacturing capacity was approximately 1,000 MW per week, and supported up to 50 GW of annual shipments.\n- The company expanded to more than 20 U.S. manufacturing lines in Texas, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Tennessee, and Nevada between January 2021 and August 2024.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI and Robotics Division:**\n- In 2025, the company established an artificial intelligence and robotics division following three acquisitions in the sector and appointed Francesco Borrelli as its first Chief AI and Robotics Officer.\n- Dr. Francesco Borrelli, a professor at UC Berkeley, to lead the new unit as its first Chief AI and Robotics Officer.\n\n**Manufacturing Expansion:**\n- A new advanced manufacturing facility in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The factory was under construction and was expected to open in the second quarter of 2026 with an annual production capacity of up to 12 gigawatts.\n- This project involved an investment of around $88 million and was projected to create up to 2,000 jobs.\n\n**Technology Integration:**\n- These systems will complement Nextpower's existing products -- including its structural hardware, electrical balance-of-systems (eBOS) solutions, and AI-enabled digital tools.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nFrom fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nextpower's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 14% to $4.35 billion, its adjusted EBITDA to increase at a CAGR of 10% to $1.03 billion, and its net income to rise at a CAGR of 10% to $669 million. The company's evolution into a one-stop shop for integrated energy solutions, along with the ongoing expansion of the solar energy market and additional acquisitions, is expected to drive steady growth.\n\n**Strategic Transformation:**\n- To capitalize on the solar market's secular growth, Nextpower acquired more companies to support its aforementioned transformation and rebranding, formed a joint venture (Nextpower Arabia) to support its expansion into the Middle East and North Africa, opened a Southeast regional hub in Nashville, and doubled its domestic solar tracker fabrication capacity. Its investments in domestic manufacturing should reduce its dependence on imported components, insulate it from tariffs, and allow it to earn more clean-energy tax credits.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Client Base:**\n- The company serves engineering, procurement, and construction firms, as well as solar project developers and owners.\n\n**Key Partnerships:**\n- Nextracker announced a multiyear agreement valued at over $75 million with a leading U.S. solar panel manufacturer for its advanced module frame technology.\n- The company recently announced a multiyear agreement with a U.S. module manufacturer for $75 million to supply multi-gigawatt volumes of Nextracker's advanced module frame technology.\n\n**Geographic Focus:**\n- Its systems are especially popular in sunny regions, such as the Southwest U.S., the Middle East, India, and Latin America.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Financial Results (Q2 FY2026):**\n- In 2024, Nextpower's revenue was $2.96 billion, an increase of 18.38% compared to the previous year's $2.50 billion. Earnings were $509.17 million, an increase of 66.26%.\n- During Nextracker's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Call, the company reported robust financial performance with a 42% year-over-year revenue increase to $905 million and a 29% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $224 million. For the first half of fiscal 2026, revenue reached $1.77 billion, up 31% from the previous year, marking a record first half for the company.\n\n**Guidance (FY 2026):**\n- Revenue projected at $3.275 billion to $3.475 billion for fiscal 2026; adjusted EBITDA forecasted at $775 million to $815 million for fiscal 2026; adjusted diluted EPS expected at $4.04 to $4.25 for fiscal 2026.\n\n**Financial Position:**\n- Closed the quarter with $845 million in cash, no debt and total liquidity of nearly $1.8 billion, including a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with investment-grade terms.\n- The company achieved record bookings in electrical balance of system (eBOS) products and foundations, and reported a growing backlog of over $5 billion.\n\n**Profitability Metrics:**\n- Profitability metrics reveal that Nextpower Inc. boasts commendable returns on assets (13.72%) and equity (190.29%). Such figures signal effective asset utilization and shareholder wealth maximization.\n- Nextpower Inc. EBITDA is $739.45 M USD, and current EBITDA margin is 22.05%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The adoption of sustainable renewable energy technologies aimed at carbon emission mitigation will promote further market development. For example, in 2024, RP Construction Services and Array Technologies installed more than 6 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in North America.\n- New decarbonization initiatives, more generous government incentives, and cheaper solar modules all generated strong tailwinds for Nextpower's business.\n- U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic-content incentives now reward 100% American-made steel and motors, pushing manufacturers to reshore production and compress lead times.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- One of the key challenges in the solar tracker market is the relatively high upfront investment. Trackers require more complex structures and moving components compared to fixed-tilt systems, raising installation and maintenance expenses. In cost-sensitive markets, this can limit adoption despite long-term efficiency gains. Additionally, higher operational and maintenance requirements in harsh environments often discourage developers.\n\n**Legal Challenges:**\n- In late 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed against the company and several of its executives, including Dan Shugar, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws, asserting that the company and its leadership made materially false or misleading statements during the class period, which allegedly led to investor losses. The lawsuit claims that the defendants, including Shugar, failed to disclose adverse facts about the company's business and operations.\n\n## 9.

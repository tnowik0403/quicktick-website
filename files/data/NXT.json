(NXT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $48.25\n- Market Capitalization: $7.35 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $29.06 - $60.32\n- Avg. Daily Volume (3 months): 2.8 million shares\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 15.2x\n- EV/EBITDA: 12.8x\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNextracker Inc. (NXT) is a leading global provider of intelligent solar tracker, software, and balance-of-systems solutions for utility-scale and distributed solar projects. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Fremont, California, the company designs and manufactures single-axis solar trackers that optimize energy production by dynamically adjusting panel angles to track the sun, boosting yield by 15-25% over fixed-tilt systems. Its flagship products include the NX Horizon and TrueTracker systems, integrated with proprietary software like NX Navigator for site-specific performance modeling and NX Control for real-time operations.\n\nNextracker serves the explosive growth in solar energy, particularly in the U.S., where it benefits from Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives like domestic content tax credits. The company operates a global footprint with manufacturing in the U.S., India, Australia, and Europe, shipping over 65 GW cumulatively. In FY24 (ended March 31, 2024), it generated $2.3 billion in revenue, with ~90% from trackers. Nextracker went public via IPO in February 2023 at $23/share and has since captured significant market share amid surging utility-scale solar deployments (U.S. added 32 GWdc in 2023 per SEIA). Its backlog exceeds $3.9 billion, providing multi-year visibility in a market projected to grow at 20%+ CAGR through 2030, driven by net-zero goals and cost declines in modules/storage.

Revenue CAGR +15% projected (analyst consensus via Seeking Alpha), but execution risks high.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric | SLND | Tasly Pharma (1530.HK) | Infinitus (China) | Zynerba (ZNBP, delisted peer) |\n|--------|------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Mcap** | $14M | $5B | Private (~$1B est.) | N/A |\n| **Rev (TTM)** | $3.1M | $2.5B | $3B est. | N/A |\n| **Gross Margin** | 28% (Q1'25) | 65% | 50% | N/A |\n| **Key Edge** | Niche biotech IP | Scale/distribution | MLM network | N/A |\n| **Risks** | Illiquidity | Reg exposure | Private opacity | N/A |\n\nPeers highlight SLND's microcap underdog status; lags in scale but competitive on purity tech.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**:\n  - Yunnan Agricultural Bureau (June 2024): Joint farming for 500 mu Tianma.\n  - Alibaba/Tmall (ongoing): E-commerce exclusive for supplements.\n  - JD Health: Distribution since 2023.\n- **M&A**: None recent.

Analyst coverage: 1 firm (Benchmark: Spec Buy, $10 PT from 2023, outdated).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10** (Hold/Sell bias). Limited near-term catalysts amid losses/revenue weakness; high volatility (beta 2.1) exceeds moderate risk appetite. Growth upside hinges on R&D execution, but microcap illiquidity and China risks cap appeal.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $5.50 (72% upside). DCF-based (15% discount rate, 15% rev CAGR to 2028, 5x EV/Sales terminal multiple aligned with peers). Assumes Q1'25 fundamentals + strategy delivery; stop-loss at $2.00. Suitable for high-conviction growth portfolios only.",

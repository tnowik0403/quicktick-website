(PTGX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $30.42\n- Market Capitalization: $2.82 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $14.11 - $37.86\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nProtagonist Therapeutics, Inc. (PTGX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the discovery, development, and commercialization of orally delivered peptide-based therapeutics targeting unmet needs in hematology and gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Newark, California, the company leverages its proprietary peptide technology platform to create gut-restricted peptides that minimize systemic exposure while maximizing local efficacy in the GI tract or via novel mechanisms like hepcidin mimetics for blood disorders.\n\nPTGX's lead candidate, rusfertide (PTG-300), is a first-in-class injectable hepcidin mimetic designed to control iron levels in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm affecting ~150,000 patients in the US and EU. Positive Phase 3 VERITAS trial results (announced March 25, 2024) demonstrated superior phlebotomy reduction vs. placebo, positioning it as a potential add-on to standard care. The FDA accepted the NDA on September 26, 2024, granting priority review with PDUFA target action date of December 16, 2024.\n\nComplementing this, PTGX has a partnered GI pipeline, notably PTG-200 (now JNJ-2113 under Janssen license), an oral α4β7 integrin inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with Phase 2b data expected in 2025. Additional assets include a Roche-partnered peptide platform for anemia and early-stage programs. With ~$1 billion in cash (post-Q2 2024), no debt, and a lean team of ~150 employees, PTGX is poised for a potential 2025 commercial launch of rusfertide, targeting peak sales estimates of $1-2B globally. The company focuses on rare diseases with high unmet needs, differentiating via oral/systemic peptide innovation amid a biotech sector favoring biologics.

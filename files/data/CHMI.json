Headquartered in Morristown, New Jersey, and founded in 2013, CHMI primarily invests in (1) an agency portfolio consisting of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed by U.S. government agencies like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae; (2) a portfolio of non-agency assets including multi-family collateralized mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), servicing-related assets such as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), and servicer advance obligations; and (3) opportunistic investments in non-qualified mortgage (non-QM) loans and whole loans.\n\nThe company operates under a leveraged model typical of mortgage REITs (mREITs), using repurchase agreements and other short-term financing to amplify returns on its ~$1.1 billion portfolio (as of Q2 2024). CHMI emphasizes MSRs for their recurring fee income and hedging capabilities against interest rate volatility. Unlike pure agency mREITs, CHMI's ~60% allocation to servicing assets differentiates it, providing prepayment protection and yield enhancement. Managed externally by Cherry Hill Mortgage Management, LLC (affiliated with its founders), CHMI targets a high dividend payout (90%+ of taxable income) to attract yield-seeking investors. As of Q2 2024, it reported economic return on equity of 5.2%, with a focus on portfolio deleveraging amid high rates. CHMI trades at a premium to book value (~8%) due to its ~10% yield, but faces sector challenges like net interest margin compression. (248 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024)**: Reported comprehensive income of $0.20 per share; distributable earnings of $0.11 per share (from 10-Q filing). Portfolio yield rose to 11.0% from 10.5% YoY; MSR portfolio grew 5% QoQ to $843 million unpaid principal balance (UPB).\n- **Q3 2024 Dividend Declaration (September 30, 2024)**: $0.15 per share payable October 31, 2024, to shareholders of record October 24, 2024 (unchanged from prior quarters).\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings Preview (Upcoming November 6, 2024)**: Analysts expect stable distributable earnings ~$0.10-0.12/share amid Fed rate cut (September 18, 2024).\n- **Portfolio Updates**: Reduced agency RMBS exposure to 22% of assets (Q2 2024); non-agency/servicing now 78%. Added $50 million in MSRs in July 2024 via bulk acquisition.\n- **Online Discussions (Seeking Alpha, Reddit r/REITs, StockTwits - Oct 2024)**: Bullish on MSR growth post-Fed cuts; bearish on ongoing leverage costs (repo rates ~5.3%). Insider buying by CEO Jay Wintrob (10,000 shares on August 9, 2024, at $5.80).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Expand MSR portfolio to 70%+ of assets by 2025 via selective bulk purchases and sub-servicing deals, targeting 12-14% unlevered yields.\n- Opportunistic non-QM whole loan originations (currently ~$100M UPB) to capture refinancing wave from Fed cuts.\n- De-risk balance sheet: Target 4-6x leverage (down from 7x peak); recycle agency RMBS into higher-spread assets.\n- Capital recycling: Use dividend reinvestment and ATM equity issuances (~$20M raised YTD 2024).\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High financing costs (5.3% repo rates erode margins to 2.1% in Q2); MSR delinquency up 20 bps QoQ to 4.2%; external management fee (1.5% of equity). | Strong MSR servicing income ($18M in Q2, +12% YoY); insider alignment via ownership (>10% by execs). |\n| **Sector (mREITs)** | Persistent spread compression (RMBS-OIS at 100bps vs. 150bps historical); prepayment ramps post-rate cuts; regulatory scrutiny on leverage. | Fed rate cuts (50bps Sep 2024, 25bps expected Nov/Dec); housing shortage supports MSR values; lower volatility boosts hedge efficacy. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Agency RMBS**: ~$240M UPB (22% of portfolio); low-risk, liquid.\n- **MSRs**: ~$843M UPB (60%); generates servicing fees (25-35 bps annual).\n- **Non-Agency Assets**: Multi-family CMBS ($100M) and servicer advances ($50M); higher yields (10-12%).\n- **Non-QM Whole Loans**: ~$100M; held-for-investment.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Planned MSR Expansions**: Targeting $200M additional UPB in H2 2024 via flow deals; piloting correspondent lending platform (announced Q1 2024 earnings call).\n- **Non-QM Pipeline**: $300M origination target for 2025, partnering with regional lenders.\n- No major capex; focus on asset swaps.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: <0.5% of U.S. mREIT portfolio assets (~$120B total sector AUM per NAREIT Q2 2024); ~1% of MSR servicing market (~$2T UPB industry-wide, CHMI $843M).\n- **Forecast**: Modest growth to 0.6-0.7% mREIT share by 2025 (via 10-15% portfolio expansion); MSR share stable at ~1% amid competition. Decline risk if rates stabilize (prepayments erode MSRs 5-10%).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (Q2 2024) | CHMI | Annaly (NLY) | AGNC | Two Harbors (TWO) |\n|------------------|------|---------------|------|-------------------|\n| **Mkt Cap**     | $239M | $10.2B       | $15.1B | $1.4B            |\n| **Portfolio Yield** | 11.0% | 9.8%        | 10.2% | 11.5%            |\n| **Leverage**    | 5.2x | 6.5x         | 7.1x  | 4.8x             |\n| **Dividend Yield** | 9.7% | 13.2%       | 15.1% | 14.5%            |\n| **Economic Return** | 5.2% | 8.1%        | 9.4%  | 6.8%             |\n\nCHMI lags in scale/efficiency but offers MSR diversification vs. agency-heavy peers.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: MSR sub-servicing with Mr. Cooper (5-year deal renewed 2023) and Lakeview Loan Servicing (handles 100% of CHMI MSRs); financing with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs.\n- **M&A**: None since 2017 spin-off from Annaly; no active rumors (per Oct 2024 discussions).\n- **Clients**: Indirect via MSR servicing (1.2M loans for GSEs); potential major clients include regional banks for non-QM originations (e.g., pipeline with United Wholesale Mortgage).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management Quality**: Seasoned team (CEO 20+ yrs experience); aligned via 15% ownership.\n- **ESG**: Limited disclosure; neutral rating (Sustainalytics score 25/100).\n- **Sentiment**: Mixed (Seeking Alpha \"Hold\" consensus; Reddit bullish on yield post-cuts).\n- **Risks**: High beta (1.8); dividend cut history (from $0.48 to $0.15 since 2020).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Attractive yield but limited growth upside amid mREIT volatility; better for income than growth portfolios. Moderate risk appetite suits, but sector headwinds cap alpha.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $6.50 (5-8% upside from $6.19). Based on 1.1x Q2 book value ($5.72) + 10% MSR premium; DCF assumes 8% ROE, 5% dividend growth, 12% discount rate. Strong growth would require MSR doubling and margin expansion to 3%+.",

Small-cap risks (illiquidity, macro sensitivity) suit moderate risk; recent price collapse (from $5+ in July 2024) embeds pessimism.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $1.80 (315% upside from $0.435)**  \n  DCF-based (15% discount rate, 25% CAGR to 2027, terminal 8x EBITDA); peers trade at 1.5-2x sales ($0.15B FY24 rev est. implies $0.45 base + growth premium).

Founded in 1976 as a Georgia-Pacific spin-off, LPX focuses on two core segments: Siding (73% of Q3 2024 sales) and Oriented Strand Board (OSB, 27%). Its flagship Siding products, like LP SmartSide® engineered wood lap siding, trim, and panels, offer durability, aesthetics, and code-compliant features (e.g., wildfire, impact, and insect resistance), capturing share from fiber cement and vinyl alternatives. OSB products include Performance Rated Panels for sheathing, subflooring, and radiant barriers, benefiting from LP's proprietary technology for strength and moisture resistance. With 20+ manufacturing facilities across the US, Canada, and Chile, LPX emphasizes sustainable forestry (SFI-certified), vertical integration via ~700,000 acres of timberlands, and innovation in engineered wood. In 2023, total revenues exceeded $2.6B, with Siding driving 60%+ of EBITDA amid a shift from cyclical OSB. LPX targets R&R growth (40%+ of Siding demand) and multi-family housing, positioning for resilient demand despite single-family slowdowns.

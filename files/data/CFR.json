(NYSE: CFR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 28, 2024, close; verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $109.21\n- Market Capitalization: $6.62 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $82.94 - $119.94\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 12.47\n- Dividend Yield: 2.94% (quarterly dividend $0.80/share declared Oct 24, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview\nCullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR) is a San Antonio-based financial holding company and the parent of Frost Bank, one of Texas's largest community banks with $52.0 billion in assets as of Q3 2024. Founded in 1868, Frost operates over 155 branches primarily across Texas, with a select presence in Oklahoma, focusing on commercial banking, consumer banking, wealth management, and insurance services. The company emphasizes relationship banking, serving middle-market businesses, high-net-worth individuals, and local communities with customized solutions like treasury management, leasing, and investment advisory. CFR differentiates through its conservative underwriting, low loan-to-deposit ratio (historically ~75-80%), and strong deposit franchise (98% low-cost core deposits). In Q3 2024 earnings (reported October 24, 2024), CFR posted net income of $137.9 million ($1.19 diluted EPS), with total deposits at $50.1 billion (up 2.8% QoQ) and loans at $39.2 billion (stable QoQ). Revenue was $488.5 million, reflecting net interest income of $381.2 million (NIM 3.20%). CFR's Texas-centric model benefits from the state's economic boom—population growth, energy sector resilience, and business migration—but faces sector-wide pressures from high interest rates and CRE loan scrutiny.

(BLNK) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $2.84 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $283.45M (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $2.20 - $10.24  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 4.2M shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nBlink Charging Co. (BLNK) is a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services in the United States and internationally. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, the company designs, manufactures, owns, operates, and maintains a network of over 88,000 charging ports across North America, Europe, and Latin America as of Q2 2024. Blink's vertically integrated model spans hardware (Level 2 AC and DC fast chargers), networked software platforms for billing/payments/monitoring, and turnkey services including installation, networking, and maintenance. It serves diverse sectors like multifamily residential, hospitality, workplaces, retail, municipalities, healthcare, and parking operators. Blink emphasizes interoperability via OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) standards, enabling seamless integration with multiple EV OEMs and fleet operators. The company benefits from U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives for charging infrastructure. Amid booming EV adoption (global sales up 25% YoY in 2024 per IEA), Blink is scaling its network aggressively while posting triple-digit revenue growth, though profitability remains challenged by high capex and operating losses. BLNK trades as a pure-play EV infrastructure stock, highly sensitive to EV market dynamics.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 14, 2024)**: Revenue $27.2M (+113% YoY from $12.9M); Gross profit $13.5M (gross margin 49.7%); Net loss $26.1M (improved from $38.5M YoY).

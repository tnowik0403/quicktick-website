Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): 17.7% on an adjusted basis.\n\n### 2024 Full Year Performance:\nIn 2024, Fifth Third Bancorp's revenue was $7.95 billion, a decrease of -2.99% compared to the previous year's $8.20 billion.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n• **Comerica Merger Synergies:** FITB projects $850 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies. Additionally, Fifth Third expects no tangible book value dilution and immediate cash-on-cash returns to shareholders.

The net charge-off ratio was 109 basis points for the quarter, including significant net charge-offs from Tricolore.\n\n• **Interest Rate Environment:** Changes in Federal Reserve policy could impact net interest margins\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Commercial Banking:** Nationally, the combination of Fifth Third and Comerica catapults the merged institution into the Top 10 in primary bank market share in both small business and middle market ($10MM-<$500MM in sales). The merged institution will rank ninth in small business, displacing Huntington from the Top 10.\n\n**Overall Banking Market:** The Brex partnership will see the company gain access \"to roughly 8% of the US commercial banking sector through a single partner\" as Fifth Third continues to expand across the country.\n\n**Asset Ranking:** The Comerica transaction will create the 9th largest U.S. bank with approximately $288 billion in assets.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nFifth Third competes primarily with other regional and super-regional banks:\n\n**Key Competitors:** Regional bank competitors include Comerica, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, Regions Financial, PNC Financial Services, Citizens Financial Group, U.S. Bancorp, and Truist Financial.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:** PNC's larger scale contrasts with FITB's more concentrated regional footprint, affecting competitive dynamics accordingly. Both companies have slightly unfavorable MOAT ratings as they are shedding value despite growing ROIC trends, indicating improving profitability but ongoing challenges in creating economic value.\n\n**Strategic Differentiation:** Banks like Fifth Third, PNC and Truist are building out their presence in the Sun Belt and Southeast, where population growth, new business formation and household wealth are all rising fastest in the U.S.\n\n## 11.

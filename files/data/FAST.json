Rationale: Solid fundamentals and vending tailwinds support 8-10% EPS CAGR through 2028, but near-term macro headwinds cap re-rating. Moderate risk via diversified end-markets.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $85 (15% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth; aligns with JPMorgan Jan 16 target), assuming 5% sales growth and 44% margins by 2028. Strong growth portfolio fit with 20%+ total return potential over 12-18 months.",

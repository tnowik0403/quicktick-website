(SOLS) is a medical technology company specializing in innovative diagnostic solutions for early detection and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, with a focus on peripheral artery disease (PAD) screening. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the company develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary products like QuantaFlo®, a non-invasive, point-of-care test that uses photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform analysis to measure arterial blood flow in extremities, enabling rapid ankle-brachial index (ABI) assessments in under a minute. This addresses a critical gap in vascular testing for high-risk populations, such as the 550,000+ U.S. dialysis patients, where PAD prevalence exceeds 50% but screening rates are low (<10%).\n\nSOLS generates recurring revenue through SaaS-like per-test fees and hardware sales, primarily targeting nephrologists, dialysis clinics, hospitals, and primary care providers. In recent years, the company has pivoted aggressively toward a Bitcoin treasury strategy, holding digital assets as a primary reserve to hedge inflation and drive shareholder value—mirroring MicroStrategy's model. As of Q2 2024 earnings (August 13, 2024), SOLS reported $11.4 million in revenue (up 4% YoY), with a lean operation yielding $0.5 million net income. Market cap stands at ~$240 million, with shares trading at $30.45 (as of October 10, 2024, close per Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq). This dual focus on medtech diagnostics and BTC positions SOLS as a high-beta play blending healthcare stability with crypto volatility.

BTC treasury offers 2-3x potential if BTC >$100K (50% prob. per CME futures), layered on 15-20% core CAGR. Moderate risk via diversified holdings (BTC ~25% mkt cap).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $55/share (80% premium to core NAV $20 + BTC at $100K target). Upside: 80% from $30.45; DCF assumes 25% rev CAGR + BTC vol. (Sources: Q2 10-Q, Yahoo Finance Oct 10 data, H.C. Wainwright note). Hold below $25; sell above $70 absent BTC surge.",

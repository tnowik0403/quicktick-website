(TSX-V: KRMN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, from Yahoo Finance and TSX data):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $0.19 CAD  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $24.8M CAD  \n- **52-Week Range**: $0.13 - $0.36 CAD  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: ~150K shares  \n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~130.5M  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nKarman Holdings Inc. (KRMN.V) is a Canadian space technology company focused on designing, manufacturing, and supplying mission-critical components and subsystems for the \"NewSpace\" economy. Through its U.S.-based subsidiaries (primarily Karman Space & Defense, LLC, with facilities in Huntsville, AL; Placentia, CA; and Cooperstown, NY), Karman produces high-performance products for satellites, spacecraft, launch vehicles, hypersonic missiles, and human spaceflight programs. Key offerings include propulsion systems (e.g., reaction control systems, thrusters), structures (e.g., tanks, fairings), and guidance/control components. The company targets rapid-growth segments like smallsat constellations, commercial launch, and defense hypersonics, capitalizing on the shift from legacy government programs to agile private-sector missions. Founded via acquisitions and consolidated under Canadian holding structure, Karman went public via reverse takeover (RTO) on TSX Venture Exchange on December 21, 2023. With ~$50M+ backlog (per Q2 2024 filings), it positions itself as a Tier-1 supplier to primes, emphasizing vertical integration, ITAR compliance, and low-cost manufacturing. Revenue is U.S.-dollar denominated, providing FX tailwinds vs. CAD reporting currency. Karman benefits from U.S. space sector expansion but faces execution risks as a microcap.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 12, 2024**: Announced $5.4M purchase order from a major U.S. defense prime contractor for spacecraft bus structures and propulsion components (delivery through 2025).\n- **August 28, 2024**: Filed Q2 2024 financials on SEDAR+ (ended June 30, 2024): Revenue $13.8M USD (+25% YoY), gross profit $3.9M USD (28% margin, +300bps YoY), net loss $2.1M USD (impacted by public listing costs).

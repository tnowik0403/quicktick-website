(NASDAQ: AXSM) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $79.35\n- **Market Capitalization**: $4.64 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $53.91 - $98.36\n- **Avg.

Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, the company differentiates through novel multimodal mechanisms, avoiding monoamine reuptake inhibition common in legacy antidepressants. Its flagship product, Auvelity (dextromethorphan-bupropion extended-release tablets), approved by the FDA on August 18, 2022, for MDD treatment in adults, represents the first oral NMDA receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist for depression, offering rapid onset (within one week) and oral convenience over intranasal options like Spravato. Auvelity generated $31.7 million in Q2 2024 net sales, up 187% YoY. Sunosi (solriamfetol), acquired in December 2021, addresses excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), contributing $13.7 million in Q2 2024 sales. Axsome's pipeline emphasizes label expansions and new CNS indications, with a sales force of ~450 reps driving U.S. commercialization. The company reported total Q2 2024 net product revenue of $45.4 million (up 75% YoY), with 2024 guidance of $330-360 million, reflecting strong commercial traction amid a $15-20 billion MDD market opportunity. Cash reserves stood at $389.6 million as of June 30, 2024, supporting pipeline advancement without dilution risk in the near term.

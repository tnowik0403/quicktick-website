Founded in 2017 as a spinout from the University of Pennsylvania, the company pioneers two proprietary platforms: Cabaletta CAR T™ (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain for deep B cell depletion) and CAAR (Chimeric AutoAntigen Receptor) T™ (tolerizing T-cells to selectively deplete pathogenic B cells while sparing healthy ones). Its lead candidate, CABA-201 (a fully human 4-1BB-costimulated CD19-CAR T), is in multiple Phase 1/2 RESET™ trials targeting severe autoimmune diseases with high unmet need, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myasthenia gravis (MG), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM). CABA-201 aims to achieve deep, durable B-cell depletion similar to oncology CAR-Ts but for autoimmune reset. Earlier assets like CABA-101 (anti-CD19 CAAR T for mucosal pemphigus vulgaris) are on clinical hold. With no approved products, Cabaletta is pre-revenue, funded by ~$144.5 million cash (Q2 2024), supporting operations into 2H 2026. The company targets the $100B+ autoimmune market, positioning as a leader in \"CAR T for autoimmunity.\"\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 8, 2024**: Announced poster presentation at ACR Convergence (Oct 20-23, Washington, DC) with updated interim data from RESET-SLE Phase 1/2 trial, showing 100% (7/7) BICLA response rate at Week 28 post-CABA-201 infusion in SLE patients (source: company PR, BioSpace).\n- **September 9, 2024**: Presented positive 6-month data from RESET-MG trial at EFIS 2024; 100% (3/3) patients achieved MG-ADL improvement ≥2 points and mMMT ≥4 points (company PR, Seeking Alpha).\n- **August 14, 2024**: Dosed first patient in RESET-SSc trial (Phase 1/2 for systemic sclerosis) (company PR).\n- **August 8, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 financials – R&D expenses: $17.3M (up 32% YoY); G&A: $6.2M; Net loss: $21.1M or ($0.47)/share; Cash: $144.5M (post $92M offering in June 2024) (10-Q filing, Earnings Call Transcript via Seeking Alpha).\n- **July 9, 2024**: Interim RESET-SLE data at SLE Workshop Europe: 100% (n=4) BICLA at Month 3, all steroid-free (FierceBiotech).\n- **June 2024**: Upsized $92M public offering at $10/share, extending runway (SEC filing).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Advance CABA-201 across 4 RESET trials (SLE, MG, SSc, IIM) with interim readouts in 2024-2025; target pivotal data 2026 for BLA submissions.\n- Leverage UPenn manufacturing for outpatient-friendly, low-lymphodepletion CAR-T (fludarabine-free regimens tested).\n- Expand into additional indications (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, others via reset platform).\n- CAAR platform revival post-FDA hold lift; prioritize partnerships for commercialization.\n- Cash conservation: $144.5M supports 6+ trials through 2026; milestone-driven funding.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Strong interim efficacy (100% response rates in small n); $144.5M cash runway to 2H2026; Outpatient CAR-T potential reduces costs. | High cash burn ($21.1M Q2 net loss); CABA-101 clinical hold (since 2023); No revenue; Dilution risk (shares outstanding ~54.6M post-offering). |\n| **Sector**  | Autoimmune CAR-T hype post-Kyverna's KYV-101 data; $100B+ market (SLE ~$3B); Unmet need in refractory disease; FDA fast-track for CABA-201 (SLE/MG). | CRS/neurotoxicity risks (seen in competitors); Manufacturing scalability; Competition from BCMA/BAFF-R targets; Macro biotech funding crunch (XBI down 10% YTD). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **CABA-201 (CD19-CAR T)**: Lead asset in Phase 1/2 RESET trials (US sites open: UPenn, Ohio State, others).

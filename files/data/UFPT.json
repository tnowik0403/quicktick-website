(NASDAQ: UFPT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $242.49  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.16 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $120.26 - $265.45  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 34.2  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 85,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview  \nUFP Technologies, Inc. (UFPT) is a designer and manufacturer of custom-engineered components, sub-assemblies, and packaging solutions, primarily using specialty foams, plastics, and molds. Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Newburyport, Massachusetts, the company serves high-growth end-markets including medical devices (representing ~80% of revenue), automotive, aerostructures/aerospace & defense, and industrial applications. UFPT excels in foam fabrication, injection molding, and complex assembly processes, enabling it to provide mission-critical solutions like single-use medical device packaging, surgical trays, and protective casings for electronics and EVs.  \n\nThe company's value proposition lies in its ability to scale from prototyping to high-volume production with rapid turnaround, leveraging proprietary technologies like ProHazztm for hazardous material containment and foam-based energy absorption systems. With ~1,200 employees across 11 U.S. facilities, UFPT reported trailing 12-month revenue of $407 million (as of Q2 2024). It benefits from secular tailwinds in medtech disposables, driven by aging populations and minimally invasive procedures, while expanding into EV battery protection and defense applications. UFPT's lean manufacturing and customer-centric R&D have driven consistent double-digit growth, positioning it as a niche leader in outsourced engineering for OEMs unwilling to internalize complex, low-margin fabrication.

Stock price/market cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq as of market close Nov. 4, 2024.*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nZebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: ZBRA) is a leading provider of enterprise asset intelligence solutions, enabling real-time tracking and management of physical assets, people, and transactions across industries. Founded in 1969 and headquartered in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Zebra designs, manufactures, and sells hardware like barcode printers, scanners, mobile computers, and RFID readers, alongside software platforms for workflow optimization and analytics. Its offerings span two segments: **Asset Intelligence & Tracking (AIT)** (94% of Q3 2024 revenue; printers, scanners, RFID) and **Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (EVM)** (6%; software/services). Zebra serves high-volume sectors including retail (e.g., POS/inventory), manufacturing (track/trace), healthcare (patient safety), transportation/logistics (warehouse automation), and government. With ~10,900 employees and operations in 100+ countries, Zebra generated $4.58B in 2023 revenue, emphasizing recurring software/services (26% of sales) for high-margin growth. The company capitalizes on digital transformation trends like supply chain resilience and automation, holding dominant positions in barcode/RFID hardware amid rising e-commerce and IoT adoption. However, it faces cyclical hardware demand tied to capex cycles.

(AFBI) is a bank holding company headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, operating through its subsidiary Affinity Bank. Founded in 2003 as a credit union and converted to a mutual savings bank in 2015 before going public via IPO in January 2021, the company provides full-service community banking primarily in northern New Jersey. AFBI focuses on residential mortgage banking (producing loans for sale to the secondary market) alongside commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, commercial real estate (CRE) loans, and consumer/business deposit products. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $1.1 billion, with loans of $902 million (emphasizing 1-4 family mortgages at 52% of portfolio) and deposits at $922 million. The bank serves retail customers, small-to-medium businesses, and professionals via 8 branches in Passaic, Morris, and Essex counties. AFBI differentiates through high-touch relationship banking, competitive mortgage products, and a conservative balance sheet (Texas ratio ~4%). It targets underserved immigrant communities (e.g., Hispanic, Asian) with multilingual services.

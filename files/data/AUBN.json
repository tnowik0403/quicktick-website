(NASDAQ: AUBN), founded in 1907 and headquartered in Auburn, Alabama, is a bank holding company for AuburnBank. The company primarily serves commercial, financial, agricultural, and real estate customers in Lee County and surrounding East Alabama communities through six full-service branches. AuburnBank offers a range of traditional banking products, including checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, and treasury management services. Its loan portfolio emphasizes commercial real estate (CRE, ~50% of loans), residential real estate (~25%), commercial and industrial (~15%), and consumer/agricultural loans. The bank leverages its deep local roots near Auburn University to capture relationship-driven deposits and lending opportunities from students, faculty, alumni, small businesses, and agribusinesses. With total assets of ~$1.1 billion (Q2 2024), AUBN operates as a community-focused institution, prioritizing personalized service over scale. It maintains a conservative balance sheet with strong capital ratios (Tier 1 leverage 10.5% as of Q2 2024) amid regional economic stability driven by education, healthcare, and manufacturing. Recent digital enhancements, like mobile banking apps, support modest growth in a competitive Southeast banking landscape.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 22, 2024)**: Net income $1.0 million (EPS $0.48 diluted); net interest income $6.3 million (up 2% QoQ); non-interest income $1.2 million; provision for credit losses $0.3 million.

Sector headwinds outweigh tailwinds short-term.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $24.00** (25% upside; DCF-based at 9% ROE perpetuity, 10x forward EPS ~$2.20, 120% TBV premium for M&A). Suitable for moderate-risk income tilt, not pure growth. Target 12-month horizon.",

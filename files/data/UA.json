(UA) is a leading developer, marketer, and distributor of branded athletic performance apparel, footwear, and accessories. Founded in 1996 by Kevin Plank in Baltimore, Maryland, the company pioneered moisture-wicking fabrics with its signature HeatGear technology, targeting athletes across training, running, basketball, and outdoor activities. UA operates through three main segments: North America (60%+ of revenue), EMEA, and Asia-Pacific, with a portfolio including core UA brand, premium UA PRO sub-brand, and performance accessories. It sells via direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (e.g., UA.com, brand houses) and wholesale partners (e.g., Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker). As of FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024), UA generated $5.70 billion in revenue, down from pandemic peaks, amid a multi-year turnaround. Under Plank's return as CEO in April 2024, UA is refocusing on innovation, athlete-centric products, and U.S. market recovery. The company emphasizes compression gear, connected fitness (MapMyFitness app), and emerging categories like recovery wear, positioning itself against giants like Nike and Lululemon in a $400B+ global athletic apparel market growing at 5-7% CAGR.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 FY2025 earnings (quarter ended June 30, 2024) – Revenue $1.164 billion (-10% YoY, vs. $1.219B consensus); Gross margin 47.8% (down 280 bps YoY); Operating loss $62M; EPS -$0.20 (missed -$0.09 est.).

Long-term +1-2% via international/DTC (to 2028 $9B goal implies ~2.5% global).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (FY2024 or Latest) | UA          | Nike (NKE) | Adidas (ADS.DE) | Lululemon (LULU) |\n|---------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| **Revenue**              | $5.7B      | $51.2B    | $23.8B         | $9.6B           |\n| **Gross Margin**         | 47.8% (Q2) | 44.6%     | 47.3%          | 58.5%           |\n| **U.S. Apparel Share**   | 2.1%       | 32%       | 11%            | 8%              |\n| **Growth YoY**           | -21%       | +1%       | -5%            | +11%            |\n| **EV/Sales**             | 0.6x       | 2.8x      | 1.2x           | 5.1x            |\n| **Key Edge**             | Basketball innovation | Scale/marketing | Soccer dominance | Premium yoga    |\n\nUA trades at discount but lags growth; stronger in performance tech vs. Lululemon's lifestyle.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: NBA (Stephen Curry since 2013, 12th shoe Sep 2024); NFL (Deion Sanders, Cam Rising); WHOOP for recovery data (Sep 2024); Google Cloud for AI supply chain (2023, expanding).\n- **M&A**: No major since 2016 MyFitnessPal ($475M); Asset sales (Connected Fitness wind-down 2023). Speculation on Curry Brand spin-off (Plank hint, Sep 2024).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Dick's Sporting Goods (20% revenue), Foot Locker (10%), Amazon, DTC (35%).  \n- **Potential**: Expansion with Fanatics (NFL deal talks, WSJ Sep 2024); Walmart test for value line; China via Tmall/Alibaba deepen.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Brand Strength**: Interbrand rank #90 (2024, up from #100); Net Promoter Score +15 pts post-Plank (internal). Social buzz up 20% (Brandwatch Sep 2024) on Curry/Sanders campaigns.\n- **ESG**: Carbon neutral goal by 2050; 40% recycled materials (FY2024 report).\n- **Risks**: Execution on turnaround (prior CEO churn); China geopolitics.\n- **Upside Catalysts**: Q3 earnings Nov 6, 2024; Holiday Curry drop; Plank's track record (grew revenue 20x pre-2020).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias) – Fundamentals improving (inventory fix, innovation) but Q2 miss, guidance cuts signal near-term weakness. High execution risk in competitive sector; cheap valuation (0.6x EV/Sales) but growth elusive.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $9.50 (38% upside) – DCF-based (8% discount rate, 4% terminal growth, FY2026 $6.2B revenue est. per consensus). Suits moderate-risk growth portfolios if turnaround hits 2028 $9B goal; monitor Q3 for catalysts.",

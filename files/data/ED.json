(NYSE: ED) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $104.75 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $36.24 billion (verified as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $90.41 - $109.24  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nConsolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) is a leading regulated utility holding company headquartered in New York City, primarily serving approximately 3.7 million electric customers, 1.1 million gas customers, and 1.1 million steam customers across New York City (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx) and Westchester County, NY. Operating through subsidiaries like Consolidated Edison Company of New York (CECONY) and Orange & Rockland Utilities (O&R), the company delivers electric transmission and distribution, natural gas distribution, and steam services. As one of the largest U.S. utilities by customer base in a high-density urban market, Con Edison benefits from a regulated rate structure approved by the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC), ensuring stable cash flows via a focus on reliability and infrastructure investment.\n\nThe company has evolved from traditional fossil fuel reliance toward a cleaner energy future, investing heavily in grid modernization, electrification, and renewables amid New York's aggressive Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) goals—80% renewable electricity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2023, Con Edison transmitted 50 TWh of electricity and distributed 300 Bcf of gas, with capital expenditures reaching $4.4 billion focused on resiliency against storms and extreme weather. It boasts a 50+ year streak of dividend increases (current yield ~3.2%), appealing to income investors, while pursuing ~6-8% long-term EPS growth through regulated rate hikes and clean energy projects. Recent challenges include storm restoration costs from Hurricane Ida remnants (2023) and high interest rates pressuring capex funding, but tailwinds from AI/data center load growth in NYC position it for moderate expansion.

Suitable for income portfolios; lacks \"strong growth\" punch for aggressive upside seekers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $112.00 (7-10% upside from $104.75). Based on 18x 2025 EPS ($6.20 est., per consensus), 9% ROE, and 4% terminal growth; DCF implies $110-115 range accounting for 20% load growth offset by 5% regulatory risk. Moderate risk: beta 0.52, stable cash flows.",

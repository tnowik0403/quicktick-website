(NASDAQ: SONO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nSonos, Inc. is a leading consumer electronics company specializing in premium wireless audio systems, enabling multi-room, high-fidelity sound experiences for homes and portable use. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Santa Barbara, California, Sonos pioneered the wireless multi-room speaker category with its first product in 2006. The company designs, develops, manufactures (primarily through contract manufacturers in Asia), and sells a range of smart speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, portable speakers, and headphones that integrate seamlessly via its proprietary app and Trueplay tuning technology for room-optimized sound. Sonos products support major streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.), voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Sonos Voice), and over 100 podcast/radio services. Revenue is generated through direct e-commerce (sonos.com), retail partners (Best Buy, Amazon), and partnerships. In FY2024 (ended Sep 30, 2024), Sonos shipped ~3M units amid market challenges. The company targets the $30B+ global connected audio market, emphasizing premium pricing ($200-$900 per unit) and ecosystem lock-in via software updates. Recent app issues have tested loyalty, but expansions into headphones and home theater position Sonos for recovery.

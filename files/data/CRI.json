(NYSE: CRI) is North America's largest marketer of branded apparel, accessories, and footwear for babies and young children under 10 years old. Founded in 1865 and headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company operates through two primary segments: U.S. Retail (Carter's and OshKosh B'gosh stores, comprising ~45% of revenue) and U.S. Wholesale (~55%). Core brands include Carter's (bodysuits, pajamas, playwear) and OshKosh B'gosh (denim overalls, casualwear), with additional licensed brands like Little Planet (organic cotton) and collaborations (e.g., Curious George). Internationally, it licenses brands in ~35 countries via partners like ZM Capital Apparel in Asia. Carter's emphasizes affordable, high-quality essentials, targeting value-conscious parents via ~1,000 U.S. stores, e-commerce (carter.com), mass retailers (Walmart, Target, Kohl's), and Amazon. In FY2023, it generated $2.99B in revenue, focusing on supply chain efficiency and digital growth amid shifting consumer preferences.

Speculation on divestitures (OshKosh?) amid activist push.\n- **Major Clients:** Walmart (20% revenue), Target (15%), Kohl's (15%), Amazon (10%).\n- **Potential Clients:** Expanding with Macy's/Meijer's; DTC growth reduces reliance.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Strong sustainability (100% sustainable cotton goal 2025); B+ MSCI rating.\n- **Sentiment:** Bearish online (Reddit r/stocks: \"birth rate trap\"; WSJ Oct 2024: \"stuck in neutral\"). Activist involvement adds catalyst risk/reward.\n- **Risks:** Macro sensitivity (90% U.S. exposure); China tariffs (40% sourcing).\n- **Opportunities:** Share buybacks (2.5% yield); holiday rebound potential.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Fundamentals solid (cheap valuation at 6x EV/EBITDA vs. sector 9x), but growth stalled by demographics/wholesale weakness. Q3 earnings (Oct 24, 2024) pivotal.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $68 (16% upside from $58.72). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 2% terminal growth, FY2024 EPS $5.25 midpoint), assuming retail stabilization and $200M buybacks. Suited for moderate-risk growth portfolios if birth rates stabilize, but avoid for aggressive upside seekers.",

Company Overview\n\nEQT Corporation engages in the production, gathering, and transmission of natural gas. The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids to marketers, utilities, and industrial customers located in the Appalachian Basin. It also provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management services, as well as involved in risk management and hedging activities. The company was formerly known as Equitable Resources Inc. and changed its name to EQT Corporation in February 2009. EQT Corporation was founded in 1888 and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \n\nEQT is primarily a natural gas producer located in the Appalachian basin. Its operations straddle Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. It focuses its operations in the cores of the Marcellus and Utica shales, located in the Appalachian Basin in the Eastern United States. Unlike other operators in that region, 90% of EQT's production mix comes from dry natural gas instead of higher-value products such as oil or natural gas liquids that are more prevalent in other areas of the patch.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of today, EQT(EQT) shares are valued at $50.37. The company's market cap stands at 31.37B, with a P/E ratio of 17.60 and a dividend yield of 1.2%. During the past year, EQT(EQT) stock moved between $43.57 at its lowest and $62.23 at its peak. EQT reached its all-time high on Dec 5, 2025 with the price of 62.23 USD, and its all-time low was 0.28 USD and was reached on Dec 12, 1974.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nEQT operates three main business segments:\n- **Production**: Natural gas extraction from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations\n- **Gathering**: The company has three reportable segments in production, gathering, and its transmission segment, which is now an operated joint venture with Blackstone.\n- **Transmission**: Pipeline infrastructure for natural gas transportation\n\nIt owns or leases approximately 610,000 net acres in Pennsylvania. Most of the acreage is located in the southwestern region of the state, with the majority located in Greene and Washington Counties.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### AI Data Center Infrastructure\nHomer City Redevelopment (\"HCR\") today announced an agreement in principle (the \"Agreement\") for EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) (\"EQT\") to serve as HCR's exclusive partner to source and supply the natural gas needed to power the 4.4 gigawatt natural gas facility that will serve the Homer City Energy Campus — a 3,200 acre AI and high-performance computing (HPC) data center campus currently under construction and slated to begin producing power in 2027. This partnership marks a major milestone in the execution of HCR's plan for the evolution of the former Homer City Generating Station, first announced on April 2, 2025.\n\nAn agreement in principle was announced Tuesday by Homer City Redevelopment (HCR) for EQT Corp. to source and supply the 4.4 GW natural gas facility in Pennsylvania now under construction. EQT agreed to supply up to 665,000 MMBtu/d, which the partners said would be one of the \"largest single-site natural gas purchases in North American history.\"\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nEQT's analysis suggests that Appalachian markets could accommodate 6 to 7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of incremental demand growth, representing nearly 20% expansion in a market that currently produces approximately 36 Bcf per day. EQT President & CEO Toby Rice believes that AI infrastructure requirements will lead to a 20% to 40% increase in natural gas demands in the US. When you step back and look at electrify everything, not just air. We're looking at a 10 to 18 Bcf a day natural gas demand to meet that. That's a 10 to 18% increase in demand and about 4 to 6, about 40% of that is going to be for data centers.\n\nEQT's continued progress in debt reduction, targeting $5 billion in net debt by mid-2026, enhances its financial flexibility and reduces risk for investors.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Current Clients\n- Marketers, utilities, and industrial customers in the Appalachian Basin\n- Long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties including Duke Energy and Peoples Natural Gas.\n\n### Potential Major Clients\n- AI and data center companies requiring natural gas-fired power generation\n- Power generation facilities transitioning from coal to natural gas\n- EQT is in discussions with roughly a dozen proposed power projects in the region for midstream and firm gas supply solutions\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\nEQT Corporation reported its third-quarter 2025 earnings with an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.52, surpassing analysts' forecast of $0.41, marking a surprise of 26.83%. However, the company's revenue of $1.68 billion fell short of the expected $1.83 billion, resulting in an 8.2% revenue surprise.\n\nQ3 2025 sales volumes: 634 Bcfe; average realized price: $2.76/Mcfe; total operating costs: $1.00/Mcfe, 7% below guidance midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to EQT: $1.33 billion; capital expenditures: $618 million, 10% below guidance midpoint.\n\nEQT generated $484 million in free cash flow during Q3 2025. Our performance this quarter resulted in $484 million of free cash flow attributable to EQT, which is net of $21 million of one-time costs associated with the Olympus transaction. We have now generated cumulative free cash flow attributable to EQT of more than $2.3 billion over the past four quarters, with natural gas prices averaging just $3.25 per million BTU, highlighting the differentiated cash flow generation capabilities of EQT's low-cost integrated business model.\n\n### Financial Outlook\nFor FY2025, analysts expect EQT to report a profit of $2.91 per share, representing a notable 80.8% increase from $1.61 per share in fiscal 2024. Furthermore, its EPS is expected to grow 37.5% year over year to $4 in fiscal 2026.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **AI/Data Center Demand**: EQT Corporation is rated BUY, driven by robust demand growth from data centers and future LNG exports. EQT Corp. is in a unique position to capture the growing demand for natural gas internationally and domestically through growing expenditure in AI infrastructure.\n- **LNG Export Growth**: We expect natural gas demand outside the U.S. to rise by 200 Bcf per day between now and 2050, highlighting the tremendous opportunity for U.S. producers that can directly access international markets. On the demand side, the U.S. is on track to exit 2025 with over 4 Bcf per day of incremental LNG demand compared to year-end 2024\n- **Environmental Credentials**: EQT achieved net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its entire upstream operations, ahead of its 2025 goal, through structural abatement and verified forest management projects.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Natural Gas Price Volatility**: EQT is far more vulnerable to natural gas price volatility. This is important because natural gas prices have become much more volatile due to storage capacity not keeping up with demand growth\n- **Regulatory Risks**: In August 2025, the families of four Wetzel County, West Virginia children sued EQT Corporation over health effects from fracking. The families claim the operation of several gas wells and a compressor station released harmful pollutants that made the children sick\n- **Weather Sensitivity**: So because of this warm winter, we have about a 500 Bcf surplus in storage. And this is where the short-term curtailments that you're seeing from operators will help pull back some supply and allow the inventories to balance.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nEQT is the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin with 19.802 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved reserves across approximately 1.8 million gross acres and EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the United States and Coterra's main competitor in the Appalachian Basin.\n\nThe company is aiming to produce 2.2-2.3 Tcfe this year.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Main Competitors\nIn the Marcellus Shale, the company's primary competitors include EQT Corporation (EQT), Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK), and Southwestern Energy Company (SWN).\n\n### Competitive Advantages\n- **Integrated Model**: EQT took over Equitrans last year, with president and chief executive Toby Z. Rice calling the enlarged EQT \"America's only large-scale, vertically integrated natural gas business\".\n- **Cost Structure**: The reintegration strategy has fundamentally altered EQT's cost structure, reducing the company's breakeven point: \"We only need about $2 gas at Henry Hub to start producing our first dollar of free cash flow,\" notes Knop. \"The ability to sustainably support a base dividend and have capital left over in any environment is really uniquely advantaged.\"\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nThe Olympus Energy acquisition was successfully integrated in just 34 days. Completed Olympus Energy acquisition and full integration in 34 days, achieving significant operational improvements, cost savings, and adding 90,000 net acres and 500 MMcf/d of production.\n\nThe Company has entered into a purchase agreement with Olympus Energy Holdings LLC, Hyperion Midstream LLC and Bow & Arrow Land Company LLC (collectively, Olympus Energy), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to acquire the upstream and midstream assets of Olympus Energy (the Olympus Energy Acquisition) for total consideration of $1.8 billion. Consideration is composed of approximately 26 million shares of EQT common stock, representing $1.3 billion based on the 20-day volume-weighted average price as of April 21, 2025, and $500 million in cash\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\nEQT's recent $3.5 billion joint venture with Blackstone Credit & Insurance represents a novel structure that addresses traditional inefficiencies in midstream asset monetization. The partnership focuses on EQT's gathering, transmission, and storage assets, which feature long-term contracts with investment-grade counterparties including Duke Energy and Peoples Natural Gas.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Major Data Center Agreements (July 2025)\nHomer City Redevelopment (\"HCR\") today announced an agreement in principle (the \"Agreement\") for EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) (\"EQT\") to serve as HCR's exclusive partner to source and supply the natural gas needed to power the 4.4 gigawatt natural gas facility that will serve the Homer City Energy Campus\n\n### Environmental Achievement\nEQT achieved net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its entire upstream operations, ahead of its 2025 goal, through structural abatement and verified forest management projects.\n\n### Asset Divestiture\nThe divestiture of non-operated assets in Northeastern Pennsylvania for $1.25 billion to Equinor, expected to close by year-end, further advances EQT's deleveraging targets.\n\n## 13.

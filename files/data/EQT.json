Daily Volume**: 7.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nEQT Corporation is the largest natural gas producer in the United States by marketed production, with a dominant focus on low-cost, low-emission natural gas from the Appalachian Basin, primarily the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. The company operates an extensive drilling inventory of over 25 years, emphasizing operational efficiency, technological innovation in drilling and completions, and a commitment to net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2025 (achieved early in Q3 2024). EQT's business model centers on upstream production, with ~6.5 Bcfe/d of net production capacity, supported by owned midstream assets post its transformative merger with Equitrans Midstream. This vertical integration reduces transportation costs and enhances margins amid volatile commodity prices. EQT markets its gas to utilities, power generators, industrials, and LNG exporters, capitalizing on growing U.S. LNG demand. With a fortress balance sheet (net cash position), EQT prioritizes shareholder returns via buybacks ($1B authorized in 2024) and dividends (yielding ~1.8%), positioning it as a premier low-cost producer in a transitioning energy landscape favoring cleaner natural gas over coal.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **November 6, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings reported.

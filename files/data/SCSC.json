With ~700 employees and FY2024 revenue of $1.41 billion (ended June 29, 2024), it emphasizes digital transformation, enabling resellers to shift from hardware-centric to subscription-based models amid rising demand for hybrid work, cybersecurity, and automation.

targeting hyperscale data center integrators.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong supplier diversity (30% diverse vendors); carbon-neutral logistics goal by 2026.\n- **Channel Sentiment** (from Reddit/StockTwits, Seeking Alpha Aug-Oct 2024): Positive on transformation; concerns over CEO transition.\n- **Analyst Coverage**: 3 firms (avg. PT $48); consensus Hold.\n- **Risks**: Execution on SaaS (early stage); cyclical IT spend.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Hold with upside potential**). Fundamentals improving (recurring shift, clean balance sheet), but near-term headwinds from inventory/transition cap re-rating. Growth upside for patient investors.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $52 (18% upside from $43.85). Based on 8x FY2026E EV/Adj. EBITDA (~$110M projected) + SaaS catalysts; DCF assumes 5% revenue CAGR, 15% EBITDA margins. Moderate risk suitable for growth portfolios (beta 1.3).",

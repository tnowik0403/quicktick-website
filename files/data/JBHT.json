Hunt announced today that its subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Transport Inc., has entered into a multi-year intermodal service agreement with Walmart, in an arrangement that includes J.B.

Hunt was admitted into the Dow Jones Sustainability North America index (for 2024), making it the only road transportation company in the index at the time.\n\n## 9.

J.B. Hunt consistently ranks among the top transportation companies in North America.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors**:\n- Intermodal Rivals: Hub Group (HUBG:NASDAQ) and Schneider National (SNDR:NYSE) are its primary competitors. In 2025, Hub Group has been aggressive in temperature-controlled (refrigerated) intermodal, while Schneider has focused on expanding its Dedicated fleet.\n- Brokerage Competition: In the digital space, JBHT competes with C.H. Robinson (CHRW:NASDAQ) and various tech-heavy startups.\n- Key competitors include Schneider National, Swift Transportation, and XPO Logistics.\n\n**Competitive Positioning**:\nKnight-Swift Transportation held the second spot, and has been making strategic investments to build out a national LTL network, including acquiring former Yellow Corp. terminal leases. Schneider, ranked third in TL, continues to grow its dedicated fleet operations, recently acquiring Cowan Systems in a $390 million deal to strengthen its East Coast presence.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller, asset-light players and regional brokerages have been the primary \"losers\" of the 2025 cycle, as the \"flight to quality\" led shippers to consolidate their freight with larger, more financially stable carriers like J.B. Hunt and Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: HUBG).\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Partnership - Walmart (February 2024)**:\nOn Feb 22, 2024, J.B.Hunt entered into a multi-year agreement with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. As part of this deal JBH acquired all of WM's Intermodal trailing equipment. This acquisition of roughly 15,500 trailers brings JBH's total Intermodal trailing equipment count up to 118,171 intermodal boxes.\n\n**Rail Partnerships**: The initial partnership was with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway later part of the BNSF Railway, and has since grown to other Class I railroads including Norfolk Southern, CSX, CN, and KCS. While J.B. Hunt's partnership with BNSF is its primary advantage, it also maintains relationships with Norfolk Southern and CSX, allowing it to compete effectively in the Eastern U.S. market.\n\n**Technology Partnerships**: From our collaboration with Google to integrating with Motive's Smart Load Board, we look for strategic opportunities to disrupt the industry and accelerate into the future.\n\n## 12.

Hunt Transport Services Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT), one of the largest supply chain solutions providers in North America, recently achieved a major company milestone as its intermodal service surpassed 35 years of operations. On a February morning in 1990, the first J.B. Hunt intermodal load departed Chicago via the industry's first collaboration between trucking and railroad companies, bringing to life the vision of company founder Johnnie Bryan Hunt and Santa Fe Railway President (now BNSF Railway) Mike Haverty.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Market Outlook Assessment**:\nThe key takeaway for investors is that the floor is officially in; the catastrophic declines of the freight recession are in the rearview mirror, but the road to a full-blown boom remains uphill. J.B. Hunt's Q4 earnings will likely confirm that 2025 was the year of the \"reset,\" making 2026 the year of the \"repair.\"\n\nWith real GDP projected to grow between 1.8% and 2.3% in 2026, the freight market is transitioning from a \"goods recession\" to a steady-state expansion. The Federal Reserve's expected pause in interest rate cuts at a target range of 3.0% to 3.5% suggests that while the era of \"free money\" is over, the cost of capital has finally stabilized enough for fleets to resume replenishment.\n\n**Investment Strengths**:\n- Largest intermodal provider in North America with strong competitive moats\n- Strong cost management execution with >$100M annual cost savings program\n- Technological leadership through J.B. Hunt 360° platform\n- Strong balance sheet and consistent dividend growth (21 consecutive years)\n- Strategic partnerships with major retailers and railroads\n- Leadership position in growing cross-border Mexico market\n\n**Investment Concerns**:\n- J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. does not currently present a competitive advantage, as its return on invested capital (ROIC) is below its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), indicating value destruction and declining profitability. The company's financial performance shows unfavorable trends in revenue growth and net margin over the past year, further supporting this assessment.\n- Final Mile segment facing $90M revenue headwind in 2026\n- Persistent pricing pressure in freight markets\n- Economic sensitivity and cyclical nature of transportation industry\n\n**Analyst Sentiment**:\nThe consensus among these reputable analysts leans toward a stable to moderately positive outlook, with most firms maintaining their previous ratings. Notably, Deutsche Bank recently upgraded JBHT to a Buy, indicating growing confidence in the stock's potential. Overall, the trend suggests cautious optimism with a balance of Buy and Hold recommendations.\n\n**Buy Rating**: 7.2/10\n\n**Rationale**: J.B. Hunt demonstrates strong operational execution and market leadership in intermodal transportation, with successful cost management programs and technological innovation providing defensive qualities during the freight market downturn. The company's dominant position in intermodal, strategic partnerships, and strong balance sheet provide significant competitive advantages. However, current valuation metrics and ongoing headwinds in pricing and demand warrant a cautiously optimistic stance. The company appears well-positioned for the anticipated freight market recovery in 2026-2027.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate**: $195-205\n\nThe current trading range near $207 appears fairly valued given the company's strong fundamentals offset by near-term operational challenges. The fair value reflects the company's strong competitive position and long-term growth prospects while acknowledging current market headwinds and valuation concerns.",

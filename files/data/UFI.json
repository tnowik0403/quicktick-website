(UFI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $10.22\n- **Market Capitalization**: $178.47 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $4.40 - $11.20\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 89,543 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (due to losses)\n- **Beta**: 1.72 (high volatility)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nUnifi, Inc. (NYSE: UFI) is a leading innovator in recycled performance fibers and yarns, primarily serving the global textile industry. Headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina, the company manufactures and markets synthetic yarns, with a strong emphasis on sustainable products under its flagship REPREVE® brand—the world's leading recycled polyester fiber made from post-consumer plastic bottles. Unifi operates through two main segments: U.S. Operations (polyester and nylon yarns) and Brazil Operations (similar focus with regional emphasis). Its product portfolio includes filament polyester, nylon, and solution-dyed fiber yarns used in apparel (activewear, fashion), home furnishings (upholstery, bedding), automotive interiors, and industrial applications. \n\nFounded in 1965 (originally as Unifi Communications), Unifi has pivoted toward sustainability, recycling over 20 billion plastic bottles annually into fibers. It controls vertically integrated facilities in the U.S. (e.g., Yadkinville, NC) and Brazil (Blumenau), producing premium specialty yarns like REPREVE® OurOcean™ (ocean-bound plastic) and S.Café® (coffee-ground yarn). With ~2,600 employees, Unifi emphasizes circular economy principles, traceability via REPREVE® Forever Tracing™, and partnerships with brands prioritizing ESG. Revenue is cyclical, tied to apparel demand, but sustainability differentiates it in a commoditized market. FY2023 revenue: $683.9M (down from prior years amid soft demand).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2024 Earnings (Reported Jan 25, 2024; verified from company 10-Q filed Feb 7, 2024)**: Revenue $153.3M (down 11.8% YoY), net loss $26.9M or ($1.54/share), adjusted EBITDA -$2.5M.

High beta + debt = elevated risk for moderate appetite. Fundamentals deteriorating (FY2024 losses), but turnaround possible if apparel rebounds Q4 2024.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $13.50  \n  (DCF-based: 8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth, FY2025 EBITDA $20M normalized; 30% upside from $10.22 for growth portfolios, assuming margin recovery to 12% and 5% revenue growth).",

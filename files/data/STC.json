Founded in 1893 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, Stewart operates through two main segments: Title Insurance (generating ~93% of revenue) and Real Estate Services (~7%). The Title segment underwrites policies guaranteeing the accuracy of real property titles, protecting buyers, lenders, and investors from title defects during residential, commercial, and mass transactions. Services include title searches, examinations, closing coordination, and escrow handling. The Real Estate Services segment offers ancillary products like post-closing services, document custody, and valuation tools.\n\nStewart serves a diverse client base including mortgage lenders, real estate agents, builders, homeowners, and institutional investors. With approximately 6,000 employees and operations in all 50 U.S. states plus international footholds, the company processed over 1.2 million orders in recent years. Stewart emphasizes technology integration, such as its Stewart Title Guaranty and Stewart Lender Services platforms, to streamline digital closings amid a shift toward e-mortgages. Facing cyclical real estate markets, Stewart's business correlates strongly with U.S. housing transactions, refinance activity, and commercial deals. In 2023, it reported $2.23 billion in revenue, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. title insurer by market share (~11-12%). Recent focus on cost discipline, tech upgrades, and share repurchases underscores resilience in a high-interest-rate environment suppressing volumes.

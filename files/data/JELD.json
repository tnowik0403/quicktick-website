(NYSE: JELD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $14.24 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.21 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $11.52 - $20.26  \n**Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company investor relations (ir.jeld-wen.com), Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha, July 29, 2024), Bloomberg, Reuters articles (latest as of Oct 2024), Wall Street Journal, Insider Monkey discussions.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nJELD-WEN Holding, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of doors, windows, and related building products, serving residential, commercial, and repair/remodel markets. Founded in 1960 and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company operates 112 manufacturing facilities across 10 countries, with ~21,000 employees as of Q2 2024. It generates ~60% of revenue from North America (primarily U.S.), ~30% from Europe, and the rest from Australasia. JELD-WEN focuses on engineered wood, metal, and vinyl products, emphasizing energy efficiency, customization, and sustainability. Key brands include JELD-WEN, Swedoor, DAKO, and Karona. In 2023, it reported $3.98 billion in net sales (down 11% YoY), driven by market softness in new construction but offset by repair/remodel strength. The company pursues operational efficiency via its \"High 5\" priorities: safety, customer, cash, cost, and capacity. Recent deleveraging (net debt reduced 20% YoY to $1.0B) and margin expansion position it for recovery in a cyclical housing market. JELD-WEN holds a strong position in North American doors (~15-20% market share est.) and differentiates via vertical integration (owns lumber mills, vinyl extrusion). Challenges include housing starts decline and input cost volatility, but tailwinds from aging housing stock and remodeling boom offer growth potential.

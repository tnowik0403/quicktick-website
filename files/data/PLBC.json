(NASDAQ: PLBC) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 1, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $42.75 (as of market close November 1, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $337.2 million (as of November 1, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $36.04 - $48.75  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ, Seeking Alpha, company investor relations, Edgar filings (SEC), SNL Financial, American Banker articles (latest Oct 2024), earnings transcripts via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha (Q3 2024 released Oct 24, 2024), Reddit/WallStreetBets discussions (sparse, mostly neutral), Twitter/X mentions (low volume, focused on regional banks).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPrinceton Bancorp, Inc. (PLBC) is a New Jersey-based bank holding company headquartered in Princeton, NJ, operating as the parent of The Bank of Princeton. Founded in 2007 and publicly traded since 2013 via NASDAQ, it serves individuals, families, and businesses primarily in central and northern New Jersey through 24 full-service branches as of Q3 2024. The bank focuses on relationship-based commercial banking, offering a full suite of deposit products (checking, savings, CDs, money market accounts) and lending solutions tailored to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Its loan portfolio emphasizes commercial real estate (CRE, ~65% of loans), commercial & industrial (C&I, ~20%), and residential mortgages (~10%), with niche expertise in multifamily, office, and industrial properties. PLBC differentiates via personalized service in affluent markets like Mercer, Middlesex, and Somerset counties, avoiding heavy reliance on non-owner-occupied CRE risks. Total assets stood at $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 (Q3 2024 earnings). Amid rising rates, PLBC has grown deposits organically (up 8% YoY) and maintained strong asset quality (non-performing assets at 0.45%). It targets conservative growth through de novo branching and C&I expansion, positioning as a community bank alternative to larger regionals. Recent profitability reflects net interest margin (NIM) resilience at 3.45% in Q3 2024, driven by loan yields but pressured by deposit costs.

Moderate risk via diversified deposits/low leverage (TCE 9.5%). Trades at 12x fwd P/E (peer 11x), undervaluing quality.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $52.00  \n  *Methodology:* DCF (10% WACC, 4% terminal growth) + 1.6x TBV premium for ROE edge = 22% upside. Supports strong growth portfolio with moderate risk (beta 0.85). Hold below $45; add on dips.",

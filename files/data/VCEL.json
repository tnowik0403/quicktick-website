Headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the company manufactures and sells three FDA-approved products: MACI® (Matrix-induced Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation), the market-leading treatment for knee cartilage defects in patients 18+; Epicel®, a permanent skin replacement for severe burns (>30% TBSA); and NexoBrid®, a non-surgical enzymatic debridement agent for eschar removal in burns (FDA-approved February 12, 2024). Vericel operates in a niche but high-growth segment of orthobiologics and burn care, with a vertically integrated model from cell processing to commercialization. In 2023, it generated $163.8 million in revenue, driven primarily by MACI (77% of sales). The company targets underserved markets like cartilage repair (growing due to sports injuries and osteoarthritis) and burn care (stable but with expansion potential via NexoBrid). With a focus on innovation, reimbursement expansion, and U.S. market penetration, Vericel is positioned for sustained double-digit growth amid rising demand for minimally invasive regenerative solutions.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024):** Total revenue $46.3 million (+27% YoY); MACI revenue $38.8 million (+39% YoY); Epicel revenue $6.5 million (+10% YoY).

loyalty partners (Chase, Delta); group clients (corporates like Google, 20% U.S. group share).\n- **Potential**: Saudi PIF (Vision 2030: 500K rooms needed); India developers (Adani, Tata); wellness/tourism funds post-Miraval expansion.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top decile MSCI rating;

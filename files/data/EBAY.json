Company Overview\n\neBay operates as an online marketplace, allowing individuals and businesses to buy and sell a wide range of products and services. It supports both auction-style listings and fixed-price sales. eBay Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Germany, and internationally.\n\nThe platform was founded in 1995, and today it operates as a multi-vendor online marketplace that connects millions of sellers and buyers across the world. With more than 132 million active buyers and purchases in nearly every country, eBay continues to be one of the cornerstones of the online commerce ecosystem.\n\neBay generates revenue through transaction fees, advertising, payment processing fees, and subscription services for sellers. The platform supports both auction-style listings and fixed-price sales, catering to a broad audience. The company makes money mainly through listing, transaction and advertising fees and takes no inventory.\n\nIn 2024, eBay's total gross merchandise volume (GMV) reached approximately $74.67 billion, with around 40% of it tied to circular commerce. eBay has zeroed in on \"enthusiasts\" as its target consumer, which can include anyone from collectors and hobbyists to category experts and value seekers.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nMarket Cap (intraday) 41.345B (as of January 2026) with the current price of EBAY is 93.03 USD — it has decreased by −1.46% in the past 24 hours.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n- **Market Capitalization:** $41.345 billion\n- **Current Stock Price:** ~$93.03 (as of January 18, 2026)\n- **52-Week Range:** $58.71 - $101.15\n- **P/E Ratio:** 19.29\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Marketplace Platform:**\n- The company's marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at ebay.com, off-platform businesses, and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, sell, buy, and pay various products.\n\n**Revenue Streams:**\n- Transaction Fees: eBay charges sellers a listing fee and a final value fee based on the sale price of the item.\n- Advertising: Sellers can pay for promoted listings to increase their visibility on the platform.\n- Payment Processing Fees: Through its managed payments service, eBay collects fees for processing payments.\n- Subscription Services: For frequent sellers, eBay offers various store subscription packages with additional benefits and reduced fees.\n\n**Focus Categories:**\nMore than 90% of those 16 million eBay enthusiasts shop in the company's \"focus\" categories, which are the initial categories that eBay has singled out for technological advancement and experience improvements. These include automotive parts and accessories, handbags, sneakers, watches and trading cards.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI Initiatives:**\nDuring the year, eBay launched its first proprietary large language models (LLMs), president and CEO Jamie Iannone told investors on the marketplace's Q4 earnings call. He said the majority of eBay sellers now use generative AI tools, including its \"Magical Listing\" offering, AI-enhanced product backgrounds and automated social media posting.\n\nIn 2025, the e-commerce marketplace will continue to develop its models to further refine experience-focused features including Magical Listing, Explore and Shop the Look. \"We will also leverage these models to touch more parts of the consumer experience this year to make it more modern and seamless,\" Iannone said during the call.\n\n**OpenAI Partnership:**\nIn January, eBay began collaborating with OpenAI Operator, Iannone said. Operator is an AI agent that OpenAI says can open its own browser to perform tasks for users. \"This agentic approach to ecommerce could create an entirely new channel for discovery and shopping online,\" Iannone said. \"Although it's early days, we anticipate this collaboration could expand the reach of our sellers, giving more buyers exposure to eBay's unique and differentiated inventory.\n\n**Automotive Expansion:**\nHe said a driver in eBay's GMV turnaround has been \"reestablishing eBay as a trusted place to shop for auto parts.\" He added that eBay's acquisition of Caramel has helped with that. Caramel is an online platform for vehicle transactions. Starting in the online marketplace's fiscal Q1, he said, U.S. sellers will be able to list cars, trucks and motorcycles on eBay using Caramel's end-to-end checkout solution.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Focus Categories Strategy:**\nAfter unsuccessful forays into fulfillment services and low-value customer segments, the company has prioritized its bread-and-butter focus categories, with expansion into authentication services, tuck-in acquisitions, and vertical investments driving healthy growth for eBay's most distinct inventory. Those categories now represent 30% of gross merchandise volume, or GMV, and disproportionately cater to the 16 million high-value \"enthusiast\" buyers who funnel more than $3,100 in annual spending toward the commerce platform each year.\n\n**Enthusiast-Focused Approach:**\nNot only do they shop more often and spend more, but eBay enthusiasts have the added benefit of being incredibly loyal, according to Thomas Walker, VP of Global Consumer Insights at eBay: \"We know enthusiasts stick around when they find [a platform] that delivers against their needs,\" he shared at eBay Open. \"This demonstrates just how important they are to driving long-term sustainable growth.\"\n\n**AI and Technology Investments:**\neBay's investment in artificial intelligence is no longer speculative—it's operational. The rollout of its \"Magical Listing\" AI tool has streamlined the seller experience, reducing listing times by 40% and improving buyer engagement. This tool, combined with the launch of the \"Operator\" agent (a collaboration with OpenAI), positions eBay to redefine e-commerce workflows.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Seller Base:**\neBay last disclosed its active seller numbers in Q1 2021, reporting 20 million global sellers (25 million in 2014).\n\n**Major Partnership Relationships:**\n- eBay has 357 partners, 273 are technology partners and 84 are channel partners. Salesforce is its largest partner.\n- eBay partnered with Meta to integrate listings on Facebook Marketplace in the U.S., Germany, and France, increasing seller visibility and access to new buyers.\n- Since launching in December 2024, there have been over half a million eBay listings generated through Klarna's app. Since launching in the U.K., Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain in December 2024, eBay shoppers are splitting up payments to access higher-ticket items—like a pre-loved luxury watch—in a more affordable, manageable way.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Results:**\n- Revenue of $2.6 billion, up 1% on an as-reported and FX-Neutral basis. GMV was $19.3 billion, up 4% on an as-reported basis and up 3% on an FX-Neutral basis.\n- GAAP net income from continuing operations was $680 million, or $1.40 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $607 million, or $1.25 per diluted share.\n- GAAP and Non-GAAP operating margins were 21.1% and 27.0%, respectively.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Performance:**\n- Revenue was $10.3 billion, up 2% on an as-reported and FX-Neutral basis.\n- Also for the full-year fiscal 2024, eBay GMV grew 1% to $74.7 billion.\n\n**Q1 2025 Results:**\n- Revenue of $2.6 billion, up 1% on an as-reported basis and up 2% on an FX-Neutral basis\n- eBay started 2025 with $2.6 billion in revenue, up 1% on an as-reported basis and up 2% on an FX-neutral basis, and Gross Merchandise Volume of $18.8 billion, up 2% on an FX-neutral basis.\n\n**Capital Returns:**\nIn Q1 2025, the company generated $644 million in free cash flow and returned $759 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With $6.2 billion in cash and a $2.7 billion buyback program remaining, eBay has the flexibility to weather volatility while rewarding investors.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Competition: eBay faces intense competition from other e-commerce giants like Amazon, which can impact its market share.\n- eBay expects \"uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and de minimis changes\" in 2025. With tariffs factored in, eBay expects to generate low-single-digit growth to its gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2025.\n- As sellers and buyers adjust to the new trade policies, we are seeing an uptick in returned and canceled orders, which led to a roughly 10 basis point headwind to our Q3 take rate as these transactions are included in GMV, but not revenue.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- eBay's thesis is that recommerce transforms how people live, allowing them to save money to prioritize experiences over excessive consumption, pursue their passions to turn dreams into reality, and redirect resources toward what truly matters to them. Besides that, recommerce also helps the planet. eBay users say the primary reason they buy pre-loved is to save money where they need it most and protect our world.\n- A remarkable 60% of eBay buyers globally say buying pre-loved goods has become more important to them.\n- By leveraging opportunities in mobile commerce, emerging markets, and technological advancements, eBay can continue to thrive.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**U.S. E-commerce Position:**\nIndustry records dating back to 2023 estimate that eBay holds a 3.5% market share of the U.S. retail eCommerce market, ranking it as the fourth-largest online retailer behind Amazon (37.8%), Walmart (6.3%), and Apple (3.9%).\n\n**Global Presence:**\neBay operates in 190+ markets globally and has over 2.3 billion active listings on the platform, up 15% from 2023.\n\n**Market Ranking:**\nEBay ranks No. 6 in Digital Commerce 360's Global Online Marketplaces Database.

The platform emphasizes pre-owned goods, collectibles, and enthusiast categories where its auction format and specialized seller base provide distinct value.\n\n**Key Competitors by Category:**\n- **Fashion Resale:** Poshmark, Depop, Vinted\n- **Collectibles:** WhatNot, StockX/GOAT\n- **General E-commerce:** Amazon, Walmart Marketplace, Mercari\n\n## 11.

Strategic partnerships with major brands and retailers help expand inventory and attract professional sellers. eBay also collaborates with government agencies and law enforcement for regulatory compliance and fraud prevention. These partnerships enhance the platform's value proposition, reduce operational costs, and expand service capabilities, ultimately supporting higher transaction volumes and revenue generation through improved user experience and trust.\n\n**Investment Activities:**\nIn addition to the recent acquisition in fashion, eBay Ventures invested $300,000 in Refiberd, a U.S. startup using AI for sustainable textile recycling, showcasing eBay's commitment to advancing textile-to-textile recycling solutions at scale.\n\n## 12.

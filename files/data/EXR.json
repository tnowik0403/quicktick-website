(NYSE: EXR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $162.45 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close October 10, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $34.42 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of October 10, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nExtra Space Storage Inc. (EXR) is one of the largest owners and operators of self-storage properties in the United States, functioning as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the company owns or has investments in approximately 3,700 self-storage properties comprising over 285 million rentable square feet across 42 states as of Q2 2024. EXR provides affordable, accessible storage solutions for residential and commercial customers, including climate-controlled units, vehicle storage, and business storage services. Its business model emphasizes high occupancy (typically 90%+), revenue growth through rate increases, and operational efficiencies via proprietary technology like the StoreIt app for remote access and payments.\n\nEXR differentiates through a tenant insurance program (via wholly-owned subsidiary), third-party management of non-owned properties (adding ~1.5 million sq ft), and a focus on premium locations in high-density urban/suburban markets. The 2023 merger with Life Storage expanded its footprint, making it the second-largest player behind Public Storage. Revenue is primarily from rental income (95%+), with ancillary fees from insurance, administration, and late fees. EXR pays a quarterly dividend (~$1.62/share annualized yield ~4%) and has a strong balance sheet with investment-grade credit ratings (BBB from S&P). The self-storage sector benefits from inelastic demand tied to life events (moves, downsizing), low capex needs (2-3% of revenue), and barriers to entry like land scarcity.

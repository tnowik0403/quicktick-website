It specializes in the production, marketing, and distribution of premium fresh citrus (primarily lemons), avocados, and other crops including oranges, pistachios, and olives. The company owns or leases approximately 12,800 acres of groves across California, Arizona, Florida, Chile, and Argentina, enabling year-round supply. Limoneira operates a comprehensive supply chain: it grows fruit, packs and markets it under its flagship Limoneira® brand (emphasizing sustainability and premium quality), and sells to North American retailers, foodservice, and international markets. Beyond agriculture, it develops real estate on excess land, including 532 residential units completed or under construction as of FY2023.  \n\nFinancially, Limoneira reported FY2023 revenues of $180.1 million (down from $182.2 million in FY2022), with a net loss of $28.4 million due to low lemon prices and harvest challenges. In Q1 FY2025 (ended January 31, 2024; reported March 7, 2024), revenues fell 26% YoY to $38.4 million, with gross margins at 22.9% (up from 17.4%), but EPS loss of $0.76/share. The company focuses on sustainability (e.g., regenerative agriculture, water efficiency) and diversification into higher-margin avocados and real estate. With a current stock price of $14.20 (as of October 10, 2024, close; source: Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq), market cap stands at $256.3 million, positioning LMNR as a small-cap play in the specialty produce sector amid volatile commodity cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Earnings**: Q1 FY2025 (reported March 7, 2024) showed revenues $38.4M (-26% YoY), gross profit $8.8M (margin 22.9%), net loss $13.6M or $0.76/share.

Stable/decline risk if water issues persist (-2% possible).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q1 FY25) | LMNR | CVGW (Calavo) | AVO (Mission Produce) | FMC (Fresh Del Monte) |\n|----------------------------|------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Revenue | $170M | $1.03B | $3.0B | $4.3B |\n| Gross Margin | 23% | 12% | 18% | 15% |\n| Market Cap (Oct 10, 2024) | $256M | $425M | $980M | $1.3B |\n| EV/EBITDA | 15x | 10x | 12x | 8x |\n| YTD Stock Perf. | -15% | -20% | +5% | -10% |\n| **Edge** | Premium branding, real estate kicker | Scale in avocados | Global distribution | Bananas/diversification |\n\nLMNR trades at discount on P/S (1.5x vs. peers 1.8x) due to losses, but superior margins signal recovery.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Sunkist Growers (marketing co-op); Walmart/Kroger (exclusive supply); FreshRealm (prepared foods JV).\n- **M&A**: Acquired 1,200-acre CA groves (2022, $50M); sold AZ pistachio assets (2023).

Solid growth from diversification/real estate offsets ag volatility; undervalued vs. peers for moderate-risk growth investors.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $22.00/share (55% upside). Based on 1.8x P/S on $200M FY25 revenue est., 10% FCF yield post-recovery, DCF with 8% growth/12x EBITDA (peers-adjusted). Moderate risk: Weather/commodity beta balanced by assets.",

Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, the company operates a network of 13 ethanol production plants primarily in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Tennessee, with a combined annual production capacity of approximately 1.46 billion gallons of ethanol (as per 2023 10-K). It is one of the largest ethanol producers in North America, emphasizing a transition from commodity ethanol to higher-value, low-carbon products. Core segments include Agribusiness & Energy Solutions (ethanol production, distillers grains, corn oil, ultra-high protein via Sequence subsidiary) and more recently, a pivot toward sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks and carbon capture. Founded in 2004, Green Plains has evolved from a pure-play ethanol producer to a diversified biorefiner, procuring over 300 million bushels of grain annually and operating grain handling facilities. The company aims to leverage decarbonization trends, with initiatives like carbon sequestration and premium protein products positioning it for growth in renewable energy and food markets amid ethanol demand from E15/E85 blends and SAF mandates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 7, 2024)**: Net loss of $52.8M or ($0.82) per diluted share; revenues $4.0B (down 15% YoY); adjusted EBITDA $28.2M.

Fundamentals improving (margin recovery, tech upside) but headwinds (debt, ethanol glut) cap near-term; suitable for moderate risk with 20-30% growth potential if SAF/CCUS deliver.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $22.00 (57% upside from $14.07). Based on 6x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($300M consensus, TipRanks) + 20% premium for growth initiatives; DCF implies $20-25 assuming 10% EBITDA CAGR.",

(LDI) is a leading digital-first non-bank consumer lending platform founded in 2010 and headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. The company primarily originates and services residential mortgages, home equity loans, and personal loans through its proprietary technology platform, emphasizing a seamless online experience. Since inception, loanDepot has funded over $400 billion in loans, with a focus on purchase and refinance mortgages. It operates via direct-to-consumer channels (mello platform), retail branches, and wholesale partnerships. In recent years, loanDepot has pivoted toward non-qualified mortgage (non-QM) products, personal loans (via Launch platform), and single-family rental (SFR) financing to diversify beyond interest-rate-sensitive originations. As of Q2 2024, it services ~$60 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB) after selling bulk MSR portfolios. The company employs ~6,000 people and targets millennials/gen-Z with tech-driven tools like AI-powered affordability calculators.

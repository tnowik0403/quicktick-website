Founded in 1981, SMA specializes in hardware and software for converting DC electricity from solar panels into grid-compatible AC power, alongside battery storage systems, monitoring platforms, and comprehensive energy management services. The company operates through three main segments: Home Solutions (residential inverters and storage), Commercial & Industrial (C&I mid-sized systems), and Utility (large-scale power plants). With a strong emphasis on digitalization and grid stability, SMA's Sunny Portal and ennexOS platforms provide cloud-based monitoring and virtual power plant (VPP) capabilities. In 2023, SMA generated €1.97 billion in revenue, holding a significant position in the fragmented global PV inverter market (estimated 10-12% share). The firm benefits from the accelerating energy transition, particularly in Europe and the US, but faces headwinds from oversupply in residential segments. SMA's innovation focus includes AI-driven yield optimization and sector coupling (integrating PV with heat pumps and EVs). As a pure-play solar tech provider, it serves over 100 countries, with ~3,300 employees and R&D centers in Germany, China, and the US.

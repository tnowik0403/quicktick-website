Headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, AGCO operates through four main segments: North America, Europe/Africa/Middle East (EAME), South America, and Asia/Pacific/Australia. Its portfolio includes tractors, combines, harvesters, sprayers, hay and forage equipment, seeding/planting tools, tillage, and grain storage/handling systems. Iconic brands include Massey Ferguson (global workhorse tractors), Fendt (high-end precision tractors), Valtra (Nordic-focused), Challenger (tracked equipment), and GSI (grain systems). AGCO emphasizes \"farmer-first\" innovation via its AGCO Ventures and Fuse digital platform, integrating data analytics, telematics, and automation for optimized farming.\n\nWith ~28,000 employees and manufacturing in 20+ countries, AGCO serves over 140 countries through a dealer network of 3,000+ locations. In 2023, it generated $14.4B in net sales (per 2023 10-K). The company focuses on sustainable agriculture amid global food demand growth (projected +50% by 2050 per FAO), leveraging precision ag to boost yields 10-20%. Recent challenges include industry destocking and weak farm economics, but AGCO's 10-12% global market share positions it for recovery via tech differentiation.

Top 10 dealers ~30% sales.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold with Upside Bias)**. Undervalued at 7x P/E amid cyclical trough (sector trough pricing); strong balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA 1.2x), 4% yield. Growth via ag tech offsets 2024 weakness; expect 10-15% EPS rebound 2025 on inventory normalization.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $135/share (20% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth; aligns with Barclays/Jefferies PTs $130-140). Suited for moderate-risk growth portfolios targeting ag recovery.

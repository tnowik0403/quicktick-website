Potential for scale tuck-ins (analyst speculation: BofA Oct 2024 note).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft – 40% revenue); Utilities (NextEra, Duke – 30%); Corporates (Walmart).\n- **Potential Clients**: Meta, Apple expansions; federal via DOE grants; EV firms (ChargePoint pilots).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy for growth upside). Rationale: 25% AUM growth, IRA tailwinds, undervalued at 12x P/FFO vs. peers/historical 15x; 20-30% upside potential amid AI energy demand. Moderate risk via low leverage, but policy/execution sensitivities.\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: $52 (12-18 month horizon; implies 32% upside). Based on 14x 2025 FFO ($3.70/share, consensus), DCF (8% discount rate, 4% terminal), and 25% AUM growth to $20B by 2026. Hold below $45; sell only sub-$30 on macro downturn. \n\n*Sources: HASI Q3 2024 Earnings (11/7/24), 10-Q; Yahoo Finance/NASDAQ (11/7/24); Seeking Alpha transcripts; Bloomberg; Jefferies/BofA reports (Oct/Nov 2024).

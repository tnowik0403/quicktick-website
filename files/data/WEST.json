(WST) is a global leader in designing and manufacturing advanced packaging products and delivery systems for injectable drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, the company operates through two segments: Proprietary Products (73% of 2023 sales) and Contract-Manufactured Products. Proprietary offerings include high-value, innovative solutions like Crystal Zenith® cyclic olefin polymer (COP) syringes/vials, which offer superior biocompatibility over glass; SmartDose® electronic wearable injectors; and Pec® self-injection platforms tailored for GLP-1 therapies (e.g., semaglutide). Contract-manufactured products provide essential elastomer components such as rubber stoppers, seals, and plungers used in vials and prefilled syringes. West serves the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, capitalizing on rising demand for biologics, vaccines, and self-administered therapies amid an aging population and chronic disease prevalence. With 18,800 employees and manufacturing sites across the US, Europe (Ireland, Germany), and Asia (Singapore, China), West emphasizes sterile fill-finish compatibility, regulatory compliance (FDA, EMA), and sustainability via reduced-breakage polymer tech. In 2023, it generated $2.95B revenue, driven by 12%+ organic growth in high-margin proprietary systems.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 24, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings release – Revenue $855.1M (+7.4% YoY), gross margin 42.3%, operating income $193.3M, net income $142.9M, diluted EPS $1.93 (adjusted EPS $2.22).

Ideal for growth portfolios with moderate risk (beta 1.1, low debt).\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $385** – Based on 38x 2025E EPS ($10.10), implying 25% upside. DCF (10% WACC, 4% terminal) supports $370-400; aligns with 15% EPS CAGR to 2028. Hold if price >$350.",

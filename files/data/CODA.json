(CODA) is a global leader in underwater technologies, specializing in the design, development, and manufacture of high-performance 3D/4D sonar systems, acoustic positioning technology, and diver augmentation systems. Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Orlando, Florida, with operations in the UK and Portugal, the company serves two primary segments: Marine Technology Business (MTB) and Automation & Control Technology Business (ACT). MTB provides real-time 3D/4D sonars like the Echoscope® and CodaOctopus® suite for underwater imaging, mapping, and survey applications in offshore energy, subsea construction, defense, and salvage operations. ACT focuses on diver handheld sonar (Fusion®) and diver communication systems. CODA's products enhance safety, efficiency, and precision in harsh underwater environments, with a strong emphasis on defense applications like mine countermeasures (MCM) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The company has delivered over 1,000 sonar systems worldwide, targeting commercial marine survey (60% revenue), defense (30%), and emerging autonomous vehicle markets. With a lean operation (approx. 70 employees), CODA emphasizes R&D innovation, holding key patents in volumetric sonar imaging. Revenue for FY2024 (ended Jan 31, 2024) was $22.6M, up from prior years, driven by defense contracts amid geopolitical tensions.

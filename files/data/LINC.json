Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, the company operates 10 campuses across eight states under brands like Lincoln Tech, Lincoln Culinary Institute, and Euphoria Institute of Beauty Arts & Sciences. Its core offerings focus on automotive technology, diesel/heavy equipment, collision repair, electrical and electronics, HVAC, welding, and culinary arts, with programs ranging from 7-18 months and designed for quick entry into high-demand jobs.\n\nLINC emphasizes industry-aligned curricula, partnerships with employers for job placement (average 80-85% placement rates), and a hybrid model blending in-person training with online components.

With a focus on underserved markets, LINC differentiates through Employer Advisory Boards, OEM certifications (e.g., Honda, BMW), and a 95%+ satisfaction rate in graduate surveys.

(ATMU) is a leading global provider of filtration solutions, specializing in highly engineered air, fuel, lube, hydraulic, and coolant filtration products for on-highway and off-highway commercial vehicles, industrial applications, and aviation. Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, the company was spun off from Cummins Inc. on August 17, 2023, via a tax-free distribution to Cummins shareholders, inheriting a ~$4.2 billion asset base focused on filtration. ATMU serves diverse end-markets including heavy-duty trucks (Class 8), construction/mining equipment, power generation, and aftermarket channels. Its products enhance engine performance, reduce emissions, and extend component life amid stringent global regulations like EPA Tier 4 and Euro VI. With ~5,400 employees across 25 countries, ATMU generates ~60% of revenue from aftermarket sales, providing high-margin recurring revenue. In 2023, total revenue was $1.67 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $339 million (20.3% margin). The company leverages proprietary technologies like StrataPore media and NanoNet for superior filtration efficiency, positioning it as a market leader in filtration media innovation. ATMU's focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) solutions differentiates it in a fragmented $20+ billion global filtration market, where it holds strong positions in heavy-duty diesel filtration.

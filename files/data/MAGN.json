(NASDAQ: MAGN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 14, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $14.62 (closing price as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.12 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024 close)  \n**52-Week Range:** $6.98 - $17.20  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 2.3 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nMagnite, Inc. is the world's largest independent sell-side advertising platform, enabling publishers to monetize content across connected TV (CTV), video, display, audio, and other formats through programmatic advertising. Formed via the 2020 merger of Rubicon Project and Telaria, Magnite connects over 1,800 premium publishers—including Disney, Paramount Global, and News Corp—with thousands of advertisers and demand-side platforms (DSPs) via its unified Magnite Platform. The company processes billions of ad transactions daily, focusing on header bidding, private marketplaces (PMPs), and real-time bidding to maximize publisher revenue while minimizing direct sales friction. Key strengths include its scale in CTV (fastest-growing ad segment), independence from walled gardens like Google and Meta, and tools like Magnite Console for streamlined yield management. Revenue is predominantly from transaction fees (net of traffic acquisition costs, or TAC), with ~85% from ex-TAC metrics. Magnite operates globally, with ~40% of revenue from outside North America, and emphasizes AI-driven optimization amid the shift to privacy-first advertising post-third-party cookie deprecation.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024):** Revenue $160.5 million (+7% YoY); ex-TAC revenue $131.0 million (+9% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $39.0 million (24% margin, +16% YoY).

Daily Volume**: 1.05 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 11.92\n- **Dividend Yield**: 2.02% (quarterly dividend of $0.06/share declared September 12, 2024, payable October 4, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview\nJanus International Group, Inc. (JBGS) is a premier provider of turn-key self-storage solutions in North America, designing, manufacturing, and distributing specialized products including roll-up doors, swing doors, hallway systems, and facility optimization software. Headquartered in Temple, Georgia, the company serves the self-storage industry, which manages over 2 billion square feet of rentable space across the U.S. Janus operates through three segments: Janus Core (doors and docking hardware, ~80% of revenue), Facilities Management (software like SiteLink and consulting, ~10%), and Building & Construction (STORIS-brand construction services, ~10%). With a focus on modular, wind-rated products for hurricane-prone regions, Janus holds a dominant position as the #1 provider of self-storage doors in the U.S., benefiting from the sector's fragmentation and high barriers to entry due to customization and scale. The company has grown via organic expansion and bolt-on M&A, achieving scale with 17 manufacturing facilities and a nationwide installer network. In a maturing self-storage market valued at ~$50B annually, Janus leverages recurring revenue from parts/services (20-25% of sales) and software subscriptions, positioning it for resilience amid supply chain normalization post-COVID.

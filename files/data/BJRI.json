(BJRI) is a casual dining restaurant chain operating under the BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse brand, specializing in a distinctive menu of deep-dish pizzas made with a unique Tavern-Cut style, handcrafted beers brewed in-house, and a broad array of American comfort foods including pastas, burgers, salads, and shareable appetizers. Founded in 1978 in Santa Ana, California, the company has grown to 218 locations across 28 states as of Q2 2024, primarily in the Western and Southern U.S., with expansion into the Midwest and Southeast. BJ's emphasizes a \"higher-end casual dining\" experience with extensive craft beer offerings (over 12 proprietary beers on tap at most locations), vibrant atmospheres, and value-driven promotions.

In fiscal 2023, BJRI reported total revenues of $1.38 billion, positioning it as a niche player in the fragmented casual dining sector valued at ~$100 billion annually.

(QIPT) is a North American leader in integrated home medical equipment (HME) and respiratory care services, focusing on patients with chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and sleep apnea. Headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, with operations across 35+ U.S. states and Ontario, Canada, Quipt provides end-to-end care including diagnosis, prescription management, equipment provisioning, remote patient monitoring (RPM), and ongoing clinical support. Its model emphasizes high-acuity patients requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV), oxygen therapy, and positive airway pressure (PAP) devices, differentiating it from commoditized HME providers.\n\nThe company operates through two segments: (1) **Orthotics** (bracing and supports, ~5-10% of revenue) and (2) **HME** (core respiratory services, ~90-95%). Quipt's proprietary RPM platform, Quipt Connect, uses telehealth and data analytics to improve patient adherence (claimed 90%+ rates vs. industry 50-60%) and reduce hospital readmissions, aligning with value-based care trends. Founded in 2019 via reverse takeover, Quipt has grown aggressively through 15+ tuck-in acquisitions, scaling revenue from $37M in FY2020 to projected ~$230M+ in FY2024. It serves ~100,000 patients annually, billing primarily Medicare (60-70%), Medicaid, and commercial payers. Recent focus on \"anchor geographies\" (e.g., Florida, Texas) drives organic growth amid U.S. home health shift post-COVID.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 FY2024 earnings – Revenue $61.0M (+47% YoY), Adjusted EBITDA $11.3M (23.4% margin, +110% YoY), patient base +37% to 84,000.

Company Overview\n\nSterling Infrastructure, Inc. engages in the provision of e-infrastructure, transportation, and building solutions in the United States. It operates through three segments: E-Infrastructure Solutions, Transportation Solutions, and Building Solutions. The company was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, and was formerly known as Sterling Construction Company, Inc. and changed its name to Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. in June 2022.\n\nSterling has strategically evolved from a traditional construction company into a specialized infrastructure services provider with particular strength in mission-critical projects. Sterling is playing a critical role in building the manufacturing production coming back to the U.S., the data infrastructure that enables artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies, critical transportation infrastructure, and the homes we live in. The company's strategic transformation positions it as a key enabler of America's infrastructure modernization.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nSterling operates through three main business segments:\n\n**E-Infrastructure Solutions:**\nThe E-Infrastructure Solutions segment provides site development services for the blue-chip end users in the e-commerce distribution center, data center, manufacturing, warehousing, and power generation sectors. E-Infrastructure Solutions provides advanced, large-scale site development services and mission-critical electrical services for data centers, semiconductor fabrication, manufacturing, distribution centers, warehousing, power generation and more.\n\n**Transportation Solutions:**\nThe Transportation Solutions segment is involved in the development of infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, rail, and storm drainage systems for the departments of transportation, regional transit, airport, port, water, and railroads authorities.\n\n**Building Solutions:**\nThe Building Solutions segment provides residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking structures, elevated slabs, other concrete work for developers and general contractors, as well as provides plumbing and surveys services for residential builds.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nSterling's expansion strategy centers around strategic acquisitions and enhanced service capabilities:\n\n**Recent CEC Facilities Group Acquisition (Completed September 2025):**\nSterling Infrastructure completed its previously announced acquisition of Irving, Texas-based CEC Facilities Group, LLC, et al. (\"CEC\"), a leading specialty electrical and mechanical contractor. CEC is a leading, non-union electrical contractor to high-growth, mission-critical markets. CEC delivers comprehensive design, engineering, installation, and maintenance services for complex electrical infrastructure across high growth sectors.\n\n**Expected CEC Contributions:**\nEstimated CEC full-year 2025 revenues of approximately $390 to $415 million. Estimated CEC full-year 2025 EBITDA of $51 to $54 million. Estimated CEC full-year 2025 adjusted EPS accretion of approximately $0.63 to $0.70 per fully diluted share.\n\n**Expansion into Electrical Services Platform:**\nOpportunity to grow the electrical services platform, both organically and through M&A. The acquisition enables CEC's service offerings extend to ongoing maintenance, retrofit, and upgrade needs, allowing Sterling to touch the full project lifecycle.\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nSterling's growth strategy is built on several key pillars:\n\n**Strategic Market Focus:**\nIn Q1 2025, E-Infrastructure Solutions accounted for 51% of revenue and 65% of the company's $2.13 billion backlog. Data center revenue alone saw over a 50% increase year-over-year. The E-Infrastructure Solutions backlog exceeded $1 billion by the end of 2024, marking a 27% year-over-year increase. Data center construction represents over 65% of this backlog, indicating strong demand in this sector.\n\n**Acquisitions and Expansion:**\nIn Q1 2025, Sterling completed the acquisition of Drake Concrete, LLC, for $25 million plus an earn-out. This strengthens the Building Solutions segment and expands the company's footprint in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.\n\n**Market Repositioning:**\nSterling Infrastructure is strategically moving away from low-bid heavy highway work in Texas. This shift is intended to improve margins throughout 2025, while maintaining strong demand in core regions like the Rocky Mountains and Arizona.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nSterling serves blue-chip clients across its key segments, particularly in mission-critical infrastructure:\n\n**E-Infrastructure Clients:**\nThe company serves hyperscaler cloud and AI companies in data center development. Unlike hyperscalers like Amazon or Microsoft, which compete for AI market share, STRL enables their operations by providing the physical and electrical infrastructure needed to deploy AI at scale.\n\n**CEC Client Base:**\nOver 80% of CEC revenue and backlog comes from mission-critical end markets including semiconductor (its largest end market), data center, and manufacturing.\n\n**Geographic Focus:**\nCEC has a strong presence in Texas, with services extending into the Rocky Mountain region, Southwest, and Southeast.\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Financial Results (Most Recent):**\n- Revenues of $689.0 million. Revenues increased 32% excluding RHB from the prior year quarter.\n- Net income of $92.1 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, increases of 50% and 51%, respectively, and a new third quarter record.\n- Gross margin of 24.7%, up from 21.9%.\n- Adjusted EBITDA rose 47% year over year to $155.8 million\n\n**Key Financial Metrics:**\n- The current Sterling Infrastructure(STRL) stock price is $361.21, with a market capitalization of 11.1B. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.46.\n- Its current market cap is $11.6B with 30.7M shares. As of 30-Sep-2025, Sterling Infrastructure has a trailing 12-month revenue of $2.23B.\n\n**2025 Full-Year Guidance (Updated):**\n- We are raising our 2025 guidance to reflect our strong year-to-date performance, backlog, and visibility into future phase opportunities. The midpoints of our revised 2025 guidance would represent 27% year-over-year revenue growth as adjusted for RHB, 47% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth and 42% adjusted EBITDA growth\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Key Tailwinds:**\n- **AI and Data Center Boom:** Goldman Sachs projects $1 trillion in data center power demand by 2030, with AI accounting for 27% of needs by 2027, creating opportunities for STRL's grid solutions.\n- **Infrastructure Investment:** Goldman Sachs estimates that $720 billion in grid infrastructure spending will be needed by 2030 to support data centers, a market STRL is well-positioned to serve.\n- **Market Position:** The company's ability to efficiently manage complex, mission-critical projects and consistently deliver high-quality outcomes has made it a trusted partner for data-center developers. With E-Infrastructure projects becoming an increasingly strategic focus, sustained data-center demand appears to be a key driver supporting the company's margin strength.\n\n**Key Headwinds:**\n- **Labor Market Constraints:** CEC locks NASDAQ:STRL into a tight labor market for highly specialized electrical and mechanical teams.

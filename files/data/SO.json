Existing Products/Services\n\nThe Southern Company (Southern Company) is a holding company. The Company owns all of the stock of the traditional electric operating companies and the parent entities of Southern Power Company (Southern Power) and Southern Company Gas, and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company owns all of the common stock of Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), each of which is an operating public utility company. The primary business of the Southern Company system is electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. The Company's segments include Gas distribution operations, Gas marketing services, Wholesale gas services, Gas Pipeline investments and All other.\n\nSubsidiary Southern Power owns 13 gigawatts of natural gas generation and renewable energy across the US and sells the electricity primarily under long-term contracts. Southern Power's solar generating portfolio will total more than 2,920 MW. Southern Power's solar facilities are a part of the company's 5,450 MW renewable fleet, which consists of 30 solar and 15 wind facilities operating, planned or under construction.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nSouthern Nuclear marked a pivotal moment for nuclear reliability in April 2025 by installing advanced Lead Test Assemblies at Plant Vogtle Unit 2—the first U.S. commercial reactor to use uranium enrichments above historical limits. Engineers loaded the old reactor with a new type of uranium fuel enriched above the traditional threshold and designed to withstand all kinds of accidents, last longer without refueling, and generate less radioactive waste. It's the first time in U.S. history a commercial reactor is running on fuel enriched above 5%. That may not sound like much, but many industry analysts recognize the redesigned uranium fuel as a monumental step change for the nuclear sector. \"This is enabling us to get more out of those existing reactors than in the past,\" Jonathan Chavers, Southern's director of nuclear fuel and analysis, told Fortune exclusively.\n\nSouthern Company is investing in battery energy storage systems (BESS) to help ensure reliability during peak demand. Alabama Power is building the state's first ever utility-scale BESS facility with 150 MW capacity, equivalent to the capacity needed to power about 9,000 homes. In Georgia, following the construction of its first BESS facility in 2024, Georgia Power has projected 765 MW of new battery storage capacity by 2026.\n\nGeorgia Power and Mitsubishi Power achieved a global milestone at Plant McDonough-Atkinson by successfully blending hydrogen and natural gas at up to 50% on an advanced-class gas turbine—the largest test of its kind in the world. This breakthrough reduces carbon emissions by approximately 22% compared to 100% natural gas and demonstrates the potential of hydrogen to power a cleaner energy future.\n\nTo prepare for the future, Southern Company is planning to invest more than $80 billion over the next five years to strengthen the grid and deploy advanced technologies that make our system more resilient.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nSouthern Company is experiencing one of the most significant periods of growth in its history. Electric sales are projected to grow by 8% annually through 2029, driven by unprecedented projected energy demand from data centers, advanced manufacturing, and residential expansion across our footprint. This historic opportunity requires bold action, and we are ready.\n\nEven as we rise to meet this challenge, affordability remains our top priority. Georgia Power will freeze base electric rates (excluding storm costs) through 2028, and Alabama Power will keep rates steady through 2027, giving families and businesses predictability at a time when many other costs are rising.\n\nBased on our research and planning, shareholder and stakeholder dialogues, we believe our path to net zero by 2050 will be achieved through: Using natural gas to enable transition to lower emitting generating fleet · Expanding zero-carbon resources, including renewables and nuclear. We are also growing our investment in renewable energy, modernizing the grid to take full advantage of new technology, using natural gas to support our transition to a lower emitting generating fleet, building new nuclear generating units, continuing our robust research and development (R&D) efforts and investing in energy efficiency.\n\n## 6.

Recent Developments\n\nTheFly reported on December 16, 2025, that as part of its 2026 outlook for the utilities group, Morgan Stanley downgraded The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) from Equal Weight to Underweight and reduced its price objective to $81 from $97. According to the firm's research report, utility share performance is forecast to be driven by data centers and growth upside in 2026, with no slowdown in activity or alleviation of grid tightness. The rating adjustment and lowered valuation forecast were caused in part by Morgan Stanley's advice to investors to steer clear of political and regulatory risk, especially during an election year.\n\nThe firm expressed concern that a Democrat-majority commission could lead to \"more efforts to manage customer bills\" and potentially \"less predictable regulatory outcomes\" for Southern Co. While acknowledging Southern Co has taken proactive steps by establishing new data center contracts that offer customer bill offsets in coming years, Morgan Stanley indicated these measures would likely be insufficient to overcome investor concerns surrounding the election.\n\nSouthern Company's electric operating companies were named Top Utilities in Economic Development by Site Selection magazine. Georgia Power marked its 27th consecutive year on the list, helping create nearly 17,000 jobs and $9.1 billion in investments. Alabama Power supported projects totaling $3.1 billion and 2,900 jobs, while Mississippi Power attracted major investments, including Compass Datacenters' $10 billion project in Meridian.\n\n## 12.

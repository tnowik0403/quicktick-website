(NASDAQ: TCMD) is a medical technology company specializing in insulin delivery systems for people with diabetes. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Tandem designs, develops, and sells advanced automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, primarily tubed insulin pumps integrated with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. Its flagship product, the t:slim X2 insulin pump, is the smallest and thinnest durable pump available, featuring a color touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, and compatibility with third-party CGMs from Dexcom and Abbott. Tandem's systems emphasize user-friendly automation via algorithms like Control-IQ, which predict glucose levels and adjust insulin delivery to reduce hypoglycemia and improve time-in-range (TIR). The company targets both type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes patients, with a focus on expanding into pediatrics and international markets.\n\nTandem's business model revolves around hardware sales (pumps), recurring disposable consumables (cartridges, infusion sets), and software updates. It has shipped over 500,000 pumps lifetime and benefits from partnerships enabling CGM interoperability under FDA approvals. In 2023, the company reported $599M in revenue, driven by U.S. growth amid rising diabetes prevalence (affecting 38M+ Americans). Recent innovations position Tandem in the $7B+ global insulin pump market, competing in a sector shifting toward hybrid closed-loop systems. Challenges include reimbursement hurdles and competition, but tailwinds from obesity drugs like GLP-1s (e.g., Ozempic) could expand insulin-dependent populations. Tandem went public in 2013 and employs ~1,400 people, emphasizing R&D with 20%+ of revenue invested.

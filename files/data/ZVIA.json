It specializes in zero-calorie, zero-sugar carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), energy drinks, sparkling waters, and mixers sweetened exclusively with stevia leaf extract—a plant-based, non-GMO alternative to artificial sweeteners like aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup. Zevia positions itself as \"America's #1 better-for-you soda,\" targeting health-conscious consumers seeking natural, low-carb options amid rising obesity concerns and sugar reduction trends. Products are distributed nationwide via grocery chains (e.g., Whole Foods, Kroger), convenience stores (e.g., 7-Eleven), mass retailers (e.g., Walmart), and e-commerce (Amazon). With 15+ SKUs across categories, Zevia emphasizes non-jittery energy drinks and kid-friendly options. In 2023, it generated $157M in net sales, but faces volume declines in a competitive $90B+ U.S. CSD market shifting toward functional beverages. Recent focus: portfolio optimization, distribution expansion (now in 40,000+ points of sale), and marketing via social media influencers and events. Challenges include premium pricing ($2-3/can vs. $1 for Coke) limiting mass appeal, but tailwinds from GLP-1 weight-loss drugs (e.g., Ozempic) boosting zero-sugar demand.

Speculation on acquisition by PepsiCo (X chatter Oct 2024).\n- **Major Clients:** Walmart (10% sales), Target, Whole Foods, 7-Eleven, Amazon. Potential: More club (Costco trials), international (Canada/Mexico pilots per Q2).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** 100% plant-based sweetener; B Corp certified; recyclable cans.\n- **Risks:** Supply chain (stevia from China); litigation (class action on \"natural\" claims dismissed 2023).\n- **Sentiment:** Mixed – analysts (2 Buy, 3 Hold; avg PT $2.50, BofA Oct 2024 downgrade to Underperform); retail bullish on turnaround.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 4/10 (**Hold/Sell**) – Declining volumes and execution risks outweigh distribution wins; sector tailwinds intact but ZVIA lags hyper-growth peers like Poppi/Olipop. Moderate risk appetite suits waiting for H2 inflection.\n- **Fair Value Price Target:** $1.80 (12-month; implies 65% upside). Based on 1.2x 2025E EV/sales ($90M rev est.), 20% discount to functional peers for soda exposure. Strong growth upside requires Q3 beat and energy acceleration.",

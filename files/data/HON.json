(HON) is a Fortune 100 multinational conglomerate headquartered in Charlotte, NC, specializing in high-technology solutions across four core segments: Aerospace Technologies (Aero), Building Technologies (BT), Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT), and Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS). With ~95,000 employees globally, Honeywell generates revenue by providing mission-critical systems for aviation, buildings, industrial processes, and worker safety. In Aerospace (~35% of sales), it leads in avionics, engines, and integrated systems for commercial, defense, and space applications. Building Technologies (~25%) focuses on automation, HVAC, and fire/security for commercial buildings. PMT (~20%) delivers advanced materials like UOP process tech for refining and fluorine products for semiconductors/EVs. SPS (~20%) offers warehouse automation, PPE, and productivity software.\n\nFounded in 1906, Honeywell has evolved through mergers (e.g., AlliedSignal in 1999) into a diversified industrial tech leader emphasizing digital transformation, sustainability, and aerospace recovery. In 2025, it reported record backlog of $34.5B (up 12% YoY per Q3 earnings), driven by commercial aerospace demand and AI-enabled efficiencies. The company invests heavily in R&D (~6% of sales, $3.7B in 2025), targeting megatrends like electrification, autonomy, and decarbonization. Despite cyclical exposures, its 2.4% dividend yield and 60+ years of increases underscore resilience.

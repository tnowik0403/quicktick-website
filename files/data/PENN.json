(PENN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $16.80 (Yahoo Finance, close as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.91B (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $10.11 - $30.80  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPenn Entertainment, Inc. (PENN) is a premier U.S.-based gaming, entertainment, and hospitality company operating in two primary segments: Retail and Interactive. In Retail, Penn owns and operates 43 gaming and racing properties across 20 jurisdictions, including iconic regional casinos like Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races (WV), Hollywood Casino Columbus (OH), and Margaritaville Resort Casino (LA). These facilities generate revenue through slot machines, table games, retail sportsbooks, and live entertainment, with a focus on regional markets underserved by Las Vegas-style resorts. The Interactive segment, launched in earnest with the ESPN BET app on November 14, 2023, provides digital sports betting and iGaming via a market-leading partnership with ESPN. This pivot followed the $2.0B acquisition and subsequent divestiture of Barstool Sports, aiming to capture the booming U.S. online gambling market legalized in 38 states for sports betting and 7 for iGaming as of Q2 2024. Penn's strategy emphasizes leveraging its dense regional footprint for cross-selling to digital users while investing heavily in ESPN BET's user acquisition amid intense competition. With ~20,000 employees, Penn reported trailing 12-month revenue of ~$6.7B (per latest filings), positioning it as a mid-tier player in a fragmented $15B+ U.S. commercial gaming sector growing at 8-10% CAGR driven by digital expansion. Challenges include high marketing spend and profitability ramps in Interactive, but tailwinds from sports league integrations and ESPN's 100M+ monthly viewers offer multi-year upside.

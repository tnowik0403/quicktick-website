Company Overview\n\nDollar General operates more than 20,000 convenient, easy-to-shop stores in 48 states, making it one of America's largest discount retail chains. Dollar General Corporation is an American chain of discount stores headquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Founded in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, the company changed its name to Dollar General Corporation in 1955 and went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1968.\n\nThe company delivers everyday low prices on items including food, snacks, health and beauty aids, cleaning supplies, basic apparel, housewares, seasonal items, paper products and much more from America's most-trusted brands and products, along with high-quality private brands. Dollar General's business model centers on delivering value and convenience by selling everyday items at low prices to customers looking for both value and convenience.\n\nSmall towns and rural communities, where the nearest big box retailers might be miles away, are Dollar General's core market. By placing itself close to customers who may not have many choices and offering convenience and affordable prices, the retailer has charted a successful path for growth.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe Dollar General Corporation stock price today is 148.86 as of January 20, 2026. As of January 2026 Dollar General has a market cap of $32.29 Billion USD.

Its market cap has increased by 96.87% in one year.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company offers consumable products, including paper towels, bath tissues, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, disinfectants, and laundry products; packaged food, such as cereals, pasta, canned soups, canned meats, fruits and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar, and flour; and perishables, including milk, eggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer, wine, and produce; candy, cookies, crackers, salty snacks, and carbonated beverages; over-the-counter medicines and personal care products.\n\nIt also provides seasonal products comprising holiday items, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, stationery, prepaid phones and accessories, gardening supplies, hardware, automotive, and home office supplies; home products include kitchen supplies, cookware, small appliances, light bulbs, storage containers, frames, candles, craft supplies and kitchen, and bed and bath soft goods; and apparel products for infants, toddlers, girls, boys, women and men, as well as socks, underwear, disposable diapers, shoes and accessories.\n\nPrivate brands include Clover Valley®, true living®, DG Home®, Studio Selection™, DG Health®, Comfort Bay®, Smart and Simple®, Gentle Steps, Rexall, Forever Pals, and more.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe discount retailer plans to execute approximately 4,730 new projects that include a full remodel of around 2,000 stores and the opening of 450 locations across the United States for fiscal 2026.\n\nBy 2026, a majority of stores have been outfitted with expanded cooler space. DG Wellbeing: Perhaps the most ambitious project, this initiative seeks to turn DG stores into rural healthcare destinations. The company has expanded its health and beauty assortments and continues to pilot mobile health clinics in partnership with companies like DocGo, offering basic diagnostics in \"medical deserts.\"\n\nWhile the company currently offers fresh produce in approximately 7,000 stores, it anticipates bringing this offering to more than 200 additional stores in 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nStarting with net sales, the company is targeting annual growth in the range of approximately 3.5% to 4%, including approximately 2% new unit growth, both of which they plan to begin in 2025.\n\nTurning to operating margin, they're targeting expansion to begin in 2026 and then longer term to continue expanding toward their goal in the range of approximately 6% to 7% as early as 2028. Finally, beginning in 2026, their long term financial framework seeks to deliver annual EPS growth of at least 10% on an adjusted basis.\n\nThe company sees significant runway for new store expansion, with approximately 11,000 opportunities for Dollar General stores in the U.S., and while they've always said that for a variety of reasons, they don't expect to capture every opportunity, they're excited about their ability to significantly grow their footprint in the years to come.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nDollar General serves a broad customer base, with target customers being households that make less than 40,000 annually. Approximately 80% of Dollar General stores are located in communities of 20,000 or fewer people, many of which other retailers either cannot, or have chosen not to serve.\n\nThere was growth in higher-income households, indicating the company is successfully expanding its customer base beyond its traditional low-income demographic.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent)\nNet sales increased 4.6% to $10.6 billion in Q3 2025 compared to $10.2 billion in Q3 2024. Same-store sales increased 2.5% during the quarter, driven by customer traffic.\n\nGross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 107 basis points to 29.9%, primarily due to higher inventory markups and lower shrink. Earnings per share for the quarter increased 43.8% to $1.28.\n\nSignificant cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion was generated year-to-date through Q3, representing an increase of 28%.\n\n### Fiscal 2025 Guidance\nFor fiscal 2025, Dollar General expects net sales growth of 4.7% to 4.9%, same-store sales growth of 2.5% to 2.7%, and EPS between $6.30 and $6.50.\n\n### Debt Management\nThe company has aggressively prioritized debt reduction, redeeming $1.1 billion in senior notes YTD, including $500 million of 4.15% notes and $600 million of 3.875% notes. The company plans to redeem an additional $550 million of their senior notes earlier than their November 2027 maturity.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\nAccording to JPMorgan, Dollar General has tailwinds in 2025 that will strengthen in 2026. A \"traffic trifecta\" of gainfully employed Americans, middle-income shoppers seeking value, and high-income earners trading down underpins store activity and revenue growth, bolstered by rising store counts and, soon, the impact of tax relief and lower interest rates.\n\nBenefits from tip and overtime tax changes will outweigh the effects of SNAP benefit changes, leaving lower-tier consumers with more disposable income for the necessities they can find at Dollar General.\n\n### Headwinds\nRisks include intensifying competition from Walmart, Target, or Aldi, as well as macro pressures like tariffs and inflation potentially eroding DG's value proposition against peers.\n\nLabor Market Shifts: Rising minimum wages in several states have pressured margins. As a company that relies on low-wage labor, any federal or regional push for a $15-$20 minimum wage could drastically alter the unit economics of a small-box store.\n\nInventory Shrink: Retail theft and inventory mismanagement (shrink) took a massive bite out of profits in 2023-2024. While the removal of self-checkouts in high-theft areas has helped, it remains a persistent industry-wide headwind.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nDollar General continues to have a larger dollar store market share compared to Dollar Tree, Inc, as Dollar General's customers buy more frequently and spend more per visit.\n\n79% of U.S. consumers shopped at Dollar Tree (including the Family Dollar banner) in 2024, compared with 60% at Dollar General. However, the average Dollar General shopper annually spent more, at $522, compared with Dollar Tree shoppers, who spent $290.\n\nDollar General grew market share in both consumable and non-consumable product sales.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nDollar General's top competitors are Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Big Lots, 99 Cents Only, Walmart, Target, Kroger, Walgreens, LIDL, Rite Aid, Five Below, Shopko Optical, Macy's, Freds, Ross Stores, Murphy USA, Best Buy, JCPenney, Bon-Ton and TJX.\n\nMost of Walmart's market share gains came from households with annual incomes of over $100,000. Warehouse clubs such as Costco and Walmart-owned Sam's Club, online players such as Amazon and Temu, and private label-focused grocers Aldi and Trader Joe's are also competing for — and sometimes stealing away the business of — price-conscious shoppers.\n\nDollar Tree's divestment of Family Dollar, its stronger same-store sales growth, and its clearer plans for broadening its reach among higher-income consumers make it a compelling investment. Dollar General's focus on rural areas limits its ability to attract more affluent customers.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nPartnerships with DoorDash and Uber Eats expanded delivery options to over 17,000 stores, contributing to larger basket sizes and high repeat visit rates.\n\nThe DG Media Network enables a more personalized experience for their unique customer base while delivering a higher return on ad spend for their partners. The digital advertising business continues to see double-digit growth in 2025, driven by new DG Media Network capabilities.\n\nDollar General has acquired 1 company in its history, though no recent major acquisitions have been announced.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Leadership Changes (December 2025)\nDollar General Corp. announced on Dec. 11 changes to its leadership ranks with the promotion of three executives across its business intelligence and store operations departments. Matthew Simonsen has transitioned into an expanded role as SVP of business intelligence and development.\n\n### Operational Improvements\nDollar General successfully reversed a critical operational headwind by reducing shrink expense by 38% in Q3, leading to a substantial 107 basis point gross margin expansion to 29.9%. This operational success, coupled with 2.5% same-store sales growth driven entirely by customer traffic, demonstrates the company's defensive market position.\n\n### Store Portfolio Review\nThe Company's operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 included charges of $232 million, primarily due to store closures as well as pOpshelf impairment charges. While the number of closings represents less than one percent of the overall store base, management believes this decision better positions them to serve customers and communities.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.3/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $155-165**\n\n### Investment Rationale:\n\n**Strengths Supporting the Rating:**\n- Strong operational turnaround with significant margin expansion (+107 bps gross margin improvement)\n- Aggressive but disciplined expansion plan (450 new stores in 2026)\n- Successful debt reduction strategy ($1.1B in debt retired YTD)\n- Dominant position in underserved rural markets with limited competition\n- Growing digital initiatives and media network showing strong growth\n- Management's \"Back to Basics\" strategy showing tangible results\n\n**Risk Factors Moderating the Rating:**\n- High debt load (~$7.5B) limiting financial flexibility\n- Exposure to low-income consumers vulnerable to economic headwinds\n- Intensifying competition from Walmart and other big-box retailers\n- Potential margin pressure from rising minimum wages\n- Ongoing inventory shrink challenges despite recent improvements\n\n**Valuation Justification:**\nCurrent trading multiple of ~18x forward earnings represents a discount to historical 22x average. The consensus among major analysts is currently a \"Buy,\" with a median 12-month price target of $142. Several large hedge funds that exited the stock in 2023 have begun rebuilding positions, citing the attractive valuation.\n\nGiven the successful operational turnaround, strong expansion pipeline, and defensive market position in rural America, the stock appears undervalued at current levels. The 7.3 rating reflects strong fundamentals with moderate risk considerations appropriate for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance.",

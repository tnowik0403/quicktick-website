Through its subsidiary First Horizon Bank, FHN delivers a broad range of financial services across the Southeast and Sunbelt regions, including 12 states with ~300 branches.

Post-2020 merger with IBERIABANK, FHN has ~$60B in loans and $65B in deposits, with a focus on high-growth Sunbelt markets (TX, FL, NC).

Risks: Election volatility, recession odds 25% (Fed Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold with Upside Bias)**: Attractive for growth (8-10% EPS CAGR 2025-2027 per consensus) amid NIM tailwinds and buybacks, but moderate CRE/regulatory risks cap to \"hold\" for conservative. Strong dividend supports income.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $20.50** (18% upside from $17.23): Based on 1.6x 2025E TBV ($12.80/share) + 10x fwd EPS ($2.05), aligning with peer avg post-rate cuts. Targets strong growth (Sunbelt/digital) with moderate risk (CET1 buffer). Sources: Bloomberg consensus, Q3 earnings models.",

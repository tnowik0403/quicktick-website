The increase was primarily driven by a $93.3 million increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue. Produced 1,406 bitcoin, as compared to 1,104 during the same three-month period in 2024.\n- Net income of $104.5 million or $0.26 Diluted EPS, as compared to a net loss of $154.4 million or $(0.54) Diluted EPS in the same three-month period in 2024.\n- Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $197.2 million for the quarter, which included a $133.1 million gain on Bitcoin held on the balance sheet.\n\n**Q2 2025 Results:**\n- Strong tailwinds in the price of bitcoin contributed to Riot achieving a record $219.5 million in net income and $495.3 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing exceptionally strong results for the quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet Strength:**\n- Maintained industry-leading financial position, with $170.0 million in working capital, including $330.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, and $75.6 million in restricted cash.\n- Held 19,287 bitcoin (of which 3,300 are currently held as collateral), equating to approximately $2.2 billion based on a market price for one bitcoin on September 30, 2025, of $114,068.

Market Shares\n\nRiot's strategy of maintaining 4% market share requires continuous capital deployment—$198 million in anticipated 2025 capex, including $110 million for miners.\n\n**Bitcoin Mining Market Position:**\n- The top 7 BTC mining operators are: MARA Holdings (previously MARA Holdings), Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, IREN (Iris Energy), CleanSpark, Phoenix Group and Bitdeer Technologies Group.\n- Riot Platforms (RIOT), formerly Riot Blockchain, is building its reputation through scale and sustainability. Its Whinstone and Corsicana sites in Texas already support a 33 EH/s hash rate and are set to reach 41 EH/s by the end of 2025.\n- Ranked among top 5-7 public Bitcoin miners globally by capacity\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- Bit Digital, Argo Blockchain, and DMG Blockchain Solutions are competitors of Riot Platforms.\n- Public miners with >10 EH/s capacity, such as Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, are now generating record monthly BTC production while maintaining lower breakeven costs thanks to next-gen ASIC efficiency.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- CleanSpark (CLSK) presents a different competitive threat with its renewable energy focus and 102% revenue growth in FY 2025. CLSK's sustainability credentials attract ESG investors and may command premium valuations, but its smaller scale limits bargaining power with ASIC suppliers. Riot's Texas grid reliance, while cost-effective, faces regulatory scrutiny that CLSK's green energy avoids. However, Riot's engineering moat enables hybrid mining-HPC setups that CLSK's mining-only model cannot replicate, providing a diversification path that reduces Bitcoin price dependency.\n\n**Competitive Weaknesses:**\n- Compared to MARA and CLSK, Riot is the least efficient, highest-cost miner, making the stock a high-risk Sell.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity:**\n\n1. **Block Mining Acquisition (2025)**\n   - 100% of the equity interests of Block Mining, a vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company based in Kentucky, for total consideration of approximately $ ... 7.2 million shares of Riot common stock valued at approximately $ 74.0 million, and a contingent purchase price payable to the sellers with an estimated fair value at acquisition of $ 26.1 million.\n\n2. **E4A Solutions Acquisition (2025)**\n   - The E4A Solutions Acquisition builds on Riot's vertically integrated strategy by adding engineering expertise to service its own existing and future electrical infrastructure and allows the Company to provide electrical solutions and services to support the rapidly growing market for electrical infrastructure.\n\n3. **Rhodium Asset Acquisition (2025)**\n   - The deal is valued at $185 million, comprising $129.9 million in cash, a $6.1 million return of Rhodium's power security deposit, and $49 million in Riot shares.\n\n4. **Land Acquisitions**\n   - Riot Platforms's most recent deal was a Corporate Asset Purchase with Riot Platforms (238 Acres Land Property in Corsicana, Texas).

It operates a closed-loop network, issuing proprietary credit, charge, and prepaid cards while also providing merchant acquiring services. Unlike open-loop networks like Visa and Mastercard, Amex controls both issuance and acceptance, enabling direct customer relationships, rich data insights, and premium rewards programs. The company serves affluent consumers (high-end cards like Platinum and Centurion), small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs via Business Platinum), and large corporates through expense management tools.\n\nAmex generates revenue primarily from discount revenue (fees from merchants, ~35-40% of total), net interest income (from cardmember lending, ~25-30%), and card fees (~15-20%). It emphasizes premium positioning: average cardmember spend exceeds peers, with strong loyalty via Membership Rewards. In 2023, it had 141.8 million card products worldwide, processing $1.6 trillion in payments volume. Geographically, U.S. Consumer Services (~45% revenue) and U.S. Commercial Services (~20%) dominate, followed by International Card Services (~25%) and Global Merchant & Network (~10%). Amex benefits from network effects but faces challenges in merchant acceptance outside premium segments. Its moat lies in brand prestige, superior customer service (e.g., concierge), and data-driven personalization. Recent focus includes digital wallet expansion (Apple Pay, Google Pay) and SMB growth amid economic resilience of its high-FICO customer base.

Founded in 2003 as BV Bank and rebranded under BayVanguard post-IPO, BVFL emphasizes commercial real estate (CRE) loans (62% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (25%), and consumer/residential mortgages. \n\nAs a community bank with total assets of $1.48 billion (Q2 2024), it differentiates via personalized service, local decision-making, and treasury management solutions.

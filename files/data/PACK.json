(PACK) is a global leader in sustainable, paper-based protective packaging solutions, primarily serving the e-commerce, industrial supply chain, and consumer goods sectors. Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Concord Township, Ohio, Ranpak designs, manufactures, and sells dispensers and paper-based consumables that replace plastic alternatives for void-fill, cushioning, and wrapping. Its products reduce packaging waste by up to 80% compared to foam or air pillows, aligning with global sustainability mandates (e.g., EU plastic bans). Operating in North America (~60% revenue), Europe (~35%), and Asia (~5%), Ranpak's automated machines like AutoBob and PadPak integrate into high-volume fulfillment centers. In Q2 2024, the company reported revenue of $96.1 million (+6% YoY), driven by e-commerce demand and machine placements (179 net new in H1 2024).

Headquartered in Stamford, CT, Synchrony operates as the largest issuer of private-label credit cards in the U.S., with over 100 million active accounts. Its core business revolves around co-branded and private-label credit cards (e.g., Amazon Store Card, CareCredit), buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) options, and installment loans, generating revenue mainly from interest income, interchange fees, and debt protection products. The company also offers banking products like savings accounts and CDs via its digital bank (Synchrony Bank), which holds ~$96 billion in deposits as of Q2 2024.\n\nSynchrony's strategy emphasizes technology-driven platforms for seamless consumer experiences, with key segments including Retail Card (~65% of loan receivables), CareCredit (medical financing), and Home & Auto. It serves everyday spending categories like retail, health, and digital commerce, partnering with marquee brands to capture high-frequency transactions. In 2023, it processed ~$200 billion in purchase volume. Recent growth has been fueled by deposit inflows, digital enhancements, and diversification beyond traditional retail cards amid e-commerce shifts. However, it faces cyclical consumer credit risks in a high-interest-rate environment. With a strong balance sheet (CET1 ratio 13.4% as of Q2 2024), Synchrony returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via buybacks/dividends in H1 2024, positioning it for resilient growth in a recovering consumer economy.

(NYSE: CTO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $18.62 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $397.3 million (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $16.02 - $20.93  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nCTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) is an internally managed real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on owning, operating, and selectively developing high-quality commercial real estate in the U.S. Sunbelt region, primarily Florida and Georgia. The company's portfolio consists of 20 grocery-anchored shopping centers (anchored by dominant grocers like Publix, ALDI, and Food Lion), multi-tenant retail centers, office properties, and mixed-use developments totaling approximately 3.6 million square feet across 13 states (as of Q2 2024). CTO emphasizes recession-resistant grocery-anchored retail, which drives over 70% of its rental income, with a focus on infill locations in affluent, high-growth markets. The REIT pursues value-add strategies through acquisitions, redevelopments, and ground-up developments, targeting 5-7% annual AFFO per share growth. With a conservative balance sheet (debt-to-EBITDA ~5.5x), investment-grade tenants (88% occupancy), and a dividend yield of ~7.7% ($0.38 quarterly), CTO appeals to income-focused investors. Recent portfolio reshaping includes dispositions of non-core assets to fund Sunbelt acquisitions, positioning it for demographic-driven demand in high-barrier-to-entry markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024):** Reported AFFO per share of $0.52 (vs. $0.55 prior year); net loss of $1.4M or ($0.07)/share due to one-time items.

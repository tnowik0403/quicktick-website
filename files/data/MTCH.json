(NASDAQ: MTCH) is the global leader in the online dating industry, operating a portfolio of over 40 dating brands that connect millions of users seeking romantic relationships. Its flagship app, Tinder, remains the world's highest-grossing non-gaming mobile app, generating the majority of revenue through freemium subscriptions, in-app purchases, and premium features like Super Likes and Boosts. Other key brands include Hinge (positioned as \"designed to be deleted\" for serious relationships), Match.com (traditional desktop/mobile site), Plenty of Fish (POF), Meetic (Europe-focused), OkCupid, Pairs (Asia), Azar and Hakuna (video chat/live streaming via Hyperconnect acquisition), Chispa (Latino-focused), The League (elite professionals), and BLK (Black community). The company serves ~100 million+ quarterly active users across 190+ countries, leveraging network effects, AI-driven matching algorithms, and data analytics for personalized experiences. Revenue is predominantly from direct sources (subscriptions ~85%, à la carte features ~15%), with indirect revenue from web traffic. MTCH benefits from high user stickiness (average Tinder user lifetime value ~$100-200) but faces monetization challenges from younger demographics preferring free social discovery. Headquartered in Dallas, TX, with ~2,700 employees, MTCH has evolved from IAC spin-off (2020) into a pure-play dating giant, emphasizing product innovation amid regulatory scrutiny.

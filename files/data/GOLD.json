Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Barrick operates 16 Tier 1 gold/copper mines across North and South America, Africa, and the Middle East, producing approximately 3.9-4.3 million ounces of gold and 420-470 million pounds of copper annually (2024 guidance). The company's portfolio emphasizes operational excellence, cost discipline, and value-accretive growth through organic expansions and exploration. Key assets include Nevada Gold Mines (61% JV with Newmont), Pueblo Viejo (60% Dominican Republic), Loulo-Gounkoto (80% Mali), and emerging copper projects like Lumwana (Zambia) and Reko Diq (Pakistan). Barrick's strategy centers on its \"Tier One\" framework, targeting free cash flow generation amid high gold prices (~$2,650/oz ATH as of Oct 2024) and copper demand from electrification. Recent Q2 2024 results (Aug 12, 2024) showed record free cash flow of $1.3 billion, with attributable gold production at 948koz at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $1,346/oz. Barrick divests non-core assets (e.g., Mali stake sale discussions) to fund copper growth, positioning it for dual-commodity leverage while navigating geopolitical risks.

Key brands include Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey (the world’s top-selling American whiskey), Woodford Reserve (leading super-premium bourbon), Old Forester (original small batch bourbon), Herradura and el Jimador tequilas, Finlandia vodka (prior to divestiture), Diplomático rum, and RTD innovations like Jack & Coke. Brown-Forman operates in over 170 countries, with ~55% of net sales from international markets (ex-US).

The bank operates ~42 branches primarily across Northern and Central California, including key markets like Sacramento, the Central Valley (e.g., Fresno, Bakersfield), and the North Coast (e.g., Santa Rosa). It serves retail, small-to-mid-sized businesses, agribusiness, professionals, and municipalities with core banking products emphasizing relationship-based lending and deposit gathering.\n\nTCBK's business model centers on conservative, high-credit-quality lending (non-performing loans <0.3% as of Q2 2024), with a loan portfolio dominated by commercial real estate (CRE ~50%), commercial & industrial (C&I ~20%), and agriculture (~15%). Deposits fund ~90% of assets, minimizing wholesale funding reliance. As a super-regional player, TCBK benefits from California's economic diversity (ag, tech, energy) but faces interest rate sensitivity. With $5.3B in total assets (Q2 2024), it prioritizes organic growth, capital returns (recent dividend hikes), and digital enhancements amid competition from larger nationals.

Growth Strategy\n\nAres Management is exploring potential acquisitions to expand its private equity business and better compete with industry leaders. CEO Michael Arougheti noted that ARES has adequate financial capacity to pursue both organic growth and acquisitions, particularly as U.S. retirement plans begin expanding access to private markets.\n\nA broader and more diversified private equity franchise will become increasingly important as defined contribution plans open up to alternative investments. Even a private equity firm managing $100 billion or more would be financially feasible for Ares Management.\n\nAres has been a vocal proponent of bringing private assets to the \"democratized\" wealth management channel. Through partnerships with firms like TIFIN AMP, Ares is making it easier for individual investors to access institutional-quality private credit and real estate funds.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Institutional Clients**: The firm serves a diverse investor base including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other large institutional investors globally.\n\n**Retail/Wealth Channel**: In 2024, Ares raised over $10 billion in equity commitments for semi-liquid wealth solutions, which was approximately 3x greater than 2023. This puts them at over $39 billion of AUM across eight semi-liquid products.\n\n**Corporate Clients**: Ares' U.S. corporate lending is primarily conducted through Ares Capital Corporation, providing asset-based and cash flow loans to small and middle market companies.\n\n**Recent Major Partnership**: Canada Pension Plan Investment Board made an equity commitment of approximately US$1.3 billion to Ares' Japan data center fund, joined by other large institutional investors including GLP Pte Ltd.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**: Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025, reached $1.66 billion, compared to $1.13 billion for the same period in 2024, representing a 47% increase. Management fees reached $971.8 million, representing a substantial 28% increase from the same period last year.\n\nAfter-tax realized income was $425.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n- Growing demand for alternative investments from institutional and retail investors\n- Reinforced leadership in fast-growing New Economy sectors—including logistics and data centers—which are benefiting from the acceleration of new digital technologies, global supply chain shifts and the evolution in how communities live and work\n- Expansion into wealth management channels providing access to retail investors\n- The AI boom showing no signs of slowing down, with the hyperscale data center pipeline expected to be a major driver of earnings\n- Recent S&P 500 inclusion providing increased institutional ownership and recognition\n\n**Headwinds**:\n- Intense competition from larger alternative asset managers like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR\n- Without M&A or IPOs, private equity has struggled to sell its deals. In the first quarter, the number of PE equity exits dropped 44% year over year to 323 transactions valued at $73.79 billion\n- Interest rate sensitivity affecting credit margins\n- Market watching closely to see if Ares can maintain its industry-leading margins while absorbing the overhead of a major new division\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAres demonstrates profound segment leadership, particularly in credit. Its Credit group is the world's largest manager of such assets, commanding an estimated 12% market share in the global direct lending space with over $290 billion in AUM.\n\nPrivate equity accounts for roughly $25 billion of ARES' assets under management as of Sept. 30, 2025, representing just more than 4% of total AUM, down from more than 13% at the time of the company's public listing in 2014.\n\nWith $456 billion in AUM, Ares Management Corporation is a definitive leader in the alternative asset management industry. This immense scale secures its position firmly within the top five firms globally.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors**: Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management, KKR & Co., The Carlyle Group, and TPG Inc.\n\nBlackstone stands as one of the largest alternative asset managers worldwide, with a significant presence in private equity, real estate, credit, and hedge fund investments. Similarly, KKR and Apollo maintain substantial operations in private equity, credit, and real estate, presenting direct challenges to Ares through their considerable scale and diversified investment portfolios.\n\n**Differentiation**: Ares Management's competitive advantages are deeply rooted in its expansive and integrated global platform, which covers Credit, Private Equity, Real Estate, and Infrastructure. This multi-asset class strategy allows for the provision of diverse capital solutions across a company's entire capital structure.\n\nApollo Global Management shares and Ares Management shares have shown large outperformance compared to Blackstone shares and KKR & Co. We would highlight the larger exposure to credit at both Apollo and Ares.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Major Acquisitions**:\n- In October 2024, Ares Management acquired the international business of GLP Capital Partners (GCP), excluding its Greater China business, for approximately $3.7 billion in cash and $1.9 billion in Ares Class A common stock\n- In December 2024, Ares acquired 10% of the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League. It was one of the first deals allowing outside investors to buy into an NFL franchise after league owners voted to allow new investors in August\n\n**Strategic Partnerships**:\n- Ares Australia Management is a strategic joint venture between Ares Management and Fidante Partners, part of Challenger Limited\n- CADC's investment adviser is a joint venture between affiliates of Ares and CION Investment Group, LLC and is controlled by Ares\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**December 2025**: Ares announced two significant data center transactions in the U.S. by Ares Real Assets funds, underscoring an expansion of Ares' global data center exposure\n\n**January 2026**: Ares Management Corporation raised approximately $7.1 billion for its Credit Secondaries strategy\n\n**S&P 500 Inclusion**: ARES stock has rebounded strongly throughout 2025, with shares trading in the $165–$185 range, supported by robust fee-related earnings (FRE) growth and the prestige of its new S&P 500 status\n\n**Future M&A Activity**: Investors should watch for announcements regarding a major private equity acquisition in the first half of 2026, as well as the firm's progress in scaling its retail distribution\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of Ares Management Corporation's strong fundamentals, market position, and growth prospects, I assign a **Buy Rating of 8.2/10**.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Strong revenue growth (47% Q3 2025) and expanding AUM ($596B)\n- Market leadership position in private credit (12% global market share)\n- Successful diversification strategy across multiple asset classes\n- Strong financial performance with 28% increase in management fees\n- Strategic positioning in high-growth areas (data centers, AI infrastructure)\n- Recent S&P 500 inclusion providing institutional recognition\n- Strong analyst consensus (9 buy ratings, 0 sells)\n\n**Fair Value Estimate**: **$185-$195 per share**\n\nThis represents approximately 9-15% upside from current levels (~$170), based on:\n- Average 12-month price target of $200.11 from analysts\n- Strong earnings growth trajectory with EPS estimates of $6.45 for 2026\n- Premium valuation justified by market-leading position and growth prospects\n- Conservative estimate accounting for potential market volatility and competitive pressures\n\nThe company demonstrates exceptional execution in alternative asset management with significant secular tailwinds from institutional and retail investor demand for alternative investments, making it well-positioned for continued growth despite competitive pressures.",

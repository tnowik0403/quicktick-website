(NYSE American: APT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $5.42\n- **Market Capitalization**: $132.6 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $3.55 - $7.65\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: ~45,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 11.2x\n- **EPS (TTM)**: $0.48\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAlpha Pro Tech, Ltd. (APT), founded in 1994 and headquartered in Markham, Ontario, Canada, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of disposable protective apparel and infection control products. The company specializes in single-use protective gear designed for high-risk environments, including cleanrooms, industrial safety, medical facilities, and construction sites. Its flagship products include shoe covers (e.g., PROTECHnology® line), disposable gowns, sleeves, aprons, bouffant caps, and face masks (e.g., NIOSH-certified N95 respirators). APT operates two manufacturing facilities in the U.S. (North Carolina and Utah) and sources raw materials globally, emphasizing quality certifications like ISO 9001 and FDA compliance.\n\nPost-COVID boom, where revenues peaked at $118.6M in 2021 driven by mask demand, APT has pivoted toward diversified industrial and cleanroom segments. In 2023, ~60% of sales came from disposable protective apparel (mainly shoe covers), 25% from building supply products (housewrap), and 15% from masks. The company distributes through wholesalers, distributors, and e-commerce, serving North American markets primarily (95%+ of revenue). With a lean balance sheet (no debt, $25M+ cash as of Q2 2024), APT focuses on operational efficiency and inventory management amid softening demand. Recent challenges include post-pandemic normalization, but strengths lie in brand loyalty for premium products and vertical integration.

DCF-based (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth) using Q2 2024 data; implies 13x 2025E EPS of $0.50. Strong growth portfolios may wait for industrial rebound confirmation.",

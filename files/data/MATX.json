(MATX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 25, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $144.09\n- **Market Capitalization**: $4.52 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $91.63 - $145.85\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 12.38\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.24% (quarterly dividend of $0.34/share declared Oct 3, 2024, payable Dec 5, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMatson, Inc. (MATX) is a leading U.S. ocean transportation and logistics company headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, specializing in Jones Act-compliant shipping services across the Pacific. Founded in 1882, Matson operates a fleet of 33 owned and chartered vessels, providing containerized freight and logistics solutions primarily to Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and other Pacific islands, with additional routes to China and Japan. The company dominates non-contiguous U.S. trade lanes protected by the Jones Act, which mandates U.S.-flagged vessels for domestic shipping. In fiscal 2023, Matson transported over 400,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), with Ocean Transportation (92% of revenue) focusing on scheduled liner services like the weekly China Long Beach Express (CLX) and intra-island routes, while Matson Logistics (8% of revenue) offers warehousing, distribution, and supply chain management. Recent expansions into expedited ocean services and terminal investments have bolstered its resilience amid volatile global freight rates. With a market cap of ~$4.5B, Matson benefits from geographic moats, fuel-efficient vessels, and long-term contracts, positioning it as a defensive play in the cyclical shipping sector.

With over 19 million monthly visitors and partnerships with 18,000+ dealers, Cars.com generates revenue primarily from dealer advertising subscriptions (e.g., listings, digital retailing tools), OEM (original equipment manufacturer) programs, and publishing/advertising.

In a fragmented $1.2 trillion U.S. auto retail market, Cars.com holds a strong position by emphasizing scalable SaaS-like tools for dealers amid a shift from traditional lots to omnichannel experiences.

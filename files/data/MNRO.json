(MNRO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Date of Report:** November 15, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $22.95 (as of market close November 15, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $708.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, November 15, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $21.69 - $36.10  \n**Sources:** Real-time search via Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.monro.com), Earnings transcripts (Q1 FY25: Aug 15, 2024; Q2 FY25: Oct 24, 2024), Motley Fool, Barron's, Reddit/WallStreetBets discussions, Twitter/X sentiment (low volume, neutral-bearish), Zacks, TipRanks analyst consensus.\n\n## Company Overview (212 words)\nMonro, Inc. (MNRO) is a leading U.S. automotive service provider specializing in undercar repair and tire services. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Rochester, NY, the company operates approximately 1,263 locations across 32 states under brands including Monro Auto Service and Tire Centers, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tire Choice Auto Service Centers, Car-X, and Mountain View Tire & Auto Service (as of Q2 FY25 ended September 28, 2024). Services focus on brakes, alignments, exhaust systems, shocks/struts, oil changes, tires, and routine maintenance, targeting retail customers with an average ticket of ~$250. Monro emphasizes a \"one-stop\" model for light mechanical repairs, avoiding heavy engine/transmission work to maintain quick turnaround. In FY24 (ended March 30, 2024), it generated $1.45 billion in revenue, with ~55% from tires/brakes and ~45% from maintenance/services. The company serves a fragmented market dominated by independents (~70% share), big-box retailers, and OEM dealers. Monro's competitive edge lies in its scale, regional density (e.g., Northeast dominance), and vertical integration via in-house tire distribution. Recent challenges include macroeconomic pressures slowing discretionary spending, but tailwinds from an aging U.S. vehicle fleet (average age 12.6 years per IHS Markit) support long-term demand. Store optimization and digital enhancements are key growth levers.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY25 Earnings (Oct 24, 2024):** Revenue $342.4 million (down 5.5% YoY); comparable store sales down 4.5%; gross margin 36.4% (up 110 bps YoY from 35.3%); net loss $2.7 million or ($0.09) EPS (vs. $0.16 profit YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $27.2 million (down 22%).

(NASDAQ: CHTR), operating as Spectrum, is the second-largest cable operator in the U.S., serving over 32 million customers across 41 states through a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network covering 57% of U.S. homes. The company delivers high-speed broadband (primary revenue driver at ~65% of total), video services, voice, and mobile wireless under the Spectrum brand. Evolving from a legacy cable TV provider, Charter has pivoted to connectivity-focused offerings, with Spectrum Internet providing speeds up to 1 Gbps via DOCSIS 3.1 upgrades (completed ~94% of footprint by mid-2025). Spectrum Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) on Verizon's network, has surpassed 9.9 million lines as of Q3 2025, contributing high-margin growth. Business services target SMBs and enterprises with fiber-enabled broadband, Ethernet, and managed services. Charter invests ~$2.5-2.8 billion annually in network capex for DOCSIS 4.0 readiness and targeted fiber overbuilds, positioning for 10 Gbps symmetric speeds. Amid cord-cutting (video subs down to ~12.7 million), broadband ARPU growth via pricing and speed tiers sustains ~5-6% revenue expansion. Headquartered in Stamford, CT, Charter's scale enables aggressive buybacks ($10B authorized in 2025) despite $97B net debt.

Mobile share: 4% of U.S. postpaid (up from 3% in 2024, per Strategy Analytics Q4 2025).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (Q3 2025) | CHTR | CMCSA (Comcast) | VZ (Verizon) | TMUS (T-Mobile) |\n|------------------|------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Broadband Subs (M)** | 32.3 | 32.8 | 9.5 (Fios/5G) | 6.2 (5G Home) |\n| **Market Share %** | 31% | 32% | 11% (fiber) | 6% |\n| **Mobile Lines (M)** | 9.9 | 25.3 (Xfinity) | 143 (core) | 119 |\n| **Rev Growth YoY** | 0% | +1% | +2% | +6% |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 37% | 39% | 40% | 35% |\n| **Key Edge** | Mobile growth, HFC scale | Peacock integration | Fiber/5G depth | Price disruption |\n\nCharter trails Comcast in scale but leads mobile momentum; fiber peers encroach on premium tiers.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Verizon (MVNO since 2018, renewed 2024 for 10G support); Disney/YouTube for TV apps; AWS for cloud/AI (expanded Jul 2025).\n- **M&A**: No major deals since 2016 TWC acquisition; $1.2B spectrum auction buy (600 MHz, Jun 2025); divested small assets ($500M, Q2 2025).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Residential (90% revenue); SMB/enterprise (e.g., healthcare chains, retailers via Spectrum Enterprise).\n- **Potential**: BEAD-funded rural expansions; hyperscalers for edge computing (rumored Google talks, Nov 2025).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: B- rating (S&P); carbon-neutral network goal 2030; diversity initiatives (40% women in mgmt).\n- **Management**: CEO Chris Winfrey (since 2022) focused on deleveraging; strong insider ownership (1.2%).\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (broadband affordability rules); execution on fiber (capex overrun risk).\n- **Opportunities**: AI data center demand; potential spin-off of enterprise unit (speculation post-Q3 call).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold) – Solid broadband/mobile growth offsets debt/regulatory pressures; limited upside vs. fiber pure-plays but undervalued on FCF yield (8%). Moderate risk portfolio: Defensive growth with 10-15% annual returns via buybacks.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $440 (16% upside) – DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, FY2026 EBITDA $20.5B); peers at 8x EV/EBITDA.

The transformative Cox merger offers substantial synergies and market positioning benefits, while the company's mobile growth trajectory remains strong. However, ongoing broadband subscriber losses, cybersecurity challenges including the Salt Typhoon breach, and intense competition from wireless carriers create meaningful risks. The stock trades at attractive multiples relative to fundamentals, but execution of the merger and competitive positioning will be critical.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $275-$285**\n\nThis valuation reflects a premium to current trading levels but below analyst targets, accounting for merger synergies while recognizing competitive and operational challenges. The estimate assumes successful completion of the Cox transaction and stabilization of broadband trends, but incorporates risks from wireless competition and cybersecurity concerns.",

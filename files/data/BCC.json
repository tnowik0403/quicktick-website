Founded in 2004 via a Boise Cascade Corporation spin-off and subsequent merger with OfficeMax, the company has evolved into a fully integrated player in the construction supply chain. \n\nThe Wood Products segment manufactures engineered wood products (EWP) like LVL beams, I-joists, and plywood panels, as well as softwood dimensional lumber, primarily from southern yellow pine and Douglas fir sourced from sustainably managed forests. This segment generated ~23% of 2023 revenues. The BMD segment, the larger contributor at ~77% of revenues, operates a network of 37 distribution centers across 16 states, serving professional builders, remodelers, and commercial contractors with a broad portfolio including EWP, lumber, siding, decking, insulation, and specialty building materials. \n\nBoise Cascade benefits from vertical integration, allowing Wood Products to supply ~30-40% of BMD's EWP needs internally, enhancing margins during lumber cycles. With ~6,000 employees, the company reported 2023 revenues of $6.8 billion, focusing on the repair/remodel (R&R) market (60% of BMD sales) which is less cyclical than new residential construction. Headquartered in Boise, Idaho, BCC emphasizes operational efficiency, inventory management, and strategic acquisitions to drive market share in a fragmented distribution industry.

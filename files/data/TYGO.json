Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nTigo Energy, Inc. (TYGO) is a global leader in intelligent solar module-level power electronics (MLPE) and software solutions for the photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage markets. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Campbell, California, the company designs, manufactures, and sells hardware and software that enhance solar PV system safety, performance, monitoring, and optimization. Its core offerings include TS optimizers for rapid shutdown and power optimization at the module level, compatible with residential, commercial, industrial, and utility-scale installations. Tigo's Tigo Cloud platform provides real-time monitoring, fleet management, and AI-driven analytics for asset owners and installers. The company serves over 3 million module sites across 100+ countries, focusing on high-growth markets like the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. Tigo differentiates through its \"flexible platform architecture,\" allowing retrofits and compatibility with diverse inverters and panels. Post its July 2023 public debut via SPAC merger with FirstSun Capital Bancorp, TYGO has emphasized U.S. expansion amid Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tailwinds, while navigating solar sector cyclicality. With a lean fabless model outsourcing manufacturing to Asia, Tigo reported Q2 2024 revenue of $12.6 million (up 30% YoY), GAAP gross margin of 39.1%, though it posted a net loss of $12.5 million due to operating expenses and stock-based comp.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $12.6M (+30% YoY), gross margin 39.1%; Q3 guidance $17-19M revenue (+35-55% YoY est.).

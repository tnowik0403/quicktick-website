Headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, PKG operates through three main segments: Packaging (corrugated products and services), Paper (uncoated freesheet and paperboard), and Corporate/Other. The company manufactures containerboard at five mills with an annual capacity of approximately 4.9 million tons, converting it into ~15 billion corrugated shipping containers annually at 75+ plants. PKG also produces market pulp and specialty paperboard. With a focus on sustainability, it uses 100% recycled fiber in many products and emphasizes mill efficiency upgrades. Founded in 1867, PKG has grown via organic investments and strategic acquisitions, positioning itself as a low-cost leader in a fragmented $50B+ U.S. corrugated box market. In 2023, it generated $7.77B in revenue, benefiting from resilient demand amid e-commerce growth, though cyclicality ties it to industrial and consumer packaging volumes.

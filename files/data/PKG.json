Growth Strategy\n\nThis acquisition furthers PCA's profitable growth strategy.

Executives pointed to complementary assets in areas like Texas that will enable growth with a lower level of capital spending. \"We'd already been looking at what we would be doing down in the Dallas region, which would have entailed, more than likely, building out a new, very large plant down there,\" Kowlzan said. \"Yet, with the acquisition, with Greif, we've got the platform already sitting there that we can build out with just some converting equipment.\"\n\n## 6.

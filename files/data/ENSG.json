  "tldr_summary": "The Ensign Group operates the largest skilled nursing facility network in the U.S., managing 373 healthcare operations across 17 states with ancillary services including dialysis, respiratory care, and home health.\n\nThe company is executing an aggressive acquisition strategy, adding 52 facilities since 2024 through both organic growth and major deals like the Sabra Health Care REIT portfolio. ENSG benefits from powerful demographic tailwinds—an aging population driving sustained demand for post-acute care services projected to grow at 4.39% CAGR through 2033. Financial performance is strong with 42.3% year-over-year net income growth and 2025 EPS guidance raised to $6.34-$6.46. However, material risks include critical healthcare workforce shortages and dependency on Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\nThe stock warrants a Strong Buy rating at current levels, with fair value of $205-$210 representing modest 17-20% upside from $175.46, supported by market leadership, execution track record, and favorable secular trends offsetting regulatory risks."

Its decentralized \"operating subsidiary\" model empowers local management with autonomy, fostering agility and high occupancy rates (typically 85-90%). Ensign owns or leases real estate through its Standard Bearer Portfolio (over 100 properties), reducing reliance on third-party landlords and enabling favorable lease terms. The company reported $3.73 billion in trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue as of Q2 2024, driven by organic growth in patient volumes, ancillary services, and tuck-in acquisitions. Ensign emphasizes high-quality care, evidenced by strong CMS star ratings (average 4.2/5 for SNFs), and invests in rehab therapy and home-based care to capture aging population demand. With a disciplined capital allocation strategy—balancing M&A, real estate investments, and share repurchases—Ensign has delivered 15-20% annual revenue CAGR over five years, positioning it as a resilient leader in the fragmented $120B+ U.S. post-acute care market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 1, 2024, via Ensign IR and SEC filings)**: Revenue $997.2M (+10.4% YoY), net income $69.4M, diluted EPS $1.17 (+11.8% YoY), adjusted EBITDA $170.2M (+12.1% YoY).

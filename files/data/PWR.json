(PWR) is a Fortune 500 company and the largest specialized contracting firm in North America, delivering comprehensive infrastructure solutions across critical sectors including electric power transmission and distribution, renewable energy, underground utilities, pipelines, industrial facilities, and communications networks. Founded in 1997 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, Quanta operates through three main segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (EPIS, ~68% of revenue), Underground and Infrastructure Solutions (UIS, ~17%), and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions (REIS, ~15%). The company serves over 1,000 customers, including utilities, independent power producers, hyperscale data center operators, and telecom providers, executing large-scale, complex projects that support grid modernization, energy transition, and digital infrastructure buildout.\n\nQuanta's competitive edge lies in its national scale (operating in all 50 U.S. states and Canada), ~55,000 workforce, record backlog exceeding $30 billion, and expertise in high-voltage transmission, substations, solar/wind/battery storage, horizontal directional drilling, and fiber optic deployments. With the U.S. investing trillions in infrastructure via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Quanta is positioned at the forefront of electrification, renewables (targeting 50 GW+ solar/wind pipeline), and AI-driven data center power demands. In Q2 2024, it reported record revenues of $5.324 billion (up 17.5% YoY), driven by EPIS and REIS growth amid tightening power grids and storm restoration.

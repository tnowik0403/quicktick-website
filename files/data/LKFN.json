Founded in 1872, the company provides a full range of commercial, retail, wealth management, and investment services to businesses, professionals, and the general public in northern Indiana. Lake City Bank operates 24 full-service branches across 16 counties, with a strong emphasis on commercial lending (particularly to the recreational vehicle/RV, manufactured housing, and agriculture sectors), small business banking, and deposit gathering. As of Q3 2024, LKFN manages approximately $3.1 billion in loans and $4.1 billion in deposits, positioning it as a leading community bank in its niche markets. The bank's strategy revolves around relationship-based banking, prudent risk management, and organic growth, supported by a conservative balance sheet with low non-performing assets (0.25% as of Q3). LKFN differentiates itself through specialized industry expertise (e.g., RV manufacturing hub in Elkhart County) and a dividend aristocrat status, having increased payouts for 13 consecutive years. Recent performance reflects resilience amid high interest rates, with net interest margin (NIM) stabilizing at 4.03% in Q3 2024.

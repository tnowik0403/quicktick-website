Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

All current analysis uses FN data from verified sources (Yahoo Finance, company filings, Seeking Alpha transcripts as of October 11, 2024). No active trading under FBLA exists.\n\n## Company Overview\nFabrinet (NYSE: FN) is a leading provider of advanced optical, electro-mechanical, and electronic manufacturing services (EMS) to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in high-growth, mission-critical sectors. Headquartered in George Town, Cayman Islands, with primary manufacturing in Thailand, the U.S., and China, Fabrinet specializes in precision optics packaging, precision optics manufacturing, optical, electro-mechanical, and electronic manufacturing, coating, and advanced assembly. Its end-markets include data centers (AI-driven optics), telecommunications (800G/1.6T transceivers), automotive/EV (LiDAR/sensors), industrial lasers, and aerospace/defense.\n\nThe company operates ~15 facilities globally, emphasizing high-mix, low-to-medium volume production for complex components like silicon photonics-based transceivers critical for AI infrastructure. Fabrinet does not design products but excels in turnkey manufacturing, supply chain management, and rapid prototyping/scaling. In FY2024 (ended June 28, 2024), it served ~30 key customers, with revenue diversified: ~50% optics, ~30% electro-mechanical/electronics, rest coating/advanced assembly. Its competitive edge lies in vertical integration, Thailand's cost-effective/low-risk footprint (post-US-China tensions), and expertise in co-packaged optics (CPO) for hyperscale data centers. Fabrinet has grown from a niche optics player to an AI enabler, capitalizing on explosive demand for high-speed optical connectivity amid the generative AI boom.

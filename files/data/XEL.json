(XEL) is one of the largest U.S. investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities, serving approximately 3.8 million electric customers and 2.2 million natural gas customers across eight states: Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico. Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, the company operates through three main segments: Electric Utility, Natural Gas Utility, and Regulated Investments. XEL is a leader in the clean energy transition, with over 50% of its electricity generated from carbon-free sources as of 2025, including significant wind (18 GW capacity), solar, nuclear, and hydro assets. The company invests heavily in grid modernization, renewable expansion, and electrification initiatives like EV charging infrastructure and data centers. In 2025, XEL advanced its \"Steel for People\" clean energy plan, targeting 80-85% carbon-free electricity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, supported by $34 billion in capital investments from 2025-2029. Recent challenges include regulatory scrutiny from the 2024 Marshall Fire and 2021 Texas winter storm, but strong rate case approvals and federal incentives (e.g., IRA tax credits) bolster growth. XEL's regulated model ensures stable cash flows, with a focus on EPS growth of 5-7% annually through 2030.

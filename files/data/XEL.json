Existing Products/Services\n\nXcel Energy operates through three segments: regulated electric utility, regulated natural gas utility, and all others. The company's operations include generation of electricity using coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, solar, and other renewable sources; purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity; and production, purchase, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas.\n\nXcel Energy also provides home appliance repair, maintenance, and replacement services, and is actively involved in energy-related activities such as energy conservation, coal and transportation services, and the development of renewable energy sources. In 2024, Xcel Energy provided $187 million in customer rebates and incentives through programs enabling customers to embrace energy-efficient lighting, appliances and more, with customers installing more than 23,000 solar systems through the company's Solar*Rewards program.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe utility is planning 7.5 GW of renewable generation, 3 GW of gas generation, 1.9 GW of energy storage, 1,500 miles of high-voltage transmission and $5 billion for wildfire mitigation as part of a $60 billion capital spending plan. The plan is expected to deliver 7,500 megawatts of zero-carbon renewable generation, 3,000 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation, and almost 2,000 megawatts of energy storage to ensure system reliability.\n\nIn Texas and New Mexico, Xcel Energy announced in July 2025 a substantial expansion, adding 5,168 MW of new capacity by 2030, including 3,200 MW of dispatchable generation and energy storage, alongside 1,968 MW of wind and solar projects. By 2030, Xcel Energy plans to add 3,300 MW of new wind, 1,550 MW of new solar, and 1,230 MW of new battery storage in the Upper Midwest.\n\nA partnership with Form Energy will introduce an iron-air battery storage system in 2025, aiming to improve grid reliability. The company is exploring hydrogen development, having secured a federal grant for a Midwest regional hydrogen network in late 2023. Xcel Energy plans to launch its first virtual power plant program by 2030 as part of its Minnesota resource plan.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nXcel Energy has detailed an ambitious $45 billion capital expenditure plan for the 2025-2029 period, an increase of $11 billion from its prior five-year plan. The company is actively pursuing ambitious expansion initiatives, primarily focused on its clean energy transition and grid modernization. A substantial 63% of the planned $45 billion capital investment from 2025 to 2029 is dedicated to transmission and distribution upgrades, with 11% allocated to renewables and 10% to new generation projects.\n\nA major growth driver in 2025 is the demand from large-scale data centers, with a contracted pipeline of 3 GW and a potential queue exceeding 20 GW. New data center load represents about 60% of Xcel's anticipated retail sales growth through 2030. Developers have proposed nearly 9,000 megawatts of new data center capacity across Xcel Energy's eight-state territory, or almost 9 million homes' worth of electricity consumption, with data centers alone accounting for about half of Xcel's expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company experienced a \"material shift\" in electrical demand during the second quarter as the company lined up new data center prospects, including already-announced deals with Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS Realty Trust in Colorado. As a national leader in the clean energy transition, Xcel Energy is proud to work with Meta to power Meta's new data center in Rosemount, Minnesota. The Meta data center will represent an investment of more than $800 million in the local economy and will support approximately 1,000 jobs during construction as well as 100 jobs once completed.\n\nCEO Bob Frenzel noted they are \"trying to find long-term pricing arrangements with the Metas, the Googles, the Amazons of the world,\" including \"15-20 year contracts\" with \"minimum revenue requirements, or minimum floor takes, in terms of contract pricing.\" In February 2025, Microsoft bought close to 300 acres of land from Xcel in Becker, Minnesota.\n\n## 7.

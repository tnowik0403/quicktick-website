(NPK) is a diversified manufacturer headquartered in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, operating primarily in two segments: Housewares/Small Appliance (60-70% of revenue historically) and Defense (30-40%). The Housewares segment designs, manufactures, and sells a wide range of consumer kitchen appliances under the iconic Presto® brand, including electric pressure cookers, air fryers, slow cookers, griddles, deep fryers, and innovative products like the Pizza Pizzazz rotating pizza oven. These are distributed through major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Costco, targeting value-conscious consumers. The Defense segment focuses on munitions components, producing 40mm ammunition, precision detonators, percussion primers, booster detonators, and lead-free explosive charges for military applications. This segment supplies the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and allies amid rising global demand. NPK emphasizes in-house manufacturing, quality control, and operational efficiency, with ~1,200 employees across Wisconsin facilities. Post-2021 divestiture of its absorbent products business (sold for $135M), NPK streamlined to core competencies. FY2023 revenue was ~$336M, with Defense offsetting Housewares softness.

Existing Products/Services\n\nCintas operates through several key segments:\n\n• **Uniform Rental and Facility Services**: The company rents and services uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels, and other ancillary items; and provides restroom cleaning services and supplies, as well as sells uniforms. Uniform is still the main backbone of the business, contributing 38% of revenue.\n\n• **First Aid and Safety Services**: In addition, the company offers first aid and safety services, and fire protection products and services. Increasing demand for AED Rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak products is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment's performance.\n\n• **Fire Protection**: With offerings including uniforms, mats, mops, towels, restroom supplies, workplace water services, first aid and safety products, eye-wash stations, safety training, fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems and alarm service, Cintas helps customers get Ready for the Workday®.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThese results reflect the disciplined execution of our strategy, the benefits of our on-going technology investments and the exceptional commitment of our employee-partners to serving our customers.\n\n• **Technology Investments**: The SmartTruck system is a microcosm of Cintas's operational ingenuity. By optimizing delivery routes using real-time traffic data and AI-driven scheduling, the platform has cut annual mileage by 12% and emissions by 15%, while increasing customer-facing time by 8%.\n\n• **Digital Platform Expansion**: The myCintas portal is the company's most underappreciated asset. By offering 24/7 access to ordering, billing, and delivery tracking, Cintas has reduced customer service calls by 22% and increased account retention to 98%.\n\n• **AI and Automation**: The company's strategic investments in AI and automation, coupled with its capital allocation strategy, suggest a proactive approach to navigate these challenges and capitalize on future opportunities.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nCintas's growth strategy involves a combination of organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Paris Uniform Services in March 2024 enhanced Cintas' presence in key regions such as Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n• **Vertical Market Focus**: Cintas plans to accelerate growth by deepening penetration in healthcare, hospitality, education, and government verticals, while further cross-selling first aid, fire protection, and hygiene services to its existing customer base. The company's targeted focus on key verticals such as healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government continues to pay off. These verticals now represent roughly 11% of revenue and are growing faster than the company's aggregate rate.\n\n• **No-Programmer Market**: Volume growth in uniform & linen rentals can arise from existing customers, new customers due to competitive wins and new customers due to penetration of the no-programmer market, which refers to customers that use or could use uniforms or linens but that don't participate in a rental program currently.\n\n• **Technology and Efficiency**: The company will continue investing in technology—such as supply chain automation, digital tools, and early-stage AI—to improve productivity and customer experience.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCintas services over 1M enterprise and SMB customers via 11k local routes in over 330 cities. Most industry verticals are represented in the company's list of customers, but the highest concentration is in manufacturing, auto, healthcare, food services and education. It has a diversified customer base of over 1 million large corporations and small and midsize businesses across North America, with no single customer making up more than 1% of total revenue.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q2 FY2026 Financial Results (December 18, 2025)**:\n• Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 was $2.80 billion compared to $2.56 billion in last year's second quarter, an increase of 9.3%.\n• The organic revenue growth rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.6%.\n• Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 23.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to 23.1% in last year's second quarter. Net income was $495.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $448.5 million in last year's second quarter, an increase of 10.4%.\n• Second quarter of fiscal 2026 diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.21 compared to $1.09 in last year's second quarter, an increase of 11.0%.\n\n**Full Year Guidance (Updated)**: Cintas raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $11.15 billion to $11.22 billion, up from a prior range of $11.06 billion to $11.18 billion. The company also raised its diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.81 to $4.88, compared to the previous range of $4.74 to $4.86.\n\n**Capital Returns**: During the first six months of fiscal 2026, Cintas has returned $1.24 billion in capital to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n• Strength in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, driven by strong growth from new customers and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, is aiding the segment. Increasing demand for AED Rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak products is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment's performance.\n• Cintas' moat lies in its scale and customer stickiness. With a 50%+ share of the $15 billion U.S. uniform rental market, it benefits from high switching costs for clients, which rely on its logistics and service networks. Its recurring revenue model—85% of sales come from subscription-based services—offers predictability, a key advantage in volatile economic environments.\n• At last count, Cintas claimed a leading 31% slice of the North American uniform rental market, a $25.9 billion pie expected to grow to $42.5 billion by 2035. The firm serves over one million customer sites, keeping its competitive edge sharp with a vertically integrated supply chain, national distribution reach, and the kind of tracking tech that keeps logistics humming.\n\n**Headwinds**:\n• However, Cintas has been dealing with the adverse impacts of high costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, its cost of sales (comprising costs related to uniform rental and facility services and others) increased 6.9% year over year to $1.34 billion due to higher material and labor costs. Also, selling and administrative expenses climbed 9.1% to $728.5 million in the same period due to an increase in employee-partner related expenses. Escalating costs and expenses, if left unchecked, may negatively impact profitability in the quarters ahead.\n• Economic Sensitivity: If the broader economy nosedives, or if manufacturing and hospitality companies cut back, demand for uniforms and facility services could stumble—chipping away at Cintas's growth and the number of uniforms needed on-site.\n• CTAS has considerable exposure to regions outside the United States. Its significant international presence exposes it to political and economic disruptions, all of which can directly affect its profits. Also, the company is exposed to headwinds arising from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIt enjoys a roughly 31% market share. According to estimates, Market share of Cintas Corporation: 30% (estimated, 2025) Main competitors and their market shares: Cintas Corporation: 30% Aramark: 25% UniFirst Corporation: 15% Alsco: 10% G&K Services: 8% Mission Linen Supply: 5% Other smaller providers: 7%\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors**:\n• **UniFirst (UNF)**: Although smaller than Cintas, UniFirst has been growing steadily. In fiscal 2024 (year ended Aug. 31, 2024), UniFirst reported $2.427 billion in revenue, up 8.7% from the prior year. The company achieved this while boosting operating income by 37% and net income by 40%.\n\n• **Elis**: Financially, Elis is roughly comparable in size to Cintas. In fiscal 2024, Elis delivered record revenue of €4.57 billion, a 6.1% increase over 2023. This growth was driven by strong pricing (to offset wage inflation) and robust organic demand (5.2% organic growth).\n\n• **Aramark**: Listed as a major competitor with approximately 25% market share in the uniform rental industry.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**: The firm's financial strength is complemented by strategic growth initiatives – including technology investments (like advanced inventory tracking) and acquisitions (notably the 2017 acquisition of G&K Services, which brought in roughly $2.2 billion in revenue and pushed combined annual sales past $6 billion).\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity**:\n• The company acquired Paris Uniform Services, a family-owned supplier of uniform and facility service solutions, in March 2024. The buyout enhanced Cintas' presence in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and West Virginia. In February 2024, the company acquired SITEX, which strengthened its market position in the central Midwest region of the United States.\n\n• It is worth noting that Cintas acquired businesses for $232.9 million in fiscal 2025 (ended June 2025).\n\n**Historical Major Acquisitions**:\n• Historically, G&K Services was a major uniform rental competitor until Cintas acquired it in 2017.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**UniFirst Acquisition Proposal (December 2025)**:\nCintas Corporation (Nasdaq: CTAS) today announced that it submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of UniFirst Corporation (NYSE: UNF) to acquire all outstanding common and class B shares of UniFirst for $275.00 per share (the \"Proposal\") in cash. The Proposal, which was delivered to the UniFirst Board on December 12, 2025, implies a total value for UniFirst of approximately $5.2 billion and offers UniFirst shareholders a 64% premium to UniFirst's ninety-day average closing price as of December 11, 2025.\n\nCintas, a big maker of workplace products, has submitted another offer to acquire smaller uniform supplier UniFirst, showing no signs of giving up after nearly four years of failing to get a deal done. Cincinnati-based Cintas makes products including uniforms, mops, restroom supplies, first-aid items and other safety products. It has a market value of about $75 billion and has been trying for years to acquire UniFirst, which is based in Wilmington, Mass., and provides uniforms and protective clothing to businesses across industries.\n\n**Q2 FY2026 Earnings (December 18, 2025)**:\nTodd M. Schneider, Cintas' President and Chief Executive Officer, stated \"We delivered another strong quarter, with record revenue driven by attractive growth across all our business segments, an all-time high operating margin and robust cash generation. These results reflect the disciplined execution of our strategy, the benefits of our on-going technology investments and the exceptional commitment of our employee-partners to serving our customers.\"\n\n## 13.

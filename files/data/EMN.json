Founded in 1920 as a Tennessee Eastman subsidiary of Eastman Kodak, it became independent in 1994 and focuses on innovative, sustainable chemical solutions rather than commodity chemicals. EMN operates through four segments: Additives & Functional Products (35% of sales; coatings, inks, tires); Agility (30%; adhesives, non-wovens); Chemical Intermediates (20%; PET precursors); and Fiber Solutions (15%; cellulose acetate for filters, yarns). The company emphasizes \"molecular recycling\" and circular economy initiatives, converting plastic waste into high-quality materials for consumer goods, packaging, and industrial applications. In 2023, EMN generated $9.2 billion in revenue, with ~50% from North America. Its strategy pivots from cyclical petrochemicals toward higher-margin specialties (targeting 50%+ of sales by 2025), leveraging innovation in sustainable plastics amid regulatory pressures like EU plastic taxes. Recent challenges include volatile raw material costs, but tailwinds from EV battery materials and hygiene products support resilience. EMN's 2024 guidance reaffirms adjusted EPS of $7.10-$7.65, prioritizing cash flow ($950M-$1.05B free cash flow expected) for dividends (yield ~3.5%) and buybacks ($300M authorized in 2024).

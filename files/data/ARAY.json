Daily Volume**: 1.02 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (negative earnings)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $239.5 million\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAccuray Incorporated is a global leader in precision radiation oncology, designing, manufacturing, and selling innovative radiosurgery and radiotherapy systems used to treat tumors and lesions throughout the body without invasive surgery. Founded in 1992 and headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, the company pioneered robotic radiosurgery with its flagship CyberKnife® System, which delivers targeted radiation using real-time image guidance and robotic mobility for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Its portfolio also includes the TomoTherapy® platform for image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) and supporting software like Precision® Treatment Planning and iDARC™ for adaptive therapy.\n\nAccuray serves over 800 installed systems worldwide, focusing on complex cancers (e.g., lung, prostate, brain, liver) with superior accuracy, reduced treatment times, and fewer side effects compared to traditional methods. Revenue is derived ~75% from product sales/leases/upgrades (systems) and ~25% from services (maintenance, support). The company targets high-growth markets like China (via JV partner Yukong) and emerging economies, navigating a ~$7B global external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) market growing at 5-7% CAGR through 2030, driven by aging populations, cancer incidence (18M new cases/year globally), and demand for non-invasive treatments. Challenges include competition from giants like Varian and supply chain issues, but Accuray's niche in SRS/SBRT (20-30% market sub-segment) positions it for expansion amid reimbursement tailwinds. FY2024 revenue hit $456.8M (verified Q4 FY24 earnings, Aug 29, 2024), with installed base growth offsetting pricing pressures.

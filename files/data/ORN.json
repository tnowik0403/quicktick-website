(NYSE: ORN) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $8.23 (closing price as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $278.5 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.53 - $10.12  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 512,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nOrion Group Holdings, Inc. (ORN) is a leading marine infrastructure construction firm specializing in heavy civil marine projects across the U.S. Gulf Coast, Northeast, West Coast, Southeast, and internationally (e.g., Mexico, Caribbean). Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Houston, TX, the company operates through two segments: Marine (80%+ of revenue) and Concrete (bridge to marine ops). The Marine segment delivers dredging, marine transportation/infrastructure, specialty services like fabrication, revetments, and beach renourishment for federal/state agencies, ports, and private clients. The Concrete segment provides ready-mix concrete, concrete ground slabs, and precast for industrial/marine projects. ORN's backlog stood at $901 million as of Q2 2024 (up 20% YoY), driven by U.S. infrastructure spending via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA/IIJA funding ~$550B). With a fleet of 25+ vessels (dredges, barges, tugs), ORN benefits from dredging market demand amid port deepening, coastal resilience, and navigation channel maintenance. Recent debt refinancing (May 2024) strengthened its balance sheet, positioning ORN for growth in a fragmented, capital-intensive sector amid rising federal appropriations.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings released.

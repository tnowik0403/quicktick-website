All quantitative financials sourced from Q3 2024 10-Q/earnings release (<6 months old).*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nHumana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) is one of the largest U.S. health insurers, with a primary focus on government-sponsored programs, particularly Medicare Advantage (MA), where it serves over 5.5 million members. Founded in 1961 and headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana operates through a diversified portfolio including Medicare Advantage (its core segment, ~80% of revenue), Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, Medicaid managed care, and commercial/group insurance. The company emphasizes value-based care via its CenterWell brand, which integrates primary care clinics, home health, and pharmacy services to manage costs and improve outcomes for seniors.\n\nIn 2023, Humana insured ~17 million total members, with MA enrollment growing 8% YoY to ~5.3 million despite industry pressures. Revenue is driven by per-member-per-month premiums, bolstered by risk-adjustment payments under CMS models. Humana differentiates through its dense provider networks in the Southeast and Midwest, leveraging data analytics and AI for utilization management. However, it faces sector headwinds like elevated medical loss ratios (MLR) from pent-up elective procedures post-COVID and regulatory scrutiny on MA coding practices. With ~90,000 employees, Humana is shifting toward integrated care delivery, acquiring primary care assets to counter fee-for-service inefficiencies.

Moderate risk appetite suits wait-for-dip entry; growth upside hinges on 2026 stars recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $380** (19% upside; DCF-based on 8% revenue CAGR 2025-2028, 12x 2026 EPS $32, per JPM/Barclays models adjusted for Q3). Strong growth portfolio: Accumulate below $300 on cost-cut execution.",

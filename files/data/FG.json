(FG) is a leading provider of retirement savings and protection solutions in the U.S., focusing on fixed annuities and life insurance products. Headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, and founded in 1959 (public since September 2021 via spinoff from parent FNF Group), FG targets the growing demand for guaranteed income in retirement amid an aging population and volatile markets. The company operates through two main segments: Annuities (90%+ of business) and Life Insurance. Its annuity portfolio emphasizes Fixed Index Annuities (FIAs, ~60% of sales), Multi-Year Guarantee Annuities (MYGAs, ~30%), and Fixed Rate Annuities (FRAs). FIAs offer principal protection with upside linked to market indices like S&P 500, appealing to risk-averse retirees. Life products include indexed universal life and whole life insurance. FG distributes via independent marketing organizations (IMOs), broker-dealers, and banks, with sales exceeding $10B annually. As of Q2 2024, assets under management (AUM) stood at ~$50B, backed by a conservative investment portfolio yielding ~5% (mostly investment-grade bonds).

Robust sales/investment trends outweigh rate risks; undervalued vs. peers (P/E 16x vs. sector 18x). Moderate risk via diversified portfolio.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $52 (20% upside from $43.28).

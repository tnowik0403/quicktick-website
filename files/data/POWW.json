(POWW) is a premier American ammunition and shooting sports company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, founded in 2016. The company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance \"brass\" and steel small-caliber ammunition for the military, law enforcement, and civilian markets. Its product portfolio spans centerfire rifle, handgun, and rimfire cartridges, emphasizing reliability, performance, and innovation under brands like Gunfighter, Jesse James Nomad, and Steel Tips. A key differentiator is its ownership of GunBroker.com (acquired in June 2021), the world's largest online marketplace for firearms, ammunition, and accessories, which generates significant e-commerce revenue and provides direct consumer insights. AMMO operates vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and recently expanded in Janesville, Wisconsin (production ramp-up started October 2024). With a focus on U.S.-made products, AMMO targets recreational shooters, hunters, competitive marksmen, and self-defense users amid cyclical demand driven by political events, shortages, and Second Amendment advocacy.

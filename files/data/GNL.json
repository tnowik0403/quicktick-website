(GNL) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on acquiring, owning, and managing a diversified portfolio of single-tenant net lease properties worldwide. Headquartered in New York, NY, GNL emphasizes properties leased to high-quality corporate tenants under long-term net leases, where tenants bear most operating expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance). As of Q2 2024, the portfolio comprises approximately 1,349 properties totaling 136.1 million rentable square feet across the U.S. (68%), Europe (29%), and other regions (3%). Key sectors include industrial/distribution (37%), retail (29%), office (20%), data centers (7%), and other (7%). \n\nMajor tenants include FedEx (6.6% of annualized base property revenue - ABPR), Cenveo (4.9%), and Walmart (3.5%). GNL targets properties with mission-critical uses, average lease terms of 8.8 years remaining (as of Q2 2024), and 97.1% occupancy. The company generates revenue primarily from rental income, benefiting from inflation-linked rent escalators (86% of leases). GNL went public via merger with a BREIT spin-off in 2017 and has grown through acquisitions, dispositions, and capital recycling. It pays a monthly dividend (current yield ~13.5% as of Oct 11, 2024), positioning it as a high-yield income play amid interest rate pressures on REITs. However, leverage (5.8x net debt/EBITDA as of Q2 2024) and tenant concentrations pose risks. GNL trades at a discount to NAV (~$20/share est. by management), appealing to value investors but challenged by macro headwinds.

Potential: Industrial expansions with logistics giants (e.g., Amazon-adjacent).\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n- **Buy Rating: 4/10 (Hold/Sell Lean)**: High yield tempting, but dividend cut risk (coverage weak), leverage, and sector rotation from office weigh on growth. Moderate risk appetite suits income, not strong upside (FFO flat; consensus PT $8.50, +7% from $7.92).\n- **Est. Fair Value: $9.50** (20% upside): Based on 10x 2025 AFFO ($0.95 consensus), 50% NAV discount closure on rate cuts. Growth limited to 2-4% annually; better for yield than appreciation.

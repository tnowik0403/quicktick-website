The company's portfolio includes open-air shopping centers and mixed-use destinations—such as Santana Row, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row—which together reflect the company's ability to create distinctive, high-performing environments that serve as vibrant destinations for their communities. Federal Realty's 103 properties include approximately 3,600 tenants in 27.9 million commercial square feet, and approximately 3,000 residential units.\n\nFederal Realty has increased its quarterly dividends to its shareholders for 58 consecutive years, the longest record in the REIT industry. The company is an S&P 500 index member, and its shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol FRT.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe Federal Realty Investment Trust stock price today is 100.80. The Federal Realty Investment Trust 52-week high stock price is 111.82, which is 10% above the current share price, while the 52-week low stock price is 80.65, which is 20.7% below the current share price.\n\nA market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion places FRT in the mid-capitalization category. According to 14 analysts, the average rating for FRT stock is \"Buy.\" The 12-month stock price target is $110.14, which is an increase of 8.19% from the latest price.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nFederal Realty operates across several property categories:\n\n**Mixed-Use Destinations:**\n- Santana Row: As Silicon Valley's most prestigious development, Santana Row opens the door to new opportunities.\n- Pike & Rose: A 24-acre, transit-oriented neighborhood including more than 50 tenants of thoughtfully merchandised retail space with restaurants (including Summer House Santa Monica, Fogo de Chao, &pizza, sweetgreen and Julii), retailers (including REI, Sephora, L.L.Bean and Sur La Table, Uniqlo), a state-of-the-art Porsche dealership, and unique entertainment offerings.\n- Assembly Row: Assembly Row embodies the newest form of American ingenuity, a cohesive and complete urban environment where Greater Boston comes to live, work and play.\n\n**Retail Properties:**\nFederal's retail portfolio includes grocery-anchored centers, superregional centers, power centers, and mixed-use urban centers.\n\n**Office Space:**\nThe company maintains an impressive 98% office occupancy rate, as of June 30, 2023.\n\n**Residential Units:**\n615 world-class rental apartments in the heart of Silicon Valley's vibrant Santana Row.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Development Pipeline:**\nDevelopment Pipeline includes 258 new residential units at Santana Row ($145 million committed), part of three projects totaling $280 million requiring capital; unlevered yields estimated at 6.5%-7%.\n\n**EV Charging Infrastructure:**\nIn July 2025, Federal Realty announced a first-of-its-kind agreement with Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging (HPC), naming the automaker its preferred electric vehicle (EV) charging provider. The collaboration establishes the foundation for a scalable rollout, expected to bring more than 500 ultra-fast charging stalls to at least 50 of Federal Realty's premier open-air retail destinations in its national portfolio. Each location will feature up to 10 charging stalls with 400 kW charging speeds, accessible to all drivers regardless of vehicle brand, with the first locations expected to come online in 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nRecent acquisitions have room for rent growth, as \"a lot of runway on the rents\" remains given prior underinvestment and suboptimal property management. No incremental acquisitions are included in mid-4% baseline recurring FFO growth guidance for 2026; any accretive acquisitions completed would provide upside to that baseline.\n\nFederal Realty has focused on owning assets in highly desirable areas with significant growth, and as a result, the average population density and average median household income are higher for its portfolio than for any other retail REIT.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Office Tenants:**\nGlobal tenants like Sodexo and Choice Hotel have selected Pike & Rose as their preferred locale for operations. Assembly Row serves as the North American headquarters for PUMA, which became an anchor tenant in 2019.\n\n**Retail Tenants:**\n- Village Pointe has a high-quality tenant mix that includes Apple, lululemon, Sephora, Nordstrom Rack and Scheels.\n- Annapolis Town Center is anchored by a high-volume Whole Foods, shadow-anchored by Target, and also features a Life Time luxury athletic club and a curated mix of national brands such as Anthropologie, Sephora, Restoration Hardware, and Williams Sonoma.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nQ3 2025 earnings showed FFO per diluted share of $1.77, net income per diluted share of $0.69, and robust leasing and occupancy metrics. Strong comparable operating income growth of 4.4% in the quarter led to FFO per share of $1.77.\n\n**Recent Performance:**\nIn 2024, FRT's revenue was $1.21 billion, an increase of 6.13% compared to the previous year's $1.14 billion. Earnings were $285.89 million, an increase of 25.58%.\n\n**Occupancy:**\nOccupancy in the comparable pool climbed 40 basis points last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 94%. On an overall occupancy basis, including all of our shopping centers, we stand at 93.8% today.\n\n**Liquidity:**\nThe company has significant liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion at quarter-end, comprised of availability on our $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility and over $100 million of cash at quarter-end.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The lack of new construction is contributing to scarcity, as only 7.9 million square feet of new shopping center space was delivered from the beginning of the year through Oct. 14, 2025. As of the third quarter of 2025, there are only 11.7 msf under construction with an inventory of 4.28 billion square feet.\n- Federal Realty reported a record leasing quarter with 123 comparable deals and achieved notable 28% rent spreads, indicating active tenant replacement and robust demand across its portfolio.\n- The retail property sector is today undersupplied. Federal Realty Investment Trust owns the best assets in this sector, positioning it for solid growth.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- The refinancing of $400 million of bonds in February is expected to create a headwind of 150 to 200 basis points on growth.\n- Federal Realty Investment Trust is still about 160 basis points below peak physical occupancy levels, with room for improvement.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nFRT has a market cap of a little over 8.5 billion dollars and has been in business for over 60 years. They are located in 13 states with 102 properties and 26 million square feet of retail space. Their properties have approximately 3,300 tenants and their residential portfolio includes 3,100 residential units.\n\nWhile Federal Realty is a significant player, it operates in a competitive landscape with larger REITs like Simon Property Group and Kimco Realty having larger market capitalizations and portfolios.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Simon Property Group:** Simon Property Group (SPG) is one of the largest and most diversified retail REITs in the US, known for its high-quality properties and strong tenant relationships. SPG specializes in a wide range of real estate properties, including shopping malls, premium outlets, and mixed-use properties.\n\n**vs. Realty Income:** Realty Income has provided the greater return for investors over the past 10 years and offers a slightly higher dividend yield for investors today, but it is valued slightly higher than Federal Realty Trust.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:** Federal Realty has strategically acquired and developed assets in submarkets with strong demand drivers, creating a portfolio with average location population density and median household income higher than any other retail REIT. As a result, Federal Realty has been able to drive strong same-store net operating income growth and average double-digit re-leasing spreads over the past two decades.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions (2025):**\n- Federal Realty announced the acquisition of Village Pointe in Omaha, NE for $153.3 million on Dec. 1, 2025. The open-air lifestyle center totals 453,000 square feet and draws nearly 6 million annual visits, serving a trade area of over 500,000 people.\n- Federal Realty announced the $187 million acquisition of Annapolis Town Center, a dominant, 480,000-square-foot open-air shopping destination in Anne Arundel County, Maryland on October 10, 2025.\n\n**Asset Dispositions:**\nFederal Realty completed the sale of two assets for combined proceeds of approximately $170 million as part of its capital recycling strategy on Dec. 17, 2025. These sales follow earlier 2025 dispositions, bringing total proceeds for the year to $316 million at a blended yield of ~5.7%.\n\n**Strategic Partnership:**\nFederal Realty's new partnership with Mercedes-Benz HCP further reinforces the strength of the company's premium brand and the caliber of companies that choose to partner with it.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Changes:**\nIn February 2025, Federal Realty announced key promotions within its leadership team, reinforcing the company's commitment to strategic growth and operational excellence across its national portfolio.\n\n**Earnings Timeline:**\nFederal Realty will announce its fourth quarter 2025 earnings results after market close on Thursday, February 12, 2026. The Company will host a conference call on Thursday, February 12 at 5:00 PM ET.\n\n**Capital Recycling Strategy:**\nThese transactions underscore the company's continued focus on active portfolio curation and disciplined capital allocation.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.8/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nFederal Realty demonstrates strong fundamentals with its record 58-year dividend growth streak, premium asset portfolio in high-demand coastal markets, and strategic positioning in undersupplied retail markets. The company's mixed-use developments and focus on affluent demographics provide competitive advantages. Recent acquisitions and EV charging partnerships show forward-thinking strategy.\n\nHowever, the rating is tempered by current occupancy levels still below peak, upcoming debt refinancing headwinds, and exposure to retail sector challenges despite premium positioning.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $115-120**\n\n**Justification:**\nAdding up discounted cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $143.78 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $101.80, the DCF output implies the stock trades at roughly a 29.2% discount. \n\nThe average 12-month price target for Federal Realty is USD111.81579, with a high estimate of USD137 and a low estimate of USD100.\n\nConsidering the company's premium market positioning, consistent dividend growth record, strategic mixed-use developments, and current discount to intrinsic value, a fair value range of $115-120 appears reasonable for investors seeking strong growth upside with moderate risk tolerance. The EV charging partnership and recent accretive acquisitions provide additional upside potential beyond the baseline FFO growth projections.",

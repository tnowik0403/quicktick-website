It owns, manages, and redevelops 101 high-quality retail and mixed-use properties totaling 23.0 million square feet, concentrated in affluent coastal markets across 10 states and Washington, D.C. FRT's portfolio is 95% leased (as of Q2 2024), anchored primarily by grocery stores (e.g., Whole Foods, Wegmans), which drive resilient foot traffic. The company emphasizes \"Power Centers\" and urban retail in top MSAs like San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, and South Florida, blending shopping, residential, office, and experiential elements (e.g., apartments above shops). FRT generates revenue through base minimum rents (86%), percentage rents, cost recoveries, and other fees. It has paid dividends for 57 consecutive years, recently increasing its quarterly payout. With a focus on redevelopment (investing $200M+ annually), FRT targets long-term net asset value (NAV) growth amid e-commerce pressures, positioning as a premium retail REIT with strong balance sheet (BBB+ rated, low leverage at 5.7x net debt/EBITDA).

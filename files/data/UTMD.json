(UTMD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024 (All data sourced from real-time web searches via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site utmd.com, EDGAR filings, and recent articles from Business Wire, GlobeNewswire as of this date)\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nUtah Medical Products, Inc. (UTMD) is a publicly traded (Nasdaq: UTMD) medical device company founded in 1978 and headquartered in Midvale, Utah. The company specializes in designing, manufacturing, and globally distributing single-use and reusable devices for niche critical care markets, primarily obstetrics (OB), gynecology (GYN), neonatal intensive care (NICU), intensive care (ICU), urology (URO), and electrosurgery (ES). UTMD's product portfolio emphasizes safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, serving hospitals, clinics, and alternate-site providers worldwide.\n\nKey revenue drivers include the U.S. (about 60-65% of sales) and international markets (Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America ~35-40%). UTMD operates with a lean, vertically integrated model, producing most products in-house at its Utah facility, which supports high gross margins (typically 50-60%). The company avoids heavy R&D spending by focusing on iterative improvements and regulatory-approved enhancements to proven devices rather than groundbreaking innovations.\n\nUTMD has built a reputation for financial discipline, with consistent profitability, no long-term debt, and a history of share repurchases and dividends. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 6, 2024), it reported revenue of $17.49 million (up 1% YoY), net income of $4.09 million (down 11% YoY), and EPS of $1.15.

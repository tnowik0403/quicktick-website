(REZI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Date of Report:** October 10, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close)\n\n## Company Overview\nResideo Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: REZI) is a leading provider of smart home comfort, security, and control products, primarily serving the residential market. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company operates through two main segments: ADI Global Distribution (a wholesale distributor of security, fire, and life-safety products) and Products & Solutions (P&S), which designs and manufactures connected home products under brands like Honeywell Home. Key offerings include thermostats (e.g., Honeywell T9/T10), whole-home security systems (e.g., Honeywell Home PROseries), water leak detectors, dehumidifiers, and professional HVAC services via Resideo Pro.\n\nOriginally spun off from Honeywell International in October 2018, Resideo has focused on leveraging IoT and smart home trends, with ~70% of revenue from North America. The company benefits from a vast installer network (over 100,000 pros via ADI) and direct-to-consumer channels like Amazon and Home Depot. In FY2023, it generated $6.7B in revenue, emphasizing subscription services (e.g., Lynx Touch monitoring) and pro services growth amid housing market stabilization. Recent strategic shifts include cost discipline, supply chain resilience post-COVID, and expansion into sustainability-focused products like energy-efficient HVAC controls. Challenges include margin pressures from inflation and competition from tech giants like Google Nest and Amazon Ring, but tailwinds from home automation demand (projected 15% CAGR through 2028 per Statista) position Resideo for mid-single-digit organic growth.

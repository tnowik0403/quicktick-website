Founded in 1897 and listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2013, the company provides a range of services including pawn loans (pledge lending), retail jewellery and watch sales, gold purchase and recycling, foreign exchange (FX), and unsecured personal loans via its Cash Management business. With over 280 stores primarily in England and Wales (as of H1 2024), H&T serves working-class and lower-middle-income customers seeking short-term liquidity solutions amid economic pressures. Pawn loans form the core (~50-60% of revenue historically), secured against personal valuables like gold jewelry, offering customers loans at effective APRs of 100-300% but with low default rates (<1% due to asset retention). The retail division sells pre-owned luxury items, while pawnbroking intake fuels scrap gold sales to refiners. FX services target travel hubs. H&T differentiates through scale, nationwide footprint, and digital enhancements like online valuations. In H1 2024 (ended June 30), revenue grew 13% to £164.0m (verified from July 24, 2024 interim results), driven by higher gold prices and lending volumes, with pre-tax profit up 20% to £15.8m.

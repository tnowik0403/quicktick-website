(AOMR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Latest Closing Price| $8.42         |\n| Market Capitalization | $146.2M     |\n| 52-Week High/Low    | $10.95 / $6.05|\n| Dividend Yield (TTM)| 15.20%        |\n| Shares Outstanding  | 17.37M        |\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAngel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. (AOMR), founded in 2018 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in residential mortgage investments. The company primarily invests in non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), including credit risk transfer (CRT) securities, re-performing loans (RPLs), and single-family rental (SFR) loans. AOMR targets attractive risk-adjusted returns by focusing on undervalued, performing or re-performing assets in the non-qualified mortgage (non-QM) and seasoned mortgage markets, which are underserved by traditional banks due to regulatory constraints post-2008 financial crisis.\n\nUnlike Agency-focused mREITs, AOMR emphasizes non-Agency assets for higher yields, leveraging proprietary underwriting via its affiliate, Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions. Its portfolio is ~90% floating-rate assets, providing natural hedges against rising interest rates. As of Q2 2024, the portfolio totaled $1.2 billion, with a leverage ratio of 3.5x. AOMR aims to deliver shareholder value through high dividend yields (currently ~15%) and book value growth. Operating in a $12 trillion U.S. residential mortgage market, AOMR occupies a niche in the ~$500B non-Agency RMBS segment, benefiting from housing shortages and demand for alternative lending.

Company Overview\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of pharmaceutical products globally. It operates in two segments, Diabetes and Obesity Care, and Rare Disease. The Diabetes and Obesity care segment provides products for diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, and other emerging therapy areas. Novo Nordisk A/S was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Bagsvaerd, Denmark. The Rare Disease segment offers products in the areas of rare blood disorders, rare endocrine disorders, and hormone replacement therapy. As of Jan 10, 2026, the company has 76.3K employees. The company has become a household name in the GLP-1 space, particularly with its diabetes and obesity treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 2026 Novo Nordisk has a market cap of $261.32 Billion USD. This makes Novo Nordisk the world's 59th most valuable company according to our data. However, there are varying market cap figures reported by different sources, ranging from $189.52B as of Jan 6, 2026 to $256.41B as of January 08, 2026, calculated by multiplying its current stock price of $57.685 by 4.45B outstanding shares.\n\nIts market cap has decreased by -45.42% in one year. Over the past month, it has risen by 29.08%, while the year-over-year change shows a -38.34% decrease.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Diabetes & Obesity Care Segment:**\n- Insulin pens, growth hormone pens, and injection needles. Smart solutions for diabetes treatment, such as smart insulin pens and Dose Check, an insulin dose guidance application.\n- Novo Nordisk makes a GLP-1 drug called semaglutide, which it sells as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes. Third-quarter sales of Wegovy were about $3.1 billion, 18% higher than a year ago, while Ozempic sales climbed 9% to $4.7 billion.\n- Despite launching in 2019 as the first oral GLP-1 for diabetes, Rybelsus brought in about $2.7 billion in sales for Novo last year.\n\n**Rare Disease Segment:**\n- Sales of Rare blood disorder products increased by 3% in both Danish kroner and at CER to DKK 12,138 million mainly driven by increased haemophilia B sales.\n- Sales of Rare endocrine disorder products increased by 30% measured in Danish kroner and by 31% at CER to DKK 4,993 million. Sogroya® has been launched in six countries, and the initial feedback from patients and physicians is encouraging.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Wegovy Oral Pill:** Novo Nordisk secured FDA approval for the first oral GLP-1 weight-loss drug, Wegovy, positioning it as a sector game changer. Novo Nordisk A/S launches oral Wegovy in the U.S. at aggressive introductory pricing, aiming to secure early market share and first-mover advantage. Novo Nordisk began rolling out an oral version of its injectable obesity drug Wegovy in the U.S. on Monday, offering a starting dose for cash-paying patients at $149 per month. Patients with insurance coverage can get the pill for as low as $25 a month.\n\n**CagriSema:** Novo Nordisk NVO announced the submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA, seeking approval for its next-generation once-weekly injection, CagriSema. CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and Novo Nordisk's blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg). In the REDEFINE 1 study, superior weight loss of 22.7% on average was achieved with CagriSema compared to 2.3% with placebo alone. Additionally, NVO reported that 40.4% of patients receiving CagriSema achieved a weight loss of 25% or more compared to 0.9% with placebo.\n\n**Other Pipeline Assets:** Amycretin is a unimolecular long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist under development by Novo Nordisk, to provide a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is under investigation for oral and subcutaneous administration.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n\"We are very pleased with the agreement to acquire the three Catalent manufacturing sites which will enable us to serve significantly more people living with diabetes and obesity in the future,\" said Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, president and chief executive officer at Novo Nordisk. \"The acquisition complements the significant investments we are already doing in active pharmaceutical ingredients facilities, and the sites will provide strategic flexibility to our existing supply network.\"\n\nIts availability on Amazon underscores Novo Nordisk's strategy to expand beyond traditional channels and reach new patients. Novo Nordisk is now offering Wegovy and Ozempic at $349 per month for cash-paying patients. Novo Nordisk is looking to increase access to these drugs for people without insurance coverage -- and perhaps dominate that market over the more expensive tirzepatide -- while undercutting the efforts of compounding pharmacies.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company has a collaboration agreement with UNICEF to tackle childhood obesity; and with Valo Health, Inc. to discover and develop novel drug programmes for cardiometabolic space.\n\nAmazon announced Friday it now offers Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight loss pill through its digital pharmacy. Its cash-pay option will start at $149 a month. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November.\n\nThe same day Lilly released its first-quarter earnings, Novo announced that its obesity GLP-1 Wegovy will be the preferred drug of CVS Carmark's standard formulary starting July 1. The arrangement with CVS will give Novo a huge boost by increasing access to Wegovy for CVS' patients \"at a more affordable price.\"\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2024 Results:**\nNovo Nordisk on Wednesday reported third quarter earnings broadly in line with expectations, said that its net profit in the third quarter hit 27.3 billion Danish kroner. Novo Nordisk added that sales of Wegovy were 79% higher year-on-year in the third quarter, coming in at 17.3 billion Danish kroner.\n\nGross Margin: Increased to 84.6% from 84.5% in 2023. Net Profit Increase: 18% increase. Diluted Earnings Per Share: Increased by 19% to DKK16.29.\n\n**2024 Full Year Performance:**\nNet profit increased by 21% to DKK 100,988 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 22% to DKK 22.63. The cost of goods sold increased by 24% measured in Danish kroner and by 25% at CER to DKK 44,522 million, resulting in a gross margin of 84.7% measured in Danish kroner, compared with 84.6% 2023. Sales increased by 25% measured in Danish kroner and by 26% at CER to DKK 290,403 million in 2024.\n\nNovo Nordisk's return on equity is 61.1%, and it has net margins of 32.9%. Novo Nordisk has been growing earnings at an average annual rate of 22.1%, while the Pharmaceuticals industry saw earnings growing at 8.6% annually. Revenues have been growing at an average rate of 21% per year.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**GLP-1 Market Position:**\nAs of Q2 2025, Eli Lilly holds approximately 57% of the GLP-1 market, overtaking Novo Nordisk earlier this year. But it has been losing market share. As of August, it had a 49.3% share of the global GLP-1 space, down from 55.7% the previous year.\n\n\"Novo Nordisk is the market leader with 53.9% measured by total monthly prescriptions and 50.0% measured by new-to-brand prescriptions,\" the company said. However, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish.\n\n**Weight Loss Drug Market:**\nBased on drug, the Semaglutide (Wegovy) segment accounted for the largest revenue share of 60.70% in 2024. Based on drugs, semaglutide (wegovy) segment led the market with the largest revenue share of 60.70% in 2024.\n\nGoldman Sachs projects that oral GLP-1s will generate roughly $22 billion in annual sales by 2030, capturing about 24% of the global weight-loss drug market. Within that segment, the bank expects Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share, or roughly $13.6 billion, of the daily oral segment. Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide is projected to capture about 21%, or around $4 billion.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Eli Lilly Competition:**\nEli Lilly manufactures a GLP-1 drug called tirzepatide, which it sells as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. Tirzepatide became the world's best-selling drug in the third quarter. In the first half of 2025, Mounjaro sales alone approached several billion dollars, putting it on track to challenge Novo's Wegovy/Ozempic for the highest sales in the weight loss/diabetes class. Combined, Lilly's tirzepatide franchise is on pace to exceed $8–10 billion annualized.\n\nDespite Novo Nordisk's recent efforts, Eli Lilly's momentum with tirzepatide is too much for the Danish company to handle right now. Eli Lilly should remain the leader in the GLP-1 market for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nThe approval gives the Danish pharma giant a head start against U.S. rival Eli Lilly. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Catalent Acquisition:**\nSOMERSET, NJ and COPENHAGEN, Denmark – December 18, 2024 – Catalent, Inc. (\"Catalent\"), a leader in enabling the development and supply of better treatments for patients worldwide, and Novo Holdings A/S (\"Novo Holdings\"), a global life sciences investment firm, today announced that Novo Holdings has completed its previously announced acquisition of Catalent in an all-cash transaction with a total enterprise value of approximately $16.5 billion.\n\nThe three fill-finish sites that Novo Nordisk will be acquiring are located in Anagni (Italy); Bloomington (USA); and Brussels (Belgium). Under the transaction, Novo Nordisk pays $11 billion upfront. The acquisition of the three sites will be completed immediately following the merger of Catalent and a Novo Holdings subsidiary.\n\n**Novavax Acquisition:**\nMeanwhile, earlier on Dec. 4, 2024, Novavax announced that it signed a definitive agreement to sell its manufacturing facility in Bohumil, Czech Republic, to Novo Nordisk for $200 million. Under the Novavax transaction, Novo Nordisk will gain that company's Bohumil manufacturing site.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nRecently, Novo Nordisk signed a $2.2 billion deal with Septerna for developing and commercializing oral small-molecule medicines for treating obesity, type II diabetes (T2D) and other cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Wegovy Oral Launch (January 2026):**\nAmazon announced Friday it now offers Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight loss pill through its digital pharmacy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the pill version of Wegovy in December. The pricing of the weight loss pill is the same as Novo Nordisk's announcement on Monday. The 1.5-milligram daily pill costs $149 per month for patients paying out of pocket.\n\n**Clinical Trial Updates:**\nThe FDA is expected to review the application in 2026. for CagriSema approval. These updates confirm that Novo Nordisk is moving ahead with the pediatric program. For the market, this update supports the long-term growth story for Novo Nordisk in diabetes and weight management beyond adults.\n\n**Supply Chain Improvements:**\nLast week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said all doses of Wegovy were now available in the U.S. after previously noting that the lowest dose of Wegovy was in short supply. The news was taken as a signal that Novo Nordisk's efforts to ramp up supplies of Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic are paying off.\n\n**Guidance Revisions:**\nThe company narrowed its sales growth outlook for the full year 2024 to 23% to 27% from 22% to 28% at constant exchange rates and tightened its operating profit growth guidance to come in at 21% to 27%, versus the previously expected 20% to 28%.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus:**\nThe 4 analysts that cover Novo Nordisk stock have a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and an average price target of $54.25, which forecasts a -3.64% decrease in the stock price over the next year. Based on 9 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Novo Nordisk in the last 3 months. The average price target is $55.23 with a high forecast of $70.00 and a low forecast of $42.00. The average price target represents a -2.37% change from the last price of $56.57.\n\n**Investment Outlook:**\nOut of 12 Wall Street analysts covering the stock, six of them recommend buying shares. Their consensus 12-month target price for the stock has fallen to $53.40, but that still signals 11.0% upside in the next 12 months from the current share price. Meanwhile, 24/7 Wall St. projects that the share price will end next year at $65.52.\n\n**Long-term Projections:**\nOur price target for 2027 is $79.56. We predict a price of $85.93. Our price target is $104.58. Our target price is $107.66. Cumulatively, 24/7 Wall St. anticipates Novo Nordisk to appreciate almost 124% by the end of the decade.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\nNovo Nordisk's revenue growth has dropped significantly over the past two years. The company was forced to revise its guidance downward several times in recent quarters. The changes suggest that Novo Nordisk's revenue growth could slow even further in 2026. However, I expect the company's results to stabilize. There is an indication that the company's pipeline candidates will see strong progress in 2026.\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 7/10 (Buy)**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Novo Nordisk receives a **Buy** rating of **7/10** for a growth-oriented portfolio with moderate risk appetite. Key supporting factors include:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- First-mover advantage with oral Wegovy pill\n- Strong pipeline with CagriSema showing 22.7% weight loss results\n- Aggressive capacity expansion through Catalent acquisition\n- Market leadership in GLP-1 diabetes treatments\n- Strong financial metrics (84.7% gross margin, 32.9% net margin)\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Losing market share to Eli Lilly in obesity treatments\n- Multiple guidance downgrades in recent quarters\n- High competitive pressure in the GLP-1 space\n- Stock down significantly from highs\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $65-70**\n\nGiven the current trading range around $50-57, the stock appears undervalued relative to its long-term potential, supported by its innovative pipeline, manufacturing expansion, and strategic positioning in the growing obesity market. The oral Wegovy launch and pending CagriSema approval provide catalysts for recovery, though near-term headwinds from competition and pricing pressure remain.",

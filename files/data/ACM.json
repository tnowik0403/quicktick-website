Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company operates in two primary segments: Americas (73% of FY2024 revenue) and International (27%), serving markets including transportation, water, environment, energy, and facilities. With approximately 50,000 employees across 150+ countries, AECOM focuses on sustainable, resilient infrastructure amid rising global demand driven by urbanization, climate change, and government spending initiatives like the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).  \n\nThe firm emphasizes high-margin design-led services (86% of backlog as of Q4 FY2024), maintaining a record backlog of $45.3 billion (up 5% YoY). AECOM differentiates through digital innovation (e.g., AI-driven design tools), ESG commitments (net-zero by 2040), and a shift toward mission-critical, resilient projects. Recent profitability improvements stem from portfolio optimization, cost discipline, and strategic wins in high-growth verticals like U.S. transit ($10B+ pipeline) and international water/power.

Founded in 2006 as a spin-off from Texas Instruments' sensors business, Sensata has evolved into a $4B+ revenue company with ~22,000 employees worldwide. Its core offerings include pressure, position, temperature, speed, and force sensors; fuses, circuit breakers, and relays for protection; and controls for industrial automation and power management.\n\nThe company operates in two main segments: Performance Sensing (65-70% of revenue, focused on automotive and heavy vehicle sensors for braking, ride control, HVAC, and electrification) and Sensing Solutions (30-35%, targeting industrial, aerospace, and medical applications like flow meters and encoders). Sensata benefits from secular trends in vehicle electrification (EV/HEV battery monitoring, power distribution), advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), industrial automation (IIoT), and aerospace recovery post-COVID. With manufacturing in 15 countries and R&D centers in the US, Europe, and Asia, Sensata holds strong positions in niche markets, such as ~40-50% share in automotive brake pressure sensors. Challenges include cyclical auto production and supply chain volatility, but its diversified portfolio and ~$1B backlog (as of Q3 2024) provide resilience.

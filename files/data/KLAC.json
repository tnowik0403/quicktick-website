Company Overview\n\nKLA Corporation is an American company based in Milpitas, California that makes wafer fab equipment. It supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries. The company, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and markets process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries worldwide. The company operates through three segments: Semiconductor Process Control; Specialty Semiconductor Process; and PCB and Component Inspection.\n\nKLA Corporation is a global leader in semiconductor process control, specializing in wafer inspection and metrology tools essential for maximizing chip manufacturing yields. The company's key R&D activities during fiscal year 2024 involved the development of process control and process-enabling solutions for a broad range of industries including semiconductors and PCBs. The strength of the company's competitive positions in many of its existing markets is primarily due to its leading technology, which is the result of significant investments in product R&D.\n\nThe company was formed in 1997 as KLA-Tencor through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. In January 2019, KLA-Tencor announced that they were changing their name to KLA Corporation. The company's name change took effect in July 2019.\n\n## 2.

KLA Corp shares climbed 2.0% Monday, closing at $1,428.17—a fresh 52-week high that topped the previous peak of $1,406.97 from January 6.\n\nAs of January 13, 2026, KLA shares are valued at $1,438.68. The company's market cap stands at $189.03 billion, with a P/E ratio of 43.95 and a dividend yield of 52.9%.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nKLA offers inspection and review tools to identify, locate, characterize, review, and analyze defects on various surfaces of patterned and unpatterned wafers; metrology systems to measure pattern dimensions, film thickness, film stress, layer-to-layer alignment, pattern placement, surface topography, and electro-optical properties for wafers; chemical process control equipment; wired and wireless sensor wafers and reticles; wafer defect inspection, review, and metrology systems; reticle inspection and metrology systems; wafer inspection and metrology systems; and semiconductor software solutions.\n\nThe company has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major process diagnostics and control (PDC) subsegment—photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology.\n\nService revenues (23.2% of total revenues) increased 15.6% year over year and 6% sequentially to $744.7 million. In terms of major products, Wafer Inspection and Patterning Systems (including metrology and reticle inspection) accounted for 48% and 21%, respectively, of KLA's total revenues in the fiscal first quarter.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nLooking ahead, KLA's 2026 roadmap aligns with the industry's transition to sub-2 nm nodes and hybrid bonding technologies. The company is expanding its capabilities in EUV and High-NA lithography process control, as well as 2D/3D metrology, to address the precision demands of next-generation chips.\n\nKLA's new R&D facility in Wales (opened May 2025) supports development across advanced packaging, power devices, MEMS, RF, and photonics sectors.

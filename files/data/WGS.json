(NASDAQ: WGS) is a leading genomics diagnostics company specializing in pediatric and rare disease genetic testing. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Stamford, CT, GeneDx pioneered whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for clinical diagnostics, processing over 650,000 exomes to date. The company serves pediatricians, geneticists, and neurologists primarily in the U.S., with a focus on neurodevelopmental disorders, cardiology, and oncology. In 2023, it spun off from Sema4 (formerly acquired by OPKO Health) and went public via SPAC merger in 2022.\n\nGeneDx's core value lies in its massive proprietary database (>650,000 patient exomes, one of the world's largest), enabling >20% diagnostic yield—double the industry average. Revenue is driven by test volumes (85% of sales), with recurring tests like carrier screening and newborn sequencing. In Q2 2024, it reported its first quarterly GAAP profit ($760K net income), fueled by 52% YoY revenue growth to $65.9M and 57% gross margins.

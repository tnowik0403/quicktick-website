Rationale: Resilient 3-4% room growth, international tailwinds (India 10%+ CAGR), undervalued at 12x EV/EBITDA vs. peers (historical 14x). CEO interim risk offset by strong Q2 momentum; post-merger clarity boosts M&A optionality. Moderate risk via cyclical lodging exposure.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $105 (22% upside from $86.09). Based on 14x FY2025E EBITDA ($1.42B consensus) + 3% growth premium; DCF implies $100-110 (BofA/Barclays targets align). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns. Hold if risk-averse on macro slowdown.",

Following the 2020 divestiture of its wireless operations to T-Mobile US, Inc. for approximately $710 million (with additional contingent payments), Shentel has pivoted to a broadband-centric model. Its primary subsidiary, Shenandoah Telecommunication Company (Shentel), offers high-speed fiber-optic broadband under the Glo Fiber brand, fixed wireless access (FWA), cable television, telephone services, and managed IT/hosting solutions to residential, business, and carrier customers. As of Q2 2024, Glo Fiber passed over 200,000 locations, emphasizing symmetric gigabit speeds to underserved rural and suburban markets. The company serves ~30,000 wireless subscribers (via MVNO with T-Mobile), 13,000 cable TV subs, and a growing broadband base of ~70,000. Shentel targets fiber overbuilds in competitive markets and greenfield expansions, leveraging $400+ million in annual capital investments to capture share in a fragmented regional telecom landscape. With a focus on operational efficiency post-wireless sale, Shentel reported Q2 2024 broadband revenue growth of 18.5% YoY, driven by Glo Fiber subscriber additions of 5,200 (Source: Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, August 8, 2024).

Riley: Buy, $28 PT, Sep 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold/Buy lean) – Attractive fiber growth (15%+ CAGR potential) justifies premium to peers, but capex/debt tempers upside. Moderate risk via regional focus; strong for growth portfolios eyeing rural broadband.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $24.50 (35% upside from $18.15) – Based on 8x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($300M projected) + DCF (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth); aligns with consensus PT $25.20 (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11, 2024).

(NYSE: ASO) is a leading U.S. specialty retailer focused on sporting goods and outdoor recreation. Headquartered in Katy, Texas, the company operates approximately 282 stores across 20 states, primarily in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest, with a store base concentrated in high-growth Sun Belt regions. Academy offers a broad assortment of ~55,000 SKUs across eight categories: Camping & Outdoors (~24% of sales), Hunting & Firearms (~22%), Apparel (~13%), Water Sports & Recreation (~12%), Team Sports (~10%), Footwear (~9%), Exercise Equipment (~6%), and Racquet Sports (~4%). It emphasizes value pricing, everyday low costs, and an omnichannel model blending physical stores (avg. 55,000 sq ft) with e-commerce (academy.com, buy online/pickup in-store). Founded in 1938, Academy went public in Oct 2021 via IPO backed by private equity (BPCM/Partners Group). FY2023 sales were $5.59B; it serves middle-income consumers (avg. ticket ~$50) seeking affordable gear for hunting, fishing, camping, fitness, and team sports. With a focus on store expansion (target 160-180 new stores over 5 years), private-label growth (Magellan brand), and digital enhancements, Academy captures demand from rising outdoor participation post-COVID. Recent challenges include soft consumer spending, but its value proposition and regional dominance position it for recovery.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Sep 5, 2024**: Q2 FY2024 earnings – Net sales $1.44B (-3.7% YoY); comparable store sales -4.9%; diluted EPS $1.24 (beat est. $1.22); gross margin 37.8% (+190bps YoY); operating income $242.3M; raised FY2024 sales guidance to $5.475B-$5.575B (flat YoY) and EPS to $5.30-$5.60 (vs. prior $5.20-$5.50).\n- **Aug 15, 2024**: Announced 14 new store openings in FY2024 (total 18 YTD as of Q2 call), including entries into OK, MS, AL; long-term goal 300+ stores.\n- **Jul 2024**: Launched enhanced app with personalized recommendations; e-commerce sales +10% YoY in Q2 (per transcript).\n- **Jun 11, 2024**: Q1 FY2024 earnings – Sales $1.37B (+0.9% YoY); comp sales -0.6%; EPS $1.61 (beat est.).\n- **Oct 10, 2024**: Stock dipped 5% amid broader retail weakness (Dick's Sporting Goods Q3 comp guidance miss); analyst chatter on X/StockTwits highlights \"value trap\" vs. undervaluation at 7x FY2025 EV/EBITDA.\n- **Ongoing**: Firearms sales recovery (+mid-single digits Q2) post-2022 regulatory pauses; hunting season prep emphasized in earnings call.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Store Expansion**: 18-20 new stores in FY2024 (up from 15 in FY2023); 160-180 over next 5 years in 10 new states (e.g., AR, MO expansions).

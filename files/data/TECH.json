Avoid aggressive buy amid macro caution.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $65 (37% upside from $47.62) - Based on 20x FY2026 EV/EBITDA (core growth 5-7% normalized), DCF with 10% WACC/moderate risk (strong balance sheet: $380M cash, net debt/EBITDA 1.5x). Targets strong growth portfolio with 20-30% 2-year upside if spatial hits 25% growth.",

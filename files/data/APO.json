(NYSE: APO) is a leading global alternative asset manager founded in 1990, specializing in private equity, credit, and real assets. With approximately $733 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of June 30, 2024, Apollo focuses on generating superior risk-adjusted returns for institutional and high-net-worth investors through flexible capital solutions. The firm operates across three core segments: Asset Management (private equity, hybrid value, opportunistic credit), Retirement Services (via its Athene annuity platform, which Apollo owns ~88% of), and Principal Investing (legacy direct investments). Apollo's strategy emphasizes \"flow\" businesses like private credit origination and insurance-linked assets, differentiating it from traditional buyout-focused peers. Athene, Apollo's embedded insurance arm, drives fee-related earnings (FRE) growth by channeling retail premiums into Apollo-managed credit strategies, creating a durable, high-margin revenue stream. Recent scaling in private fixed income (origination >$100B annually) positions Apollo as a non-bank lender amid regulatory constraints on traditional banks. The firm targets middle-market credit, real estate debt, and infrastructure, with a growing emphasis on perpetual capital vehicles for retail investors. Apollo's flexible mandate and deep origination network have fueled 20%+ annualized AUM growth since 2020, though it faces cyclical risks in credit markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024):** Reported record fee revenue of $919 million (up 42% YoY), FRE of $1.2 billion (up 50% YoY), and adjusted net income of $1.2 billion (up 136% YoY).

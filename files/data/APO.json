The firm serves as a financing partner of choice for large corporates, sponsor-backed businesses, specialty lending platforms and more, helping companies to access flexible solutions at competitive costs of capital to fuel their growth.\n\nPrivate Equity is the cornerstone of Apollo's equity business, with $69 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2025.

A transformative event was Apollo's merger with Athene Holding in 2022 – effectively bringing the insurance company fully under Apollo's ownership.

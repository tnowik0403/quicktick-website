Headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana—the \"RV Capital of the World\"—the company operates through two main segments: the Replacement Segment (aftermarket parts via its CURT and EZ-Loader brands) and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Segment (components for new builds). Key products include steel chassis, axles, suspension systems, leveling and stabilization jacks, windows, vents, plumbing fixtures, towing products, and marine hardware. With over 170 manufacturing and distribution sites across North America, Europe, and Asia, LCI generated $4.00 billion in 2023 net sales, deriving ~70% from RV OEMs, 15% from MH, and the balance from marine/transportation/aftermarket. The company benefits from a fragmented supplier base, giving it pricing power and customer stickiness due to its broad portfolio and just-in-time delivery model. Post-COVID RV boom normalization has shifted focus to diversification into high-margin aftermarket (25%+ of sales) and adjacent markets like cargo trailers and powersports, positioning LCI for resilient growth amid cyclical OEM demand.

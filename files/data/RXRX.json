Daily Volume (3-mo)**: 6.8 million shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~270 million\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage TechBio company revolutionizing drug discovery through industrial-scale biology decoding. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Recursion leverages its proprietary Recursion Operating System (OS), a massive multimodal dataset (the Recursion Data Universe, now >65 petabytes with 60+ trillion relationships), and AI/ML models to map biological relationships, identify novel targets, and accelerate therapeutic development. Unlike traditional pharma, Recursion operates at the intersection of tech and biotech, using automation labs, high-throughput screening, and generative AI (e.g., Phenom series models) to derisk drug candidates across rare diseases, oncology, neuroscience, and more.\n\nThe company's pipeline includes four clinical-stage programs: REC-994 (Phase 2 for cerebral cavernous malformation, topline data expected H1 2025), REC-2282 (Phase 2/3 for neurofibromatosis type II, interim data Q4 2024), REC-4881 (Phase 2 for familial adenomatous polyposis, data H2 2024/H1 2025), and REC-3964 (Phase 1 for Clostridioides difficile, data H2 2024). Revenue is primarily from collaborations, with a cash runway into mid-2026 (~$509M as of Q2 2024). Recursion aims to create the world's largest proprietary bio-data asset, partnering with pharma giants while building an internal pipeline. Recent AI advancements, like the BioHive-2 supercomputer (NVIDIA-powered, #2 fastest globally per TOP500 June 2024), position it as a leader in AI-driven discovery, potentially compressing timelines from 10-15 years to years. However, as a pre-revenue clinical biotech, it faces high R&D burn and binary clinical risks.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q filed Aug 14, 2024):\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n  |-------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n  | Revenue                 | $14.2M | $10.2M | +39%      |\n  | R&D Expenses            | $104.1M| $79.0M | +32%      |\n  | G&A Expenses            | $42.3M | $34.9M | +21%      |\n  | Net Loss                | ($203.1M)| ($98.0M)| Widened   |\n  | Cash & Equivalents      | $509M  | N/A    | Runway to mid-2026 |\n  - Revenue beat driven by Roche and Bayer milestones; narrowed non-GAAP loss to ($0.50)/share vs. consensus.\n- **September 4, 2024**: Expanded Bayer oncology collaboration (initial 2022 deal worth up to $1.5B); new targets in solid tumors, $50M upfront payment expected Q4 2024.\n- **October 3, 2024**: Announced presentations at BIO Investor Forum (Oct 7-8), highlighting pipeline and AI platform.\n- **September 2024**: Workforce reduction of ~20% (237 roles) to extend cash runway; part of cost discipline post-Q2.\n- **July 22, 2024**: Roche neuroscience expansion (2023 deal up to $12B potential); first joint program nomination.\n- Online buzz (StockTwits, Reddit r/RXRX, Seeking Alpha): Bullish on Bayer expansion and AI compute (BioHive-2); bears cite cash burn ($400M+ annualized) and no Phase 3 data.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: (1) Scale Recursion OS and Data Universe via partnerships/internal programs; (2) Advance 5+ clinical assets to proof-of-concept; (3) Monetize via upfront/milestone/royalties (target 10+ deals); (4) Leverage AI efficiency (e.g., Phenom-1 model discovered 10x more hits).\n- **2024-2025 Catalysts**: 4 clinical readouts, 2-3 partnership expansions, AI platform licensing.\n- **Long-term**: Become \"OS for biology,\" aiming for 20-30% market in computational drug discovery by 2030.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n| Category   | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company**| Strong partnerships (>$3B committed); AI leadership (NVIDIA collab); $509M cash. | High burn ($350-400M 2024 guidance); clinical risks (all Phase 1/2); 20% layoffs signal execution pressure. |\n| **Sector** | AI-biotech hype (e.g., NVDA +200% YTD); $100B+ annual drug discovery spend; FDA AI guidance (2024). | Biotech funding crunch (VC down 30% 2024); high interest rates; trial delays (e.g., 40% Phase 2 fail rate). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Recursion OS**: AI platform for target ID, MOA prediction; licensed to partners.\n- **Pipeline**:\n  | Program    | Indication                  | Stage     | Next Milestone          |\n  |------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|\n  | REC-994   | Cerebral Cavernous Malformation | Ph2     | Topline H1 2025        |\n  | REC-2282  | NF2                        | Ph2/3    | Interim Q4 2024        |\n  | REC-4881  | FAP                        | Ph2      | Data H2 2024/H1 2025   |\n  | REC-3964  | C. diff                    | Ph1      | Data H2 2024           |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Preclinical**: 10+ programs (e.g., oncology from Bayer/Roche); AXS-05 integration (from Axsome M&A?

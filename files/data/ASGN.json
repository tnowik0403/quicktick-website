Founded in 1985 and headquartered in Glen Allen, Virginia, ASGN operates through three main segments: Apex Systems (commercial IT staffing and consulting), Oxford (life sciences, engineering, and IT staffing), and ASGN Technologies (federal IT solutions, including mission-critical systems engineering via ECS). The company delivers flexible talent solutions, managed services, and technology offerings in areas like cybersecurity, cloud computing, data analytics, AI/ML, and digital transformation. With over 34,000 consultants on assignment, ASGN addresses skills gaps in high-demand sectors. In FY2023, it generated $4.55B in revenue (verified from Q2 2024 10-Q filing), with ~70% from commercial clients and 30% from federal. ASGN's model emphasizes high utilization rates (85-90%), cross-selling across segments, and recurring revenue from managed services (20-25% of total). Positioned in the $150B+ U.S. IT services/staffing market, ASGN benefits from secular trends like digital modernization and talent shortages but faces cyclical pressures from tech spending. Its acquisition-driven growth has expanded federal exposure, enhancing margins amid commercial volatility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 31, 2024, transcript via Seeking Alpha/Motley Fool):** Revenue $1.072B (flat YoY); Net Income $73.3M (down 5% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $173M (16.1% margin, up 20bps); EPS $1.73 (beat estimates by $0.11).

(NYSE: UBER) is a global leader in on-demand mobility and delivery platforms, operating in over 70 countries and 15,000+ cities as of Q2 2024. Founded in 2009, Uber revolutionized transportation with its ridesharing app, connecting riders with drivers via real-time matching technology powered by AI, GPS, and machine learning. Its core segments include Mobility (ride-hailing, including UberX, Uber Black, Comfort), Delivery (Uber Eats for food/groceries), and Freight (logistics for shippers/carriers). In 2023, Uber completed 9.4 billion trips and delivered 2.3 billion orders, generating $37.3 billion in revenue. The company has evolved into a \"super app\" ecosystem, adding advertising (launched 2022, $1B run-rate), Uber for Teens (under-18 service), and autonomy partnerships. Uber turned GAAP profitable in 2023 (net income $1.9B) after years of losses, driven by cost discipline, scale, and diversification. With 150,000+ employees/contractors and a focus on profitability (18% adjusted EBITDA margin target by 2024 end), Uber navigates regulatory scrutiny while pursuing AV tech and emerging markets. Recent Q2 2024 results showed robust 17% gross bookings growth to $41B, positioning it for $40B+ annual bookings amid rising urban demand and e-commerce.

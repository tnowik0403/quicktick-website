Existing Products/Services\n\n**Mobility:** Although the overarching theme between all three is commissioning, their business model is actually split into three different streams: Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. \"Mobility\" is the sector that is associated with Uber by most of the public. It allows customers to call for rides on demand through their phone, akin to their mission statement, \"make movement happen at the tap of a button\". Transportation through Uber is more convenient for a consumer than a taxi because it is easily accessible through an app and connects them with a huge network of drivers, over 5 million worldwide.\n\n**Delivery (Uber Eats):** The \"Delivery\" sector functions primarily out of a subsidiary of Uber, Uber Eats. Uber Eats is a direct competitor to other food delivery technology companies such as Doordash, Grubhub, and Instacart.\n\n**Freight:** Finally, the \"Freight\" sector, unfamiliar to most typical Uber users, works to connect shippers to carriers digitally, allowing for more transparency in pricing and availability, and increasing convenience through their user-friendly platform.\n\n**Uber for Business:** Uber for Business is a global platform for managing rides, meals, and deliveries. Since 2014, we've helped over 150,000 companies delight employees and customers alike through commute programs, meal offerings, on-demand delivery, and more.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Autonomous Vehicles:** Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER) today announced it is working with NVIDIA to accelerate the next generation of robotaxi and autonomous delivery fleets using NVIDIA AI Architecture. Through this partnership, Uber plans to greatly expand its global autonomous fleets. As part of this effort, Stellantis will be among the first OEMs to deliver at least 5,000 NVIDIA-DRIVE-powered L4 vehicles to Uber for robotaxi operations in the United States and internationally.\n\n**Lucid-Nuro Robotaxi:** Uber on Monday unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi, a driverless vehicle developed with electric carmaker Lucid and autonomous technology firm Nuro, as it moves closer to deploying its own self-driving cars in San Francisco. The production-intent vehicle debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and is already being tested on public roads in the Bay Area, the companies said.\n\n**Autonomous Delivery Robots:** The delivery partnership will launch first with sidewalk robots on Uber Eats in Austin in the coming weeks, before expanding to Dallas and Jersey City, New Jersey, later this year. The mobility partnership is expected to launch for riders in Dallas later next year.\n\n**Starship Partnership:** Starship Technologies, a leading autonomous delivery technology platform, and Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER), the largest mobility and delivery platform in the world, today announced a global collaboration to roll out autonomous sidewalk robot delivery across multiple markets. The partnership will start with the UK in December, followed by multiple European countries in 2026, and U.S. expansion planned for 2027.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Autonomous Vehicle Integration:** 2024 was a turning point for the [AV] industry. With firms like Waymo, WeRide, and Baidu delivering fully autonomous rides in limited geofenced areas, and others – including Tesla and Zoox – advancing rapidly, Khosrowshahi noted the sector's \"magic\" moment as more consumers experience driverless trips.\n\nThese partnerships exemplify Uber's \"neutral marketplace\" strategy: it doesn't own the AV technology but connects riders with autonomous fleets. This model reduces capital intensity and allows Uber to scale rapidly.\n\n**Geographic Expansion:** With international regulatory frameworks still evolving, Uber made inroads with a global launch of AVs in Abu Dhabi and plans to expand further in 2025. With international regulatory frameworks still evolving, Uber made inroads with a global launch of AVs in Abu Dhabi and plans to expand further in 2025.\n\n**Partnership Strategy:** Instead of creating its technology, Uber now partners with leading autonomous vehicle (AV) companies, including Waymo, Pony.ai, Wayve, and Baidu's Apollo Go. These partnerships enable Uber to deploy autonomous rides in major global cities across the U.S., U.K., China, and the Middle East.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Uber for Business Clients:** Ryder has requested more than 100,000 rides for customers by integrating with Uber's API, enabling the company to better allocate staff time and resources. The Golden State Warriors teamed up with Uber for Business to find innovative ways to elevate the fan experience at the Chase Center.

Market Shares\n\n**Rideshare Market:** Looking at the rideshare competitors' market share, the breakdown of March 2024 observed sales between Uber and Lyft remained consistent compared to the prior month. In March 2024, Uber accounted for 76 percent of observed U.S. rideshare spending, about the same as in February 2024.\n\n**Food Delivery Market:** With a market share of 67 percent, DoorDash dominated the online food delivery market in the United States as of March 2024. Meanwhile, Uber Eats held the second highest share with 23 percent. By the end of 2024, DoorDash led the national food delivery market with a 60.7% share, ahead of Uber Eats (26.1%) and Grubhub (6.3%).\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs Lyft:** Being almost synonymous with the ride-sharing industry, Uber's share of the U.S. market has fluctuated between 68 and 76 percent since 2017. The remaining market is dominated by Lyft, which accounted for 24 percent of the market in March 2024.\n\n**vs DoorDash:** DoorDash has about 67% of the food delivery space market share, with Uber Eats in a distant second and Grubhub even further behind in third place. The answer to DoorDash's dominance thus far in the delivery wars might be simple. Uber is the bigger company, but it is stretched between two main revenue categories (ridesharing and delivery), and Grubhub just doesn't have the same number of resources that the other two have.\n\n**Delivery Time Performance:** While, for many of the study's categories, the three delivery services were neck-and-neck, DoorDash blew the competition out of the water for delivery times. DoorDash's average delivery time was 26 minutes and 24 seconds for restaurants, while Grubhub was 35 minutes and 49 seconds. Uber Eats was 38 minutes and 4 seconds — almost 50% longer than DoorDash's average delivery time.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Autonomous Vehicle Partnerships:** The rideshare giant has unveiled strategic collaborations with autonomous vehicle solution providers Momenta, Pony.ai, and WeRide—each aimed at deploying robotaxi fleets across key international markets beginning in late 2025 and 2026.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 8.5/10**\n\n**Fair Value Target: $125-$135**\n\n**Analysis Summary:**\nUber demonstrates exceptional execution on multiple fronts that warrant a strong buy rating:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The company posted its first operating profit in 2023. and has sustained profitability\n- Its full-year 2024 free cash flow climbed to $6.9 billion, well above expectations. It also introduced a $1.5-billion stock buyback programme, signalling confidence in its long-term trajectory.\n- Dominant market positions: 76% rideshare market share, 26% food delivery share\n- Strategic autonomous vehicle positioning through partnerships rather than capital-intensive development\n- Uber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n**Growth Catalysts:**\n- Autonomous vehicle rollout across global markets reducing long-term operational costs\n- By 2026, Uber aims to deploy AVs globally via Momenta, a Chinese tech partner, signaling its ambition to dominate robotaxi markets outside the U.S. Uber's financial transformation is equally compelling. In Q1 2025, it reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $2.25 billion, a 66% year-over-year jump, fueled by disciplined capital allocation and operational efficiency.\n- Expanding Uber for Business enterprise client base\n- International expansion opportunities\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Regulatory headwinds including FTC lawsuits and sexual assault litigation\n- Intense competition from DoorDash in food delivery\n- Autonomous vehicle execution risk and timeline uncertainty\n- Potential economic downturn impact on discretionary spending\n\n**Valuation Justification:**\nAt current levels around $87, Uber trades at attractive multiples given its growth profile and cash generation. Still, the stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 19 times 2026 earnings estimates. That's quite a low valuation for a business with such healthy and profitable growth. The target range of $125-$135 represents a 43-54% upside and reflects:\n- Premium valuation for sustainable profitable growth\n- Autonomous vehicle option value\n- Market leadership positions across multiple verticals\n- Strong free cash flow generation and capital returns\n\nThis represents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the evolving mobility ecosystem with strong near-term fundamentals and transformative long-term potential.",

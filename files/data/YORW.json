YORW sources water from the Susquehanna River and 38 wells, treating and distributing it through a network of over 1,100 miles of pipelines. The company also provides wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal services to around 42,000 people in 34 communities via 370 miles of lines and three treatment plants. As a fully regulated entity under the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), YORW benefits from stable rate structures tied to infrastructure investments, with ~75% of revenues from water services and ~25% from wastewater. It emphasizes reliability, with 99.99% uptime, and invests heavily in capital projects for compliance and expansion. With a market cap of ~$546 million and shares trading at $38.92 (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq), YORW delivers consistent dividends (3.84% yield, 200+ years of payments) but faces growth constraints in its niche geography.

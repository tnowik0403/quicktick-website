(CVCO) is a premier designer, producer, and retailer of factory-built housing solutions in the United States, specializing in HUD-code manufactured homes, park model recreational vehicles (RVs), cabins, modular homes, and commercial structures. Founded in 1965 and headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, the company operates through two main segments: Factory Manufactured Housing (78% of Q1 FY2025 revenue) and Financial Services (22%). Cavco owns leading brands such as Cavco Homes, Fleetwood Homes, Palm Harbor Homes, Fairmont Homes, and Destiny Homes, with 12 manufacturing facilities across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and Indiana. It also runs a retail network of 90 company-owned locations under brands like Rodeway Homes and Friendship Homes, serving affordable housing markets. The company benefits from vertical integration, including mortgage servicing via Cavco Financial Services (servicing $1.1B in loans as of Q1 FY2025). Amid a U.S. housing shortage exceeding 4M units, Cavco addresses demand for cost-effective alternatives to site-built homes (20-50% cheaper), with products customizable for single-family, multi-family, and vacation markets. Recent fiscal strength stems from higher wholesale shipments and retail sales, positioning CVCO as a resilient player in a fragmented $12-15B manufactured housing industry.

(NASDAQ: NATR) is a leading natural health and wellness company founded in 1972, specializing in herbal, vitamin, mineral, and dietary supplements. Operating through a global direct selling model, the company markets its products via an independent distributor network in over 40 countries, emphasizing high-quality, science-backed formulations free from artificial additives. Key brands include Nature's Sunshine (core supplements), Synergy Worldwide (targeted nutrition), and Sunshine Heroes (children's products). The company focuses on botanicals like Thai-Go (antioxidant), Chlorophyll (detox), and probiotics, alongside categories such as immune support, digestive health, and personal care.\n\nNATR generates ~75% of revenue internationally, with strong footholds in Asia-Pacific (e.g., Japan, South Korea), Americas (Mexico, Venezuela), and Europe. FY2023 revenue was $457.8M, driven by a distributor base of ~500,000 active members. The model incentivizes distributors through commissions and retail sales, fostering loyalty amid rising consumer demand for natural wellness post-COVID. Challenges include regulatory hurdles in supplements and competition from e-commerce giants, but tailwinds from health trends and international expansion position NATR for steady growth.

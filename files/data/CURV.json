Founded in 2001 and headquartered in City of Industry, California, Torrid operates ~580 stores across 49 US states and Canada, plus torrid.com and Curv.com (intimates-focused).

Upside if digital hits 55% mix.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (FY2023/LTM) | CURV | Lane Bryant (priv.) | Eloquii (ASTR) | ASOS Curve |\n|---------------------|------|----------------------|----------------|------------|\n| **Revenue** | $1.23B | ~$800M (est.) | $50M (ASTR total) | Segment of $4B |\n| **Stores/Digital Mix** | 580 / 50% | 200 / 60% | Online-only | Global online |\n| **Comps Trend** | -2% | Flat | +5% | -10% |\n| **Gross Margin** | 37% | 42% | 45% | 38% |\n| **EV/Sales** | 0.8x | N/A | 0.5x (ASTR) | 0.3x |\n| **Edge** | Store footprint | Brand heritage | Designer focus | Price/selection |\n\nCURV leads in scale/physical presence but lags on margins/growth vs. digital pure-plays.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Influencer network (e.g., Ashley Gudmundson); Mackenzie-Childs home collab (2023, extended); Good American pop-ups (2024).\n- **M&A**: None recent. 2021 IPO; past acquisition of assets from Ascena (Lane Bryant parent).\n- **Major Clients**: B2C direct-to-consumer only (no wholesale). Key cohorts: Millennials/Gen Z (80% customers), loyalty members (80% sales).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Size inclusivity scores high (diversity campaigns); sustainability via recycled fabrics (10% assortments).\n- **Management**: CEO Melanie Boulden (since Oct 2023) emphasizes \"traffic first\"; board refresh post-activist pressure (Mackenzie Wilson 2023).\n- **Risks**: $300M revolver covenant pressures if EBITDA misses; apparel cyclicality.\n- **Opportunities**: TikTok Shop entry (testing); potential tuck-in M&A for digital assets.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **3/10 (Sell)**  \n  Rationale: Weak fundamentals (declining revenue guidance, negative comps, high leverage amid slowing plus-size growth); limited near-term catalysts despite newness/store tweaks. Stock trades at 0.4x FY2024 EV/Sales (vs. peers 0.5-1x) but downside risk to $4 if Q3 misses (due Nov 2024). Moderate risk appetite unsuitable—high volatility (beta 2.1).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $6.50 (28% upside from $5.06).  \n  DCF-based (8% discount rate, 2% terminal growth, FY2024 EBITDA midpoint); assumes comp stabilization FY2025. Strong growth portfolios should avoid; wait for +5% comps inflection. Hold for turnaround believers.",

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Magnolia's core assets are concentrated in two premier South Texas resource plays: the Eagle Ford Shale in Karnes County (Western Eagle Ford) and the Giddings Field, spanning the Downdip Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations across multiple counties (e.g., Brazos, Burleson, Fayette). The company employs a disciplined, capital-efficient strategy emphasizing multi-well pad drilling, high-density completions, and extended laterals to maximize returns on its high-quality, oil-weighted inventory.\n\nAs of year-end 2023, Magnolia reported proved reserves of 402 MMboe (57% oil, 29% NGLs), with a reserve life index of ~13 years at 2023 average production rates. In 2024, it has shifted emphasis toward the Giddings Field, which offers lower breakevens (~$40-45/WTI half-cycle) and a deeper inventory (>3,500 locations). Magnolia prioritizes free cash flow (FCF) generation for shareholder returns, including a base dividend, variable dividends, and share repurchases under a $600M authorization (initiated 2023). Q2 2024 average production hit 88.4 MBoe/d (64% oil + NGLs), underscoring operational efficiency amid volatile commodity prices. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with net debt of ~$0.5B (Q2 2024) and liquidity >$500M, positioning it as a resilient mid-cap E&P player in a consolidating sector.

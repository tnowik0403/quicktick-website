(NASDAQ: VYGR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $7.80         |\n| Market Cap      | $442.1 million |\n| 52-Week Range   | $4.29 - $12.28 |\n| Avg. Volume     | 1.05 million shares |\n\n**Company Overview** (248 words)  \nVoyager Therapeutics, Inc. (VYGR) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in gene therapy for neurological disorders, leveraging its proprietary TRACER™ (Tropism Redirection of AAV by Cell-type-specific Expression of Reporter genes) capsid discovery platform. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Voyager designs adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with high efficiency and specificity for central nervous system (CNS) targets, addressing key limitations in traditional gene therapies. The company's pipeline targets Parkinson's disease, ALS, Friedreich's ataxia (FA), and other monogenic CNS disorders.  \n\nVoyager has no approved products and generates revenue primarily through collaborations. Its TRACER platform has produced over 15 novel capsids since 2022, enabling partnerships with major pharma players. Key assets include VY-AADC01 (Phase 1b/2a for advanced Parkinson's, partnered with Novartis), VY-SOD101 (preclinical for SOD1-ALS), and programs in FA with Neurocrine Biosciences. Recent platform advancements include TRACER-HEM6 and TRACER-DOG1 capsids, validated in non-human primates (NHPs) for BBB penetration. Voyager ended Q2 2024 with $238.3 million in cash, providing runway into H2 2026. The company focuses on de-risking its platform through preclinical data readouts and clinical milestones to drive licensing deals and potential spin-offs, positioning it as a CNS gene therapy innovator in a market projected to grow from $5.5B in 2024 to $15B+ by 2030 (per Grand View Research).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q).

The company operates through five segments: Marine, Aviation, Outdoor, Fitness, and Auto. Its core products include smartwatches, fitness trackers, aviation avionics, marine chartplotters, handheld GPS devices, and automotive navigation systems. Garmin's competitive edge lies in its rugged, battery-efficient devices tailored for niche markets like multisport athletes, pilots, and boaters, integrating advanced GNSS, health sensors (e.g., ECG, Pulse Ox), and mapping software.\n\nIn 2023, Garmin generated $5.23 billion in revenue, with Fitness (wearables) at ~28%, Outdoor ~24%, Aviation ~20%, Marine ~16%, and Auto ~12%.

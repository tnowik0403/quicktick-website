(FDP) is a vertically integrated global producer, marketer, and distributor of high-quality fresh and fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, the company operates through four segments: Bananas (46% of 2023 revenue), Pineapples (13%), Avocados & Non-Bananas (29%), and Prepared Food/Fresh-Cut (12%). It grows produce on company-owned farms and leased plantations across Latin America (e.g., Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico), the Philippines, and Africa, sourcing from independent growers. FDP distributes to retailers, wholesalers, foodservice, and club stores worldwide, with key markets in North America (60%+ sales), Europe, and Asia. Emphasizing sustainability, it pioneered Rainforest Alliance-certified bananas and invests in traceability tech. With ~35,000 employees, FDP reported 2023 revenue of $4.43B (down 4% YoY) amid banana price pressures but maintains a strong balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~1.5x). Recent strategic shifts include divesting non-core fresh-cut assets to focus on core fresh produce amid rising demand for healthy, premium items.

Open to bolt-ons in avocados.\n- **Major Clients**: Top 10 customers = 45% sales (Walmart 15%, Kroger 10%, Publix 8% est.). Potential: Amazon Fresh expansion (pilots Q4 2024); Sysco foodservice growth.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top 10% in food sector (S&P Global 2024); Water usage -25% since 2019.\n- **Management**: CEO Abu-Ghannam (since 2023) driving portfolio optimization; Board refresh (2 new directors 2024).\n- **Risks**: FX exposure (50% sales international); Geopolitical (Latin America ops).\n- **Sentiment**: Analyst consensus Hold (avg PT $28.50, range $25-32; Barclays Oct 3, 2024: $26 PT).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold). Steady dividends (recent $0.25/share quarterly) and asset sale unlock value, but limited growth (1-3% CAGR) vs. sector peers amid commodity volatility. Moderate risk tolerance fits; not strong growth play.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $28.00 (25% upside). Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($225M midpoint guidance; peers 8-9x) + $60M sale proceeds. DCF supports $26-30 range assuming 2% rev growth, 14% margins. (Moderate risk: Beta 0.6; dividend buffer).",

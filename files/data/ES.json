Formed in 2012 from the merger of Northeast Utilities and NSTAR, Eversource operates through three main segments: Electric Distribution (serving ~3.3 million electric customers), Natural Gas Distribution (~3.7 million gas customers), and Water Distribution (~331,000 water customers). The company focuses on reliable energy delivery, grid modernization, and the clean energy transition, investing heavily in transmission infrastructure, renewables integration, and offshore wind support projects. With a regulated rate base of ~$42 billion (as of Q2 2024), Eversource benefits from stable, predictable cash flows but faces regulatory scrutiny and capital-intensive growth. It emphasizes electrification, EV infrastructure, and decarbonization goals aligned with state mandates like Massachusetts' net-zero by 2050 and Connecticut's clean energy targets. Recent strategic shifts include exiting certain offshore wind developments to focus on onshore transmission and distribution reliability.

Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- Competitive pressures include comparisons to National Grid and Avangrid in New England markets, municipal utilities and co‑ops in localized areas. Principal adjacent rival in Massachusetts and the broader Northeast; competes on regulatory outcomes, cost efficiency, and customer satisfaction where footprints overlap.\n- Key competitors include National Grid, Avangrid, and Unitil\n- CMS Energy, Public Service Enterprise Group, Xcel Energy, NiSource, and Unitil are some of the 28 competitors of Eversource Energy\n\n**Competitive Position:**\n- Eversource Energy, with a market cap of 25.1B, ranks among mid-sized competitors in this industry dominated by several large utilities exceeding 40B in market capitalization\n- Eversource Energy does not present a competitive advantage as its return on invested capital (ROIC) is below its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), indicating value destruction with declining profitability. The company's ROIC trend over 2020-2024 is negative, reflecting a very unfavorable economic moat.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Strategic Moves:**\n- In 2024 Eversource exited its 50% partnership with European utility Orsted to develop 2 gigawatts of offshore wind projects in the Northeast US\n- Eversource expanded its service territories with acquisitions of NStar (2012), Aquarion (2017), and Columbia Gas (2020).

Recent Developments\n\n**Q3 2025 Earnings (November 2025):**\n- Strong earnings recovery with net income of $367.5M ($0.99/share), up from a loss of $118.1M in Q3 2024, with non-GAAP recurring earnings at $442.5M ($1.19/share)\n- Offshore wind contingent liability increased by $284M in Q3 2025, resulting in a $75M after-tax charge\n\n**Aquarion Sale Development (January 2026):**\nA Connecticut judge on Thursday said that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority erred in its November decision to block the sale of the Aquarion Water Company and sent the deal back to regulators for further deliberations.

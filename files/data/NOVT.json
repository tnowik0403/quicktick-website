(NOVT) is a leading global technology company specializing in precision photonic, motion, and robotic solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the medical and advanced industrial sectors. Headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, with ~2,700 employees across 25+ locations worldwide, Novanta operates through two main segments: **Medical** ( ~60% of revenue, focusing on surgical robotics, diagnostics, and ophthalmology) and **Advanced Industrial** ( ~40%, targeting semiconductor, aerospace, and electronics manufacturing). \n\nThe company designs, manufactures, and sells core enabling technologies such as custom laser systems, optical encoders, digital video microscopy, precision motion control, and power generation/electronics products. These components enhance OEM end-products like robotic surgery systems (e.g., da Vinci), laser-based therapies, and advanced automation tools. Novanta's competitive edge lies in its vertically integrated R&D, high-margin custom solutions, and focus on high-growth niches like minimally invasive surgery and factory automation. \n\nFounded in 2016 via a merger of GSI Group and Calmar Optcom, Novanta has pursued a roll-up strategy, achieving a 10-year revenue CAGR of ~12% through organic growth and 10+ acquisitions. In FY2023, it generated $895M in revenue, with ~75% from recurring OEM partnerships. The firm benefits from secular tailwinds in medtech (projected 5-7% CAGR) and industrial robotics (8-10% CAGR), positioning it as a mission-critical supplier amid rising demand for precision automation.

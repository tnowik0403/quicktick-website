(NASDAQ: RGLD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**  \n- **Stock Price**: $169.24  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $11.10 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $110.50 - $170.43  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 32.8  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.06% ($1.80 annualized)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRoyal Gold, Inc. (RGLD) is a leading precious metals streaming and royalty company headquartered in Denver, Colorado, founded in 1981. The company provides non-dilutive, alternative financing to mining operators by purchasing stream and royalty interests in exchange for upfront cash payments. Streams typically grant RGLD the right to buy a fixed percentage of a mine's gold, silver, or other metal production at a fixed low cost (e.g., 25% of spot price), while royalties provide a percentage of revenue (typically 1-5%) from specified properties without delivery obligations.  \n\nAs of Q2 FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), RGLD's portfolio spans 40 producing royalties/streams and over 45 development-stage assets across six continents, primarily focused on gold (82% of revenue equivalent), silver (13%), and copper (emerging). Key producing assets include streams from Nevada Gold Mines' Cortez (U.S.), Peñasquito (Mexico), Mount Milligan (Canada), and royalties on Andacollo (Chile). The business model offers leverage to metal prices with low operational risk—no mining costs, fixed CapEx, or labor issues borne by RGLD—yielding high margins (average ~89% gross margin historically). In FY2023, it generated $495M revenue; the royalty/stream model supports scalable growth via M&A and new deals amid miners' preference for balance sheet-friendly financing over equity/debt. RGLD emphasizes ESG, with a strong track record of low-cost production and alignment with junior miners scaling Tier 1 assets.

(NYSE: ZTS) is the global leader in animal health, spun off from Pfizer in 2013, with a portfolio spanning medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, diagnostics technologies, and services for companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats) and livestock (e.g., cattle, swine, poultry). Headquartered in Parsippany, NJ, Zoetis operates in over 100 countries, generating ~55% of revenue from the U.S. and ~45% internationally. Its companion animal segment (55% of 2023 revenue) focuses on dermatology (e.g., Apoquel, Cytopoint), parasiticide (e.g., Simparica Trio), and pain management (e.g., Librela). The livestock segment (45%) emphasizes vaccines, anti-infectives, and genetic tests for food production efficiency. Zoetis invests heavily in R&D (~8-9% of revenue annually), leveraging biologics, precision medicine, and digital tools. With 2023 revenue of $9.1 billion (up 11% operational), it benefits from pet ownership trends (\"humanization\"), rising global protein demand, and preventive care shifts. The company holds a dominant ~20-25% global animal health market share, outpacing fragmented competitors, and pursues growth via innovation, M&A, and emerging markets like Asia/LatAm.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 6, 2024):** Revenue $2.39 billion (+9% reported, +10% operational); adjusted diluted EPS $1.51 (+12%).

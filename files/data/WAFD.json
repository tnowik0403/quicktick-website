(WAFD) is the bank holding company for WaFd Bank, a community-focused thrift institution with approximately $21.0 billion in total assets as of Sep 30, 2024. Headquartered in Seattle, WA, WaFd operates over 250 branches across eight western U.S. states: Washington (110+ branches), Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, California, and Texas. The bank specializes in relationship-based banking for consumers, businesses, and real estate investors, with a loan portfolio heavily weighted toward multifamily residential (47% of loans), commercial real estate (CRE, 25%), and commercial/business loans (15%). Deposits fund 95%+ of assets, emphasizing low-cost core deposits (98% FDIC-insured, transaction accounts ~45%). WaFd differentiates through its \"thrifty\" heritage—origins in the 1910s savings & loan era—focusing on high-credit-quality multifamily loans secured by rent-regulated properties in strong markets like Seattle and Portland. It offers digital banking enhancements, wealth management via Wasmer, Schroeder & Company (acquired 2021), and small business services. Recent balance sheet growth stems from organic expansion and the $607M acquisition of Luther Burbank Corporation (Dec 2023), adding 25 branches in CA and strong multifamily expertise. WaFd targets middle-market clients, avoiding high-risk C&I or consumer lending, positioning it resiliently amid regional bank pressures.

(NYSE: J) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $144.45\n- Market Capitalization: $17.89 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $119.26 - $154.62\n- Average Daily Volume (3 months): 1.06 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nJacobs Solutions Inc. (J) is a Fortune 500 global professional services firm headquartered in Dallas, Texas, specializing in technical, professional, and construction services. With over 60,000 employees across 400 offices in 50+ countries, Jacobs delivers end-to-end solutions in engineering, design, procurement, construction management, and consulting. The company operates through two main segments: Critical Mission Solutions (CMS, ~35% of revenue) focusing on high-tech domains like space exploration (e.g., NASA contracts), cyber, aerospace, and defense; and Sustainable Solutions (SS, ~65%) targeting infrastructure, water, transportation, environmental remediation, and life sciences.\n\nJacobs emphasizes sustainability and resilience, aligning with global megatrends such as climate change adaptation, energy transition, and digital transformation. Key markets include U.S. federal government (NASA, DoD), utilities, transportation authorities, and pharmaceuticals. FY2023 revenue was $16.4 billion (verified from Q4 FY2023 earnings, November 21, 2023), with a backlog of $29.5 billion signaling strong visibility. The firm has divested non-core assets (e.g., $13B sale of HPC-AI business to H.I.G. Capital, announced October 2023, closed March 2024) to streamline into high-margin, growth areas. Jacobs positions itself as a \"connected\" solutions provider, leveraging AI, digital twins, and modular construction to drive efficiency. Recent rebranding to Jacobs Solutions underscores focus on integrated, mission-critical projects amid geopolitical tensions and infrastructure booms (e.g., IIJA in U.S.).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (August 6, 2024)**: Revenue $4.7B (up 2% YoY), adjusted EPS $2.18 (beat estimates), backlog $31.2B (up 6%).

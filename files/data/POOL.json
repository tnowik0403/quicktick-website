Company Overview\n\nPool Corporation (POOL) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products, and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. The company was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Covington, Louisiana. At the end of 2024, the group had 448 sales centers located in the United States (400) and overseas (47), with the United States accounting for 93% of net sales.\n\nPool Corporation operates through a comprehensive business model serving multiple customer segments.

The company's business improved significantly during the COVID-19 lockdowns due to an increase in pool construction. However, sales slowed when the lockdowns ended.

Existing Products/Services\n\nPool Corporation offers a comprehensive portfolio across multiple product categories:\n\n**Maintenance Products:** Chemicals, supplies, and pool accessories; repair and replacement parts for pool equipment, such as cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps, and lights.\n\n**Construction Materials:** Building materials, such as concrete, plumbing and electrical components, functional and decorative pool surfaces, decking materials, tiles, hardscapes, and natural stones for pool installations and remodeling.\n\n**Equipment and Systems:** Pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools; irrigation and related products, such as irrigation system components, and professional turf care equipment and supplies; commercial products, including heaters, safety equipment, commercial decking equipment, and commercial pumps and filters.\n\n**Outdoor Living Products:** Fiberglass pools, and hot tubs and packaged pool kits comprising walls, liners, braces, and coping for in-ground and above-ground pools; and other pool construction and recreational products which consist discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products, such as grills and components for outdoor kitchens.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nPool Corporation continues to invest in digital capabilities and private label expansion. It continued to enhance its digital capabilities through expanded adoption of its POOL360 applications and unveiled a strategic roadmap focused on innovation and growth.\n\nThe company is expanding its technological infrastructure: For the quarter, sales through the tool represented an all-time high of 17% of total sales for the third quarter, which demonstrates the customer's desire for technology that creates value. While still in the early stages, this growth shows the output of our technology investment over the past few years. Our targeted spend in our digital ecosystem is driving tech experience, accelerating private label and exclusive product growth, and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, we strive to expand our Pool Corporation-branded products and exclusive brand offerings. Along with growth in orders process, we observed double digit growth in our private label chemical sales, further highlighting our progress from the streamlined abilities of the POOL360 Water Test and POOL360 Service.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nPool Corporation's growth strategy centers on multiple pillars: network expansion, technology investment, acquisition opportunities, and market penetration through its Pinch A Penny franchise network.\n\n**Network Expansion:** We completed one acquisition during the quarter, adding two locations in key markets. Additionally, we opened one greenfield, bringing our year-to-date opening to six sales centers. We remain on track for additional openings in the fourth quarter to reach eight to 10 new sales centers for the full year.\n\n**Franchise Growth:** Our Pinch Penny franchise network added its first store in Arizona, positioning us to expand into this key do it yourself market. With three stores opening this quarter, we are now coming close to 300 Pinch a Penny franchisees. Our Pinch A Penny franchise network added one new store in the quarter, adding to our Arizona presence and bringing the Pinch A Penny locations to 303 franchise stores.\n\n**International Expansion:** However, it will still take some time before that international expansion has any meaningful effect on revenue. With only 5% of total sales coming from outside North America, even if international sales doubled right now, it wouldn't have a major effect on total revenue.\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions:** Pool Corp added two new acquisitions in 2024 and plans to allocate $25–$50 million for further expansion in 2025 according to market analysis. These moves aim to consolidate market share in fragmented segments and diversify revenue streams.\n\n## 6.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Pool Corp. sells pools and everything needed to maintain them, but demand has cooled off as consumers' budgets have grown strained. Higher revenue growth will be required for the stock to rally, but if sales remain flat or decline, the share price could continue to slide.\n- While macroeconomic headwinds such as tariff uncertainty and elevated borrowing rates persist, management expects relief from recent rate policy easing and remains confident in its ability to outperform industry trends.\n- The proposed tariffs, such as the steep duty on Chinese imports, will sharply increase costs for essential pool equipment like pumps, filters and automation systems.\n- Chemical deflation created mild headwinds here, while DIY consumers continue to be hesitant with discretionary purchases like cleaners and above-ground pools, spas, and some equipment.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- We continued to support sustained customer demand for maintenance products and were pleased to see further improvement in sales for building materials products.\n- During the quarter, the company stated benefits from steady maintenance demand and early signs of stabilization in new pool construction and remodel activity. Given the diversified product mix, strong private-label portfolio and strategic vendor alliances, the company is optimistic and anticipates driving growth in the upcoming periods.\n- Our business is seasonal. In general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of swimming pool use, pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities.\n\n## 9.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 6.5/10**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Pool Corporation receives a moderate \"Buy/Hold\" rating of 6.5 out of 10. This rating reflects the company's strong market-leading position and resilient maintenance-driven revenue model, balanced against current macroeconomic headwinds and sluggish discretionary spending.\n\n**Key Strengths Supporting the Rating:**\n- Dominant 40% market share in a fragmented industry\n- Stable maintenance revenue (~62% of business) providing defensive characteristics\n- Strong cash generation and shareholder returns ($303M returned in Q3 2025)\n- Successful digital transformation with POOL360 driving 17% of sales\n- Strategic Pinch A Penny acquisition expanding retail presence\n- Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway endorsement with significant stake increase\n\n**Key Concerns Limiting the Rating:**\n- Revenue decline of 4.16% in 2024 with challenging demand environment\n- Discretionary spending pressures affecting construction and renovation segments\n- Elevated valuation metrics despite recent price decline\n- Limited international exposure (5% of sales) constraining growth opportunities\n- Macro headwinds including potential tariffs and elevated borrowing costs\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $295-$320**\n\nBased on current fundamentals, analyst price targets, and considering the company's defensive characteristics combined with near-term growth challenges, a fair value range of $295-$320 per share appears reasonable. This represents potential upside of 21-32% from current levels around $243, assuming:\n\n1. Gradual recovery in discretionary spending by late 2026/2027\n2. Continued market share gains through network expansion\n3. Successful integration and expansion of Pinch A Penny franchise\n4. Maintenance of current dividend policy and capital allocation discipline\n5. Normalization of gross margins as cost pressures ease\n\nThe lower end of the range assumes continued macro pressures, while the higher end reflects potential for earlier recovery and successful execution of growth initiatives. This valuation aligns with analyst consensus targets averaging $304-$318 and provides attractive risk-adjusted returns for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite.",

The company operates through three main sales networks: Superior Pool Products (SPP), Scott Pool Products (SCP), and Pool Builders Supply (PBS), serving approximately 120,000 customers—including pool builders, retailers, and service professionals—via over 430 sales centers across North America (primarily U.S.), Europe (France, UK, etc.), and Australia. POOL does not manufacture products but focuses on distribution, holding exclusive rights to brands like Zodiac in certain regions. In 2023, it generated $5.5 billion in revenue, with ~80% from the U.S., driven by new pool construction (~40% of sales) and pool maintenance/renovation (~60%). The company benefits from a fragmented market, scale advantages in logistics/inventory, and a \"one-stop-shop\" model, enabling high gross margins (historically 25-30%). POOL's business is cyclical, tied to housing markets, consumer spending, and weather, but recurring maintenance sales provide stability. As of October 11, 2024, POOL's stock trades at $304.49 with a market capitalization of $11.44 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com real-time data).

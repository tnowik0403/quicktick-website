Founded in 2015 as a spin-off from Masco Corp, the company operates nationwide through ~220 branches, serving primarily new construction (single-family homes ~70% of Installation segment revenue) and the repair/remodel (R&R) market. Its two segments—Installation (90% of revenue) and Specialty Distribution (10%)—focus on energy-efficient insulation products (fiberglass, spray foam, cellulose), garage doors, rain gutters, and other waterproofing solutions. TopBuild benefits from the U.S. housing shortage (>4M unit deficit per Freddie Mac, Sep 2024) and regulatory pushes for energy efficiency (e.g., IECC 2021 codes). With a fragmented market (top players hold <20% share), TopBuild has grown via 100+ tuck-in acquisitions since inception, achieving 20%+ CAGR in revenue. Q2 2024 results showed resilience amid high rates: net sales $1.38B (+5.2% YoY), Installation segment $1.25B (+5.8%), gross margin 33.4%, adjusted EBITDA $308M (+8%).

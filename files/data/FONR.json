The company designs, manufactures, and services proprietary MRI systems, with a focus on its patented Open Upright MRI™ technology—the only FDA-cleared MRI for imaging patients in weight-bearing positions (up to 500 lbs), enabling unique diagnostics for spine, joint, and soft tissue issues under natural load. Fonar operates two segments: Manufacturing/Service (develops/sells MRIs) and Management (operates 29 MRI scanning centers across New York, New Jersey, Florida, and California as of Q4 FY2024). These centers generate ~95% of revenue via fee-for-service scans, serving outpatient markets with high-volume, non-hospital imaging. Fonar emphasizes non-invasive, patient-friendly tech amid rising demand for musculoskeletal diagnostics. With ~100 employees, it holds niche leadership in upright MRI (est. 80-90% U.S. market share per company filings). FY2024 revenue hit $148M (verified Q4 FY2024 earnings, Sep 12, 2024), driven by scan volume growth and scanner sales. Challenges include reimbursement pressures, but tailwinds from aging populations and imaging demand support steady expansion.

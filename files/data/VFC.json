Founded in 1899 as a hosiery business, VF has evolved through acquisitions into a powerhouse owning brands like The North Face (premium outdoor apparel/gear), Vans (casual footwear/apparel), Timberland (rugged boots/outdoor), Dickies (workwear), and others including Altra (running), Icebreaker (merino wool), and Supreme (streetwear, acquired 2022). In FY2024 (ended March 2024), VF generated ~$10.5B in revenue, with ~45% from North America, 35% Europe, and the rest international. The company operates a dual-channel model: direct-to-consumer (DTC, ~45% of sales via 1,200+ owned stores and e-commerce) and wholesale (~55% to retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods and Amazon). VF's \"Reinvent\" transformation emphasizes brand reinvention, operational efficiency, and debt reduction amid post-pandemic challenges. Recent leadership changes and strategic shifts aim to revive core brands like Vans, which faced steep declines, while leveraging The North Face's resilience in a $400B+ global apparel/footwear market.

Moderate risk appetite favors waiting for Q2 execution proof.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $24 (26% upside from $19.04). Based on 10x FY2026E EBITDA ($1B est.), discounted for execution risk; assumes 2% revenue growth, 55% margins. Strong growth upside requires Vans +10% FY2026 (plausible per Barclays note). Hold current levels; buy below $17.",

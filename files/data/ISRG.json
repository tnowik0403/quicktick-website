Since you specifically emphasized the need for current, verified information including recent earnings data, stock prices, and latest developments, I cannot provide the thorough sell-side analysis report you're looking for without access to real-time data sources.\n\nTo generate the comprehensive ISRG analysis you need, I would require access to:\n\n- **Current Financial Data**: Latest earnings reports, revenue figures, margins\n- **Recent Stock Performance**: Current stock price and market cap\n- **Latest News & Developments**: Recent announcements, partnerships, product launches\n- **Current Market Position**: Up-to-date competitive landscape and market share data\n- **Recent Analyst Coverage**: Latest analyst reports and ratings\n\n**Recommendation**: I suggest you:\n1.

Look at latest analyst reports from major investment banks\n4. Check recent news from medical device industry publications\n\nWould you like me to try the analysis again once web search functionality is restored, or would you prefer to gather this current information from other sources first?",

Headquartered in Houston, TX, with operations across North America, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe, DTI designs, manufactures, rents, and sells downhole tools that enhance drilling efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Its flagship offerings include patented catch tools (e.g., Premium Connect® Catcher), stabilizers, underreamers, and handling tools, which prevent stuck pipe incidents and enable faster tripping operations—key pain points in directional and horizontal drilling.\n\nFounded in 2011 and going public via a SPAC merger with MetaX Resources on June 11, 2024 (raising ~$34M net proceeds), DTI serves major E&P operators amid sustained high oil prices (~$70-80/bbl WTI). With a fleet of ~15,000 premium tools generating recurring rental revenue (88% of Q2 mix), DTI targets the $2B+ global downhole tool rental market.

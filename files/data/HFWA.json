Top 10 clients <15% loan concentration.\n- **Potential**: Expanding to tech SMEs in Boise/Spokane amid remote work boom; targeting $500M in new C&I from dislocated SVB clients.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\" 2024); 20% renewable energy financing.\n- **Management**: CEO tenure 10+ years; aligned incentives (40% ownership by execs/insiders).\n- **Risk Profile**: TCE ratio 10.2% (Q3); stress-tested for 2008 scenario.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 4 Buy/3 Hold (avg PT $26 from 7 analysts, per MarketBeat Nov 1, 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold with upside bias). Solid fundamentals, dividend appeal, and NIM resilience support holding; growth limited by CRE but tailwinds from rate cuts justify moderate buy for growth-oriented portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $27.50 (18% upside). Based on 12x 2025E EPS $2.10 (consensus), 1.1x TBV $25, discounted cash flow modeling 8% ROE growth. Moderate risk: CRE sensitivity offset by deposit strength.",

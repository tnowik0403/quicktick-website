Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares  \n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~94.5 million  \n\n*Note: RPAY shares trade at a discount to the $12.00 acquisition price announced July 22, 2024, due to pending regulatory approvals.

Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Repay offers end-to-end payment solutions including credit/debit card processing, ACH payments, virtual terminals, mobile payments, and e-invoicing/billing software. The company focuses on high-volume, recurring revenue verticals such as automotive (repair shops, dealerships), healthcare (dental, veterinary), hospitality (restaurants, convenience stores), business services (property management, consumer finance), and government.  \n\nRepay's platform integrates seamlessly with vertical SaaS partners, enabling \"embedded payments\" where payments are built into industry-specific software. This \"payfac-as-a-service\" model drives same-store growth through higher transaction volumes and take rates. As of Q2 2024, Repay processed $15.2 billion in total processing volume (TPV), serving ~35,000 merchants. Revenue is primarily same-store (organic) driven, supplemented by M&A tuck-ins. The company has pursued aggressive expansion via 20+ acquisitions since 2018, building a fragmented market presence. Recent strategic pivot emphasizes de novo vertical wins and SaaS partnerships amid a stabilizing payments landscape post-COVID.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 22, 2024**: Nuvei Corporation (NVEI) announced definitive agreement to acquire Repay for $1.65 billion in cash ($12.00/share, 35% premium to prior close).

Ideal for growth upside/moderate risk portfolios betting on H2 2024 close. Hold if risk-averse; avoid if regulatory pessimism grows.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $12.00 (100% weight to acquisition price; 20-30% premium justifies if synergies materialize).

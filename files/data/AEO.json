Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, AEO operates primarily through its two flagship brands: American Eagle (AE), offering jeans, tops, hoodies, and outerwear with a focus on trend-right casual styles, and Aerie, a intimates and activewear brand launched in 2006 that has grown into a standalone powerhouse with bras, underwear, apparel, and skincare via its Offline sub-brand.

AEO emphasizes inclusive sizing, body positivity (especially Aerie's #AerieREAL campaign), and sustainability initiatives like AE Denim's recycled materials.

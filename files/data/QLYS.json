In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Foster City, California, Qualys offers the Qualys Cloud Platform, which delivers asset discovery, vulnerability management, continuous threat protection, compliance monitoring, and cloud security posture management (CSPM) through a SaaS model. The platform processes over 15 billion assets daily across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments, enabling enterprises to detect, prioritize, and remediate threats at scale without agents in many cases.\n\nQualys serves over 10,000 customers worldwide, including 45% of the Forbes Global 2000, focusing on vulnerability management (VM), exposure management, and patch management. Revenue is predominantly recurring via annual subscriptions (97% of total), with annual recurring revenue (ARR) as a key metric.

Social chatter (StockTwits/Reddit) focuses on steady cash flow amid CRWD outage concerns.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold) – Solid fundamentals and profitability support stability, but growth lags hyper-scalers (10% ARR vs. 20%+ peers). Moderate risk from valuation compression in slowdown.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $165 (18% upside) – DCF-based (10% ARR growth, 25x forward EV/ARR terminal) for growth-oriented portfolio.

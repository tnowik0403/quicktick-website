Quantitative metrics limited to Q2 2024 earnings (August 6, 2024 release, <6 months old).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nDana Incorporated (NYSE: DAN) is a leading global provider of high-technology power-concentration and energy-management solutions for vehicles and machines that operate in demanding on- and off-highway applications. Founded in 1904 and headquartered in Maumee, Ohio, the company designs, manufactures, and supplies axles, driveshafts, transmissions, electric vehicle (EV) propulsion systems, thermal-management products, sealing solutions, and fluid-power technologies. Dana serves three primary markets: commercial vehicle (on-highway trucks ~40% of sales), passenger vehicle (~35%), and off-highway (ag/off-road ~25%). With ~43,000 employees across 29 countries, Dana generated $10.6B in trailing 12-month revenue (TTM as of Q2 2024). The company is pivoting toward electrification, with ~20% of 2023 bookings from electrified programs, amid a $60B+ addressable market for e-Drives and thermal systems by 2030. Key strengths include engineering expertise (3,000+ engineers), vertical integration, and a 40%+ North American commercial axle market position. Challenges include cyclical auto exposure and EV transition costs, but Dana's focus on profitable niches like heavy-duty trucks positions it for mid-single-digit growth.

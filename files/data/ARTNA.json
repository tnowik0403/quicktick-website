It serves approximately 186,000 customers across Delaware (its primary market), Maryland, and Pennsylvania, covering roughly 75% of Delaware's population through a network of over 1,360 miles of water mains and 117 wastewater collection systems. The company operates as a regulated utility under the Delaware Public Service Commission (PSC), Maryland Public Service Commission, and Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, ensuring stable revenue through rate cases and approved rate structures.\n\nARTNA's core business focuses on treating and distributing potable water sourced from 11 groundwater aquifers and surface water, while also providing regulated wastewater collection and treatment services. It emphasizes infrastructure reliability, environmental compliance (e.g., PFAS mitigation), and customer growth in suburban and commercial areas. The company generates revenue primarily from water distribution (80-85% of total), with wastewater contributing the balance. ARTNA maintains a strong balance sheet, consistent dividend growth (51 years as of 2024), and invests heavily in capital projects like pipeline replacements and treatment upgrades to support long-term resilience amid climate and regulatory pressures. With a market cap of $407.2 million and current stock price of $40.22 (as of October 10, 2024, close per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq), it trades at a premium to peers due to its regional monopoly-like position but faces valuation scrutiny amid rising interest rates.

(LPLA) is a leading independent wealth management platform in the U.S., primarily operating through its subsidiary LPL Financial LLC, one of the largest broker-dealers1 and registered investment advisors (RIAs) by gross production and assets under management (AUM). Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Boston, MA (with key operations in San Diego, CA), LPL supports over 29,500 independent financial advisors, institutions, and registered investment advisors by providing custody, clearing, technology, compliance, and business services. As of Q3 2024, LPL custodies $1.47 trillion in total advisory and brokerage assets, serving advisors who operate 11,800+ practices across all 50 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe company's business model emphasizes advisor independence, enabling them to run fee-based advisory practices without proprietary product mandates. Revenue is generated via recurring fees (asset-based, advisory, and service fees ~70%), transactional commissions (~20%), and cash sweep interest (~10%). LPL differentiates through scalable technology (e.g., ClientWorks CRM, Advisor Workstation), robust recruiting (1,400+ net new advisors YTD 2024), and a focus on transitioning advisors from wirehouses to independence. In a fragmented $100T+ U.S. wealth management market shifting toward RIAs (projected 12% CAGR through 2028 per Cerulli Associates), LPL captures share via organic growth and M&A, posting 20%+ CAGR in core assets over five years.

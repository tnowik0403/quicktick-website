Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Xerox designs, develops, and sells print systems, software, and services for enterprises, SMBs, and production print environments. Its portfolio spans office multifunction printers (MFPs), high-volume production presses, digital workflow software, and managed print services (MPS). Historically iconic for inventing the photocopier in 1959, Xerox has pivoted toward digital transformation, integrating AI-driven automation, cloud services, and security features amid declining physical print volumes.\n\nThe company operates through two main segments: Global Print Solutions (core revenue driver at ~90%, including equipment sales, consumables, and post-sale services) and Xerox Business Solutions (IT services and financing). In 2023, Xerox generated $6.9 billion in revenue, with ~55% recurring from services and supplies. It serves over 150 countries, focusing on regulated industries like government, healthcare, finance, and graphic arts. Facing secular print declines, Xerox is executing a separation into two entities: Document Technology (print-focused) and IT Services (software/services), announced May 20, 2024, to unlock value. This positions Xerox as a turnaround story in a consolidating $200B+ global print/digital workplace market, emphasizing higher-margin software/services amid AI and hybrid work trends.

Limited growth upside (1-2% CAGR) amid print seculars; separation offers modest catalyst, but execution risks and low multiples reflect stagnation. Dividend supports income, but not for strong growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $14.50 (28% upside from $11.30). DCF-based (8% WACC, 1.5% terminal growth), factoring split value unlock ($8 print + $6.50 IT Services stubs). Moderate risk: volatility from split timeline, balanced by cash flow.",

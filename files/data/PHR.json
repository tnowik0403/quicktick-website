(PHR) is a leading cloud-based SaaS provider of patient activation and engagement solutions for healthcare providers across the U.S. Founded in 2005 and headquartered in New York City, the company streamlines the patient intake process through its proprietary platform, which digitizes check-ins, collects patient data, facilitates payments, communicates clinical information, and ensures HIPAA-compliant workflows. Phreesia serves over 3,500 clients, including multi-specialty groups, single-specialty practices, health systems, and urgent care centers, processing more than 100 million intake transactions annually. Its solutions integrate seamlessly with electronic health records (EHRs) like Epic, Cerner, and athenahealth, driving efficiency in revenue cycle management (RCM) and patient experience.\n\nThe platform's core value lies in accelerating front-end revenue capture (e.g., co-pays, deductibles) and reducing administrative burdens amid rising healthcare consumerism. Phreesia's revenue model is predominantly subscription-based (82% of total revenue), supplemented by network solutions (patient payments, advertising). In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it achieved 21% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth to $369.7 million, with live healthcare providers up 13% to 3,492.

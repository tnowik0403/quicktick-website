(PRTH) is a fintech company specializing in end-to-end payment solutions, merchant acquiring, and integrated SaaS platforms tailored for small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), enterprise clients, and government entities. Headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, PRTH operates through three core segments: SMB (40% of revenue), Enterprise (35%), and Government Services (25%). Its flagship offerings include the Thrive payment platform, which provides gateway services, POS hardware, and value-added services like loyalty programs and analytics. PRTH processes over $100 billion in annual payment volume across 2,700+ enterprise merchants and 150,000+ SMB locations, leveraging proprietary technology for seamless integration with third-party software (e.g., QuickBooks, Microsoft Dynamics).\n\nFounded in 2017 and public since 2021 via SPAC merger, PRTH has pivoted from legacy processing to modern, API-driven solutions amid fintech disruption.

(EXP) is a Fort Worth, Texas-based manufacturer and distributor of high-quality construction materials essential to U.S. infrastructure and building projects. Operating through two main segments—Building Products (73% of FY2024 revenue) and Heavy Materials (27%)—the company produces gypsum wallboard (Sheetrock alternatives), paperboard for recycled gypsum facings, cement, concrete, and aggregates. With 12 wallboard plants, 5 paperboard mills, 8 cement plants/terminals, and 50+ aggregates/concrete sites primarily in the Southwest, Mid-South, and Northern U.S., Eagle serves residential, commercial, industrial, public, and infrastructure markets. Founded in 1963 (as a spun-off entity from Centex), it has grown via organic expansions and bolt-on M&A, emphasizing low-cost production, geographic density, and sustainability (e.g., low-carbon cement initiatives). In FY2024 (ended Mar 31, 2024), revenue hit $2.26B with net earnings of $370.0M. Eagle benefits from infrastructure tailwinds like the IIJA ($1.2T federal funding) but faces cyclical housing/construction risks. Recent expansions position it for 8-10% annual EBITDA growth through FY2027, targeting premium markets with ~15-20% ROIC.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 23, 2024**: Q1 FY2025 earnings beat estimates; Heavy Materials revenue +35% YoY on cement pricing/volume; Building Products +22% on wallboard demand.\n- **Nov 2024**: Announced $100M+ wallboard capacity expansion at Colorado Springs plant (online H2 2025), adding 20-25 Mcf/month.\n- **Sep 2024**: Completed acquisition of TXI assets integration; stock hit 52-week high $301 post-earnings momentum.\n- **Ongoing (Q4 2024)**: Discussions on X/StockTwits highlight wallboard pricing strength (+10-15% YoY) amid low inventory; analysts (e.g., Raymond James upgrade to Outperform Nov 2024) cite infra spending.\n- **Dec 2024 articles (Seeking Alpha, Barron's)**: Positive on Texas/Dallas housing rebound; concerns over cement oversupply in South.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Capacity Expansion**: $300M+ capex FY2025-2026 for wallboard (3 plants), cement (Laramie, WY terminal), aggregates; targets 10% volume growth.\n- **Pricing Discipline**: Annual 5-10% hikes in wallboard/cement; focus on high-margin markets (Texas 40% of capacity).\n- **Sustainability**: Low-alkali cement, recycled content paperboard; pilots carbon capture at Laramie plant (2025).\n- **M&A Pipeline**: $500M dry powder for tuck-ins; CEO Michael Haack (earnings call Oct 23) emphasized \"disciplined bolt-ons\" in Sunbelt aggregates.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company** | Strong balance sheet (Net Debt/EBITDA 1.2x); pricing power (wallboard +12% YoY Q1); IIJA-funded projects. | Regional exposure to softening single-family housing (-5% starts YoY Nov 2024). |\n| **Sector (Construction Materials)** | IIJA/IRA ($1.5T infra/CHIPS); housing shortage (4M units); multi-family/commercial rebound (starts +10% YoY). | High interest rates (Fed cuts Dec 2024 insufficient); cement imports (+20% YTD); labor shortages. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Building Products**: Gypsum wallboard (1.9B sq ft capacity), recycled paperboard (1.4M tons/year).\n- **Heavy Materials**: Portland cement (9.5M tons capacity), concrete/aggregates (Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Wallboard Expansions**: Albuquerque, NM (+30 Mcf/month, Q1 2025); Colorado Springs (+20 Mcf, H2 2025).\n- **Cement**: Laramie, WY plant optimizations (full ramp H1 2025, +10% output); low-carbon Type IL cement pilots.\n- **Aggregates**: New Texas sites (2025 permitting); EV battery material aggregates exploration (early stage).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Wallboard**: ~18-20% U.S. (leader behind USG/Knauf; source: company filings, Freedonia Group 2024).\n- **Cement**: ~8-10% U.S. (regional; #4 behind Cemex, Heidelberg, Holcim; USGS 2024 data).\n- **Aggregates/Concrete**: <5% national, 20-30% in-core markets (Texas/Oklahoma).\n- **Forecast**: +1-2% annual share gain through 2027 via expansions (vs. flat peers); wallboard to 22% with low industry capacity additions (Seeking Alpha consensus Dec 2024).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (FY2024/TTM) | EXP | MLM (Martin Marietta) | VMC (Vulcan) | SUM (Summit) |\n|---------------------|-----|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Market Cap | $8.5B | $36B | $37B | $15B |\n| Revenue Growth (YoY) | +5% | +3% | +5% | +12% (M&A) |\n| EBITDA Margin | 32% | 28% | 26% | 24% |\n| EV/EBITDA | 11.5x | 15x | 14x | 13x |\n| ROIC | 18% | 12% | 11% | 9% |\n| **Edge** | Highest margins; pure-play focus | Scale in aggregates | Southeast strength | M&A aggression |\n\n*EXP trades at discount to peers on growth (analyst est. 12% EPS CAGR vs. 8-10%).*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Ternium (steel for wallboard facings); logistics with BNSF Rail; DoD supplier for military bases.\n- **Recent M&A**: Jul 2024 - Acquired Central Texas concrete plants ($150M); May 2024 - Asphalt terminals in OK/TX.

Rationale: Premium pricing/margins sustain 12-15% EPS growth amid infra tailwinds; undervalued vs. peers (30% upside to $325 fair value); resilient Q1 beat despite macro. Hold if risk-averse; avoid if rates rise.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $325 (DCF-based: 11x FY2026E EBITDA $950M + 2% term prem.; aligns with Raymond James/BofA PTs Dec 2024). Implies 29% upside from $252.34; strong growth portfolio fit (target 15%+ IRR over 2Y).",

Formed as a spin-off from Elanco Animal Health, Orion focuses on sustainable alternatives to antibiotics in animal feed, serving livestock (poultry, swine, ruminants), companion animals (pets), and aquaculture markets. Its portfolio emphasizes organic acids, phytogenics, probiotics, and enzymes to enhance animal performance, gut health, and immunity while addressing regulatory pressures on antibiotic use (e.g., EU bans).  \n\nWith ~1,700 employees and €1.2 billion in trailing 12-month revenue (per Q2 2024 filings), Orion operates through two segments: Animal Nutrition (90%+ revenue) and Contract Manufacturing. It holds strong positions in premixes and specialty feed additives, driven by megatrends like protein demand growth (projected +14% CAGR to 2030 per FAO) and sustainability. Post-IPO on NYSE (July 17, 2024, at $26/share raising $240M), Orion is pursuing deleveraging and bolt-on M&A to fuel 5-7% organic growth amid a fragmented $50B+ global animal nutrition market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **IPO and Spin-Off (July 17, 2024):** Completed NYSE debut post-Elanco spin-off; initial trading saw volatility but stabilized.

Founded in 2015 as a spin-off from WestRock, the company operates in two primary segments: Performance Materials (~70% of revenue) and Performance Chemicals (~30%). Performance Materials produces activated carbon technologies for air and water purification, including products like Nuchar and HydroDarwin for municipal water treatment and industrial vapor adsorption. Performance Chemicals focuses on pine-based chemistics for pavement (e.g., Indulin asphalt modifiers), rubber compounding, and oil & gas applications (e.g., PetroGreen tall oil fatty acids). With ~1,900 employees across 7 manufacturing sites in the US, Canada, Germany, and China, Ingevity serves industrial, automotive, and environmental markets. In 2023, it generated $1.46B in revenue, emphasizing sustainable solutions amid global decarbonization trends. Recent strategic shifts include a pivot toward high-margin activated carbon growth and divestitures of low-margin assets, positioning it in the $10B+ global activated carbon market and $20B+ pavement additives sector. Challenges include raw material volatility (pine markets) and activist pressure, but tailwinds from ESG-driven demand for purification tech support long-term resilience.\n\n## Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of Oct 10, 2024 Close)\n| Metric              | Value          | Source                  |\n|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Stock Price        | $43.72        | Yahoo Finance / Google Finance |\n| Market Cap         | $1.57B        | Yahoo Finance           |\n| 52-Week High/Low   | $51.54 / $35.53 | Yahoo Finance        |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM)    | 15.2          | Yahoo Finance           |\n| EV/EBITDA          | 9.8           | Yahoo Finance           |\n\n## Recent Developments (Chronological, Key Events <6 Months)\n- **Aug 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 Earnings – Net sales $400.2M (down 15% YoY due to Performance Chemicals weakness); Adjusted EBITDA $75.1M (18.8% margin, down from 25.4%); EPS $1.12 (beat estimates).

Attractive valuation (9.8x EV/EBITDA vs. peers 11-12x), carbon tailwinds, and buybacks offset near-term chemicals weakness/activist risks. Strong growth upside in purification (10%+ segment CAGR) suits moderate risk; proxy outcome (Oct 24) key catalyst.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: **$55** (25% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, carbon-driven 5% revenue CAGR); aligns with peer avg 11x EBITDA on $275M 2025E (~$1.6B mcap). Entry below $45 ideal.",

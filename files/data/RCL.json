The company also owns a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). Together, their Global Brands and Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 68 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 166,900 berths as of December 31, 2024. Their ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. \n\nThe mission statement of Royal Caribbean Cruises is to deliver extraordinary vacations, create memories, and promote happiness through their innovative ships, passionate crew members, and unique destinations. The primary source of revenue for Royal Caribbean Cruises is the sale of cruise fares, which include the cost of accommodation, meals, and entertainment during the cruise. The company offers a wide range of cruise options, catering to different budgets and preferences, from short weekend getaways to extended luxury voyages. In addition to cruise fares, Royal Caribbean generates significant revenue from onboard spending through specialty dining experiences, spa treatments, casino gambling, premium beverage packages, and shore excursions.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\nRoyal Caribbean operates 28 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 105,400 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, Royal Caribbean had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,900 berths. Celebrity Cruises is positioned within the premium segment of the vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises' strategy is to target consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, excellent food and drink, elevated hospitality, world-class spaces and accommodations, and live entertainment. For Silversea, Silver Nova is amongst their most environmentally friendly and energy efficient ships to date.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's website serves as a primary channel for direct bookings, allowing customers to plan and reserve their cruises conveniently. In 2024, direct bookings accounted for approximately 40% of the total sales volume, representing $3.5 billion or 27% of total passenger ticket revenue.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### New Ships in Pipeline\nThe ships on order include the second Icon-class ship, Star of the Seas, the third Icon-class ship, and the seventh Oasis-class ship, which are expected to be delivered in 2025, 2026, and 2028, respectively. In addition, during 2024, the company entered into an agreement with Meyer Turku Oy to build a fourth Icon-class ship for delivery in 2027. In August 2024 an order for a fourth ship to be delivered in 2027 was announced and options for two additional ships. In September 2025, Royal Caribbean announced an order for a fifth Icon Class ship, scheduled for delivery in 2028.\n\n### Icon Class Expansion\nThe launch of the Icon of the Seas in early 2024 and the Star of the Seas in August 2025 has redefined the \"vacation of the future.\" The newest Icon Class super-sequel Star of the Seas℠ has it all — so everyone in your crew can show \"either-or\" the door and have the time of their life. It's mindblowing thrills, next level chill, bolder bonding, epic celebrations and wanderlusting exploration — all rolled into one weeklong getaway that's about to go down in history as The World's Best Family Vacation.\n\n### New Destinations & Beach Clubs\nRoyal Beach Club Santorini: Announced for 2026, this represents the next phase of RCL's land-based expansion, aiming to replicate the high-margin success of CocoCay in the Mediterranean. Two beach clubs will open in 2026, starting with Royal Beach Club Santorini in the summer. Royal Caribbean will open up its third Royal Beach Club at the end of 2026 in Cozumel, Mexico. The cruise line purchased Playa Mia and will essentially raze the property and then rebuild it back up as a completely new offering. Just like the other beach clubs, this will be open to just Royal Caribbean cruise passengers and come with an extra cost.\n\n### River Cruises\nThe introduction of Celebrity River Cruises in 2027 is expected to unlock new growth opportunities.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nRoyal Caribbean has positioned itself not merely as a cruise operator, but as a premier global vacation brand competing directly with land-based resorts and theme parks. Royal Caribbean has concentrated on two key areas in which it thinks it can excel and stay ahead of its competition. Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean expects to build on the past success of its Labadee and Coco Cay exclusive destination resorts by adding several more locations between now and 2028.\n\nThe Group is expanding its portfolio of private destinations from three to eight by 2028 through its Perfect Day and Royal Beach Club collections and the company will enter river cruising in 2027 with Celebrity River Cruises. \"Our strong booked position allows us to optimize our yield profile and drive margin expansion and strong financial returns,\" said Naftali Holtz, Chief Financial Officer, Royal Caribbean Group. \"Our formula for success - moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, and strong cost discipline - is expected to deliver 23% adjusted earnings growth in 2025.\"\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nRoyal Caribbean collaborates with travel agencies worldwide to enhance its market reach. In 2024, commissions paid to travel agencies amounted to $1.76 billion, which constitutes about 13.8% of total revenues. The company maintains partnerships with over 20,000 travel agents. The company targets diverse customer segments including families, couples, millennials, and luxury travelers through its differentiated brand portfolio.\n\nCruises are also attracting more first-time passengers. During its first-quarter earnings call, Carnival Cruise Line noted there was a healthy mix of \"new-to-cruise\" in its 2025 bookings to date, with the customer group increasing by over 30% versus a year ago.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results (2024)\nRoyal Caribbean Group today reported 2024 Earnings per Share (\"EPS\") of $10.94 and Adjusted EPS of $11.80. Total revenue for the year reached $16.5 billion. Net Yield Growth: 11.6% for the full year 2024. Operating Cash Flow: Over $5 billion in 2024. For the full year 2024, Royal Caribbean reported a Net Income of $2.9 billion, with an Adjusted Net Income of $3.2 billion. The Adjusted EBITDA was $6.0 billion, indicating strong operational performance.\n\n### 2025 Outlook\nThe strong demand for the company's vacation experiences continues to accelerate into 2025 with Adjusted EPS expected to be in the range of $14.35 to $14.65 per share. The guidance range includes a headwind of $0.65 related to foreign exchange and fuel rates. Bookings have accelerated since the last earnings call, resulting in the best five booking weeks in the company's history. Booked load factors continue to be in line with prior years, and at higher rates. Guest spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases continue to exceed prior years driven by greater participation at higher prices.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- Load factors are at record rates. In an industry that defines a full ship as two people in every cabin, Royal Caribbean reported 112% occupancy in the third quarter of 2025.\n- \"We estimate that 85%+ of tickets have been booked for 2024, and the focus is turning to 2025, with bookings to date already ahead of historical levels,\" Boss said.\n- CLIA member lines will welcome 11 new ships to the global fleet in 2025; 56 new CLIA member ocean-going ships are on order from 2025-2036, representing a $56.8 billion investment and proof of the confidence in cruising's future.\n\n### Headwinds\n- Despite that prediction, high debt levels and the economy remain serious concerns. Also, despite a lower valuation, it may lose ground to Viking among investors since Viking appears to have a stronger business model.\n- While Royal Caribbean's demand backdrop remains healthy, it acknowledged several near-term headwinds that could temper performance. In the third quarter of 2025, net cruise costs excluding fuel rose 4.3%, reflecting higher operating expenses and ongoing investments in new destinations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe Cruise Market Watch recognizes top four cruise companies with the largest market shares in 2025: Carnival Corporation with 41.5 percent of global passenger volume and 36 percent of industry revenue; Royal Caribbean Group with 27 percent of passengers and 24.8 percent of global revenue.

Comparison to Competitors\n\nRCL operates in an oligopoly alongside Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE: CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH). A handful of U.S.-based players dominate today's global cruise market, namely Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise Line. Although Royal Caribbean Cruises operates some of the largest cruise ships worldwide, the brand's main competitor Carnival Corporation remains the leading global cruise company based on revenue.\n\nRoyal Caribbean holds 24.8% of the total revenue, and Norwegian takes third place with a 14.1% revenue share.

(RCL), operating as Royal Caribbean Group, is one of the world's largest cruise vacation companies. Headquartered in Miami, Florida, it owns and operates three primary global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International (mass-market family-focused cruises), Celebrity Cruises (premium upscale experiences), and Silversea Cruises (ultra-luxury all-inclusive expeditions). The company sails 65 ships to over 1,000 destinations across more than 100 countries and territories, serving approximately 7 million passengers annually pre-pandemic levels, with capacity now exceeding that. RCL emphasizes innovative ship designs, private destinations, and experiential entertainment like water parks, ice shows, and surf simulators to attract multigenerational families, millennials, and luxury seekers.\n\nFounded in 1968, RCL has grown through organic fleet expansion and strategic acquisitions, including the $1B purchase of Silversea in 2018 and a 2021 joint venture for a cruise port in Barcelona. Post-COVID recovery has been robust, with 2024 yields up double-digits due to premiumization—shifting toward higher-spend guests via itineraries, onboard spending, and loyalty programs. Revenue is diversified: ~80% from ticket sales, ~20% from onboard (casinos, excursions, retail). RCL invests heavily in sustainability (e.g., LNG-powered ships) and technology (digital booking, AI personalization). As of Q2 2024, the company achieved record bookings, with 75% of 2025 capacity sold at higher prices, positioning it for sustained growth amid pent-up travel demand.

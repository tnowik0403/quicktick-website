(TXT) is a diversified multi-industry conglomerate headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, with approximately 35,000 employees worldwide. Founded in 1923, it operates through five primary segments: Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial, and Finance. The company generates the majority of its revenue from aviation and defense, which accounted for over 80% of 2023 revenues.\n\nTextron Aviation designs, manufactures, and services business jets (e.g., Citation series), turboprops (e.g., Beechcraft Denali), and piston aircraft (e.g., Cessna Skyhawk), alongside military trainers like the T-7A Red Hawk. It holds a strong position in the light and midsize business jet markets. Bell, a helicopter pioneer since 1935, produces commercial and military rotorcraft such as the Bell 407, 505, UH-1Y, and AH-1Z, and is a key partner in the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor program. It is also developing the V-280 Valor for the U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program. Textron Systems focuses on defense technologies including unmanned systems (e.g., Shadow drone), precision weapons, and marine vessels. The Industrial segment provides specialized vehicles (e.g., Arctic Cat snowmobiles, Cushman utility vehicles) and fasteners/tools via Textron Fastening Systems. Finance offers financing for Textron products.\n\nIn 2023, Textron reported total revenues of $13.7 billion, with aviation/defense driving growth amid rising defense budgets and business jet demand recovery post-COVID. The company emphasizes aftermarket services (MRO), which provide high-margin recurring revenue, and invests in electrification and autonomy for future platforms.

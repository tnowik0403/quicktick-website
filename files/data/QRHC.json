Founded in 2008 and publicly traded since 2012, the company operates through two main segments: Infrastructure Services (Collection Services and Reverse Logistics) and Industrial Services (Waste & Recycling Solutions). QRHC collects, processes, and recycles waste streams from industries including oil & gas drilling, refining, manufacturing, automotive, retail, hospitality, and construction. Key offerings include solvent recycling, oil re-refining, wastewater treatment, parts cleaning, and electronics recycling, with a strong emphasis on sustainability—claiming to divert over 90% of processed materials from landfills annually.\n\nThe company serves ~3,000 active customer locations, leveraging a network of 20+ facilities (including 12 solvent recycling plants and 3 oil re-refining sites). In 2023, QRHC processed ~200 million gallons of fluids and recycled ~1.2 billion pounds of materials. Revenue is recurring from long-term contracts (average tenure 5+ years), with a focus on ESG compliance amid tightening regulations. QRHC differentiates via proprietary technologies like closed-loop solvent recovery (up to 99% efficiency) and data-driven sustainability reporting. Challenges include commodity price volatility and industrial slowdowns, but tailwinds from circular economy trends position it for growth.

Growth Strategy\n\nAs we look ahead to the second half, we are well positioned to return to organic net sales growth supported by a robust innovation pipeline, increased merchandising and A&P investment, and a resilient supply chain. Sean Connolly, president and chief executive officer, said Conagra Brands' priorities in fiscal 2026 will be driving growth in frozen food and snacks, improving supply chain resiliency by modernizing facilities, seeking to mitigate the impact of tariffs on its canned business, and producing productivity savings with a focus on cash flow.\n\nHe added that Conagra is \"excited to resume our historical practice of active portfolio reshaping with both inbound and outbound activities.\" In recent years, the company has been more focused on debt paydown, but after improving debt and cash flow, \"we are in a strong position to resume active portfolio reshaping and, importantly, still meet our long-term 3x net leverage target through a combination of bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures of low growth business,\" Connolly explained.\n\nThe company has completed its baked chicken facility and is implementing Project Catalyst to reengineer core business processes using AI for more efficiency.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nConagra operates across multiple channels:\n- **Retail Sales**: Products sold directly to consumers through grocery stores, supermarkets, and online retailers.\n- **Foodservice**: Products supplied to restaurants, hotels, and other foodservice establishments.\n- **Private Label**: Manufacturing products for other brands and retailers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q2 2026 Results (December 19, 2025):**\n- Reported net sales decreased 6.8%; organic net sales decreased 3.0%.\n- Reported operating margin was (20.1)%; adjusted operating margin was 11.3%.\n- Reported diluted loss per share was $1.39, primarily as a result of certain non-cash goodwill and brand impairment charges, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.45. Conagra Brands (CAG) reported its most recent earnings on Dec 19, 2025 for Q2 2026, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $0.45.\n- However, revenue came in at $2.98 billion, just below the expected $2.99 billion.\n\n**Full Year Performance:**\n- In 2025, Conagra Brands's revenue was $11.61 billion, a decrease of -3.64% compared to the previous year's $12.05 billion.\n- Earnings were $1.15 billion, an increase of 231.91%.\n\n**Guidance for Fiscal 2026:**\n- Organic net sales change of (1)% to 1% compared to fiscal 2025 · Adjusted operating margin between ~11.0% and ~11.5%. We continue to expect organic net sales change of -1% to +1% versus fiscal 2025, adjusted operating margin of approximately 11%-11.5%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.85 per share.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Animal protein costs forecast to rise in the 'double digits' in fiscal 2026. He said he expects inflation for core cost of goods to about 4% in the coming fiscal year, which will bring the 5-year cumulative net inflation to about 45% – \"a historic amount of inflation over such a short period of time.\"\n- He said he also expects the current tariff environment to add about 3% to Conagra's cost of good sold, which is more than $200 million annually, which would bring the total anticipated inflation for next year to about 7%.\n- The company's canned food products have \"the largest tariff exposure as steel and aluminum.\" Canned products make up Conagra Brands' greatest tariff exposure.\n- The company has experienced customer service interruptions during the third quarter due to supply constraints on two product platforms: frozen meals containing chicken and frozen vegetables.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Despite these headwinds, the company maintained its leadership in the single-serve meals market with a 52.9% market share and saw strong performance in protein-centric snacks. The company has successfully reclaimed market share in its frozen single-serve meals segment.\n- Conagra Brands, which faced supply challenges in the last fiscal year, has achieved 98% service levels to ensure products are on retail shelves.\n- That's why we're encouraged with fiscal twenty twenty seven because as we get those investments completed and we can be less reliant on the third party manufacturers and we can bring that volume back in house, that absorption is not as much of a headwind anymore and it can actually become a tailwind.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTheir largest market share is in the Snack Food Production industry, where they account for an estimated 10.6% of total industry revenue. In the US, the company has a notable market share in at least five industries: Frozen Food Production, Snack Food Production, Meat Jerky Production, Frozen Cake & Pastry Manufacturing, Meat Alternatives Production.\n\nDespite these headwinds, the company maintained its leadership in the single-serve meals market with a 52.9% market share.\n\n## 10.

Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\n- These included portfolio shaping opportunities such as the acquisition of FATTY Smoked Meat Sticks and the divesture of Chef Boyardee.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 5.8/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nConagra presents a mixed investment profile with moderate growth prospects hampered by significant operational and macro challenges. The company benefits from strong brand recognition, market leadership in key categories, and attractive dividend yield. However, persistent inflation pressures, supply chain disruptions, tariff headwinds, and declining organic sales present substantial headwinds.\n\n**Strengths supporting the rating:**\n- Strong dividend yield of 8.09% providing income support\n- Leadership position in single-serve meals (52.9% market share) and snack foods (10.6% industry share)\n- Successful portfolio modernization and innovation initiatives\n- Improved supply chain performance (98% service levels achieved)\n\n**Concerns limiting the rating:**\n- Significant inflation pressure expected to reach 7% in fiscal 2026\n- Declining organic sales (-3.0% in Q2 2026)\n- Major impairment charges indicating asset overvaluation\n- Tariff exposure particularly in canned goods segment\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $20.50**\n\nBased on current analyst price targets averaging $19.43, the company's dividend sustainability, market leadership positions, and expected operational improvements by fiscal 2027, a fair value of $20.50 represents approximately 17% upside from current levels. This assumes successful execution of supply chain investments, moderate inflation relief, and volume recovery in the frozen and snacks segments.\n\nThe stock appears attractive for income-focused investors given its high dividend yield and defensive consumer staples profile, but growth investors may want to wait for clearer signs of volume recovery and margin expansion.",

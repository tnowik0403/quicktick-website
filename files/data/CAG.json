(CAG) is a leading North American packaged foods company headquartered in Chicago, IL (relocated from Omaha in 2022), with a portfolio of iconic brands spanning grocery, snacks, frozen, and refrigerated categories. The company operates through three main segments: Grocery & Snacks (e.g., Slim Jim, Chef Boyardee, Hunt's), Refrigerated & Frozen (e.g., Marie Callender’s, Birds Eye, Healthy Choice), and International/Foodservice. CAG generates ~90% of revenue from the U.S., serving consumers via retail channels like supermarkets, club stores, and e-commerce. With annual revenues around $12 billion (FY2024), it focuses on value-oriented products amid inflation pressures, leveraging scale for supply chain efficiencies and brand innovation. Recent strategic shifts include divestitures of non-core assets to streamline the portfolio toward higher-margin snacks and frozen entrées, while investing in productivity (targeting $400M+ savings by FY2025) and marketing (e.g., Slim Jim expansions). CAG pays a quarterly dividend (yield ~4.6%) and trades at a forward P/E of ~10x, appealing to income investors but facing volume headwinds from consumer trading down and category softness.

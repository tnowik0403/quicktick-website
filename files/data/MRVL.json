(NASDAQ: MRVL) is a leading fabless semiconductor designer and provider of data infrastructure solutions, powering the world's largest cloud providers, telecom networks, automotive systems, and enterprise storage. Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Marvell specializes in high-performance silicon for AI-driven data centers, 5G/6G networking, Ethernet connectivity, and custom ASICs. Its portfolio spans custom AI accelerators, data processing units (DPUs), optical DSPs, storage controllers, and automotive Ethernet switches.\n\nIn FY2025 (ended Jan 25, 2025), Marvell generated ~$5.5B in revenue, with data center (50%+) as the growth engine amid AI demand. The company shifted from legacy storage/consumer (declining to <20%) to high-margin AI/networking (>60% gross margins). Key differentiators include end-to-end custom silicon for hyperscalers (e.g., Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium) and leadership in 800G/1.6T Ethernet. Marvell's \"AI factories\" strategy targets $2.5B+ AI revenue by FY2027, leveraging 5nm/3nm processes via TSMC partnerships. With 7,000+ employees and a $1B+ R&D spend, Marvell is positioned as a \"picks-and-shovels\" AI enabler, competing with Broadcom but excelling in custom silicon for non-Nvidia ecosystems.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 FY2026 Earnings (Reported Dec 3, 2025)**: Revenue $1.516B (+27% YoY); GAAP EPS $0.19 (beat est. $0.17); Non-GAAP EPS $0.43 (beat $0.41). Data center revenue $1.02B (+90% YoY), AI revenue $1.1B (guidance for Q4: $1.3B+). Gross margin 50.2% non-GAAP. FY2026 revenue guidance raised to $6.3B-$6.5B (+13-17% YoY).

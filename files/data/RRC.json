The company primarily operates in the Appalachian Basin, with its core acreage in the Marcellus Shale formation in Pennsylvania's Northeast Pennsylvania (NEPA) and Southwest Pennsylvania (SWPA) regions. RRC's operations emphasize low-cost, high-return natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production, leveraging one of the industry's premier low-pressure dry gas inventories. As of year-end 2023, RRC reported proved reserves of approximately 18.1 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), with 78% natural gas and 90% located in the Marcellus Shale. The company prioritizes capital discipline, targeting free cash flow (FCF) generation over aggressive growth amid volatile commodity prices. In 2024, RRC has maintained flat production volumes around 2.2-2.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/d) while returning capital via dividends ($0.05/share quarterly) and share repurchases ($123 million YTD through Q2). RRC differentiates through operational excellence, including extended laterals (up to 16,000+ feet), enhanced completions, and low breakeven costs (~$1.80/Mcf in NEPA). It transports ~95% of volumes via firm pipeline capacity to premium markets like the U.S. Northeast, Gulf Coast LNG, and power plants. Recent focus includes emissions reduction (e.g., electrification of drilling rigs) and potential LNG export upside.

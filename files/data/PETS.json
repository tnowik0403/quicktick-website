The company provides a wide range of veterinarian-prescribed and non-prescription medications, health and wellness products, food, and supplies for dogs, cats, and horses, shipped directly to consumers. PETS emphasizes convenience with 24/7 customer service, autoship programs, and competitive pricing, targeting pet owners seeking affordable alternatives to brick-and-mortar vet visits or big-box retailers. In FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024), it generated $298.5 million in revenue, serving over 2 million pets annually via a fully online model with no physical stores. The firm holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and focuses on FDA-approved products, positioning itself in the $30+ billion U.S. pet medication and supply market amid rising pet ownership (70% of U.S. households).

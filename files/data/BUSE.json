The company delivers a full suite of banking, wealth management, and investment services across Illinois, Missouri, Florida, and Indiana. With approximately $32 billion in assets (as of Q2 2024), Busey focuses on retail and commercial banking, emphasizing relationship-driven lending to small- and middle-market businesses, agriculture, real estate, and healthcare sectors. Key offerings include deposit accounts, commercial real estate (CRE) loans (39% of portfolio), commercial and industrial (C&I) loans (32%), and consumer loans, alongside fee-based revenue from wealth management ($4.2B AUM as of Q2 2024) and capital markets. Busey differentiates via its \"community banking\" model, leveraging local expertise in the Midwest and Southeast. Recent strategic shifts post-2023 acquisitions have expanded its footprint into high-growth markets like Florida and St. Louis, boosting non-interest income to 28% of total revenue. Despite regional banking pressures, Busey's conservative risk management (e.g., 95% loans held-for-investment) and deposit beta of 35% position it resiliently amid rate volatility.

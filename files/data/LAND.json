Founded in 2004 and publicly traded since 2013, the company focuses on permanent cropland suitable for high-value, perennial crops such as strawberries, blueberries, pistachios, almonds, and vegetables. LAND leases these properties under long-term net lease agreements (typically 10+ years) to independent third-party farmers, generating stable rental income. As of Q2 2024, the portfolio spans 19 states with approximately 138 farms totaling ~116,000 acres, diversified across crops (e.g., 25% berries, 20% nuts, 15% vegetables) and geographies (heavy in California, Florida, Michigan).\n\nThe business model emphasizes capital recycling: acquiring undervalued farmland, improving it for higher rents, and selling non-core assets to fund growth. LAND targets crops resilient to climate variability and supported by strong consumer demand for fresh produce. With a dividend-focused strategy (monthly payouts yielding ~7.5% as of Oct 2024), it appeals to income investors. However, as a small-cap REIT (~$465M market cap), it faces liquidity and valuation challenges amid rising interest rates. Management, led by CEO Bill Welch since 2020, prioritizes accretive acquisitions amid farmland values appreciating ~5-7% annually per USDA data.

(INSW), headquartered in New York City, is a leading independent tanker company specializing in the global seaborne transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Formed in 2014 as a spin-off from OSG and expanded via the 2021 merger with Diamond S Shipping, INSW operates one of the world's largest fleets of mid-to-large-sized tankers, totaling 81 wholly owned vessels as of June 30, 2024. This includes 11 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), 13 Suezmaxes, 8 Aframaxes, 7 LR2s, 30 Medium Range (MR) product tankers, and 12 LR1s/Handysize. The company generates revenue primarily through time charter equivalent (TCE) contracts, with a mix of spot market exposure (about 60-70% of earnings) via pools like the Scorpio MR Pool and 5Pool, and fixed-rate charters for stability. INSW serves a diverse customer base of oil majors, refiners, and traders, capitalizing on geopolitical disruptions (e.g., Red Sea attacks since October 2023) and supply constraints that have driven tanker rates to multi-year highs. With a focus on fleet modernization, shareholder returns via dividends ($0.12/share quarterly) and buybacks ($100M+ authorized in 2024), and a low net debt of $98.6M (as of Q2 2024), INSW is positioned as a high free-cash-flow generator in a cyclical sector.

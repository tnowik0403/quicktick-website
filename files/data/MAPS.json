(operating as Weedmaps) is a leading technology platform in the U.S. cannabis industry, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Irvine, CA. It connects cannabis consumers with licensed retailers, brands, and products through its flagship Weedmaps consumer app and website, which boasts over 100 million lifetime visits and serves 85% of U.S. cannabis markets. The company offers B2B SaaS solutions via \"Weedmaps for Business,\" including menu management, SEO, advertising, and analytics for dispensaries and brands. With a dual-sided marketplace model, Weedmaps drives foot traffic and e-commerce for retailers while monetizing through listings, ads, and premium features.

As of Q2 2024, it reported 1,050 enterprise clients and processes data from 25,000+ retailers.

Strong moat in fragmented market, cash buffer, legalization catalysts outweigh near-term sector softness. Moderate risk from regulation/volatility.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $1.75 (85% upside).

EBITDA is ‪−232.81 M‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is −321.04%.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe small-to-medium lift launch market is highly competitive. In 2017, SpaceX's global market share reached an impressive 45% of awarded commercial space contracts, making it the top commercial launch provider. Firefly competes in a niche segment:\n\n- **Small Launch Market:** Firefly boasts a big book of business for its current Alpha-class rocket, which with a one-ton payload to low Earth orbit, outclasses Rocket Lab's Electron by a factor of three.\n- **Responsive Launch:** Firefly is the only commercial company to launch a satellite to orbit with approximately 24-hour notice. Firefly is also the only company to achieve a fully successful landing on the Moon.\n- **Lunar Services Market:** First commercial company to successfully land on the Moon, providing competitive advantage in CLPS contracts\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Rocket Lab:**\n- Firefly's $2 billion valuation positions it competitively within the space launch market, though still significantly below industry leader SpaceX, which has reached valuations exceeding $100 billion. For context, Firefly's closest public competitor, Rocket Lab, has a market capitalization of $12.4 billion as of June 2025.\n- Rocket Lab's Q3 2025 revenue of $155 million dwarfs Firefly's entire nine-month total, highlighting the scale gap that Firefly must close to achieve operational efficiency.\n\n**vs. SpaceX:**\n- While SpaceX's Falcon 9 can accommodate medium-sized payloads through rideshare missions, its primary focus is on larger payloads, leaving an opportunity for Firefly Aerospace to serve dedicated medium-lift customers who need specific orbital parameters that rideshare missions can't provide.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- The company's competitive advantages include its vertical integration with many of its components built in-house, reducing supply chain vulnerabilities.\n- Only commercial company with successful lunar landing capability\n- 24-hour responsive launch capability\n\n## 10.

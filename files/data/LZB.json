LZB outperforms on margins/niche dominance but lags in scale.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Financing with Wells Fargo/TD Bank (store-level); fabric suppliers like Spradling (sustainability collab, 2024).\n- **M&A**: Acquired LeatherTech (2018, $23M); no major deals since; monitoring distressed peers (CEO Q1 call).\n- **Major Clients**: Primarily DTC via owned stores (75% sales); key wholesale to Bassett, Rooms To Go (~10% combined); hospitality via Cramco (Marriott pilots, 2024).\n\n## Key Financials from Recent Verified Reports (<6 months)\n**Q1 FY2025 (Ended Jul 27, 2024; 10-Q)**:\n| Metric              | Value       | YoY Change |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Revenue            | $416.5M    | -8.1%     |\n| Gross Profit       | $187.7M    | -7.9%     |\n| Gross Margin       | 45.1%      | +10 bps   |\n| Operating Income   | $42.1M     | -13%      |\n| Net Income         | $28.3M     | -15%      |\n| EPS (diluted)      | $0.67      | -16%      |\n| Cash & Equivalents | $81.2M     | -         |\n\n**Outlook (Mgmt Guidance, Aug 2024)**: FY2025 Retail comps -2% to +2%; EPS $2.85-$3.15.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold with Upside Bias)**  \n  Rationale: Solid fundamentals (high margins, buybacks) and strategic execution offset housing headwinds. Rate cuts (50 bps expected Dec 2024) could catalyze +10-15% housing rebound, driving re-rating. Moderate risk from cyclicality balanced by niche moat. Attractive vs. peers on valuation.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$45.50** (17% upside from $38.92).  \n  DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; aligns with analyst consensus avg target $44.67 per MarketBeat, Oct 2024). Targets strong growth (EPS +10% CAGR FY25-27) for moderate-risk portfolios.",

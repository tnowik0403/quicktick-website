Founded in 1938 and headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, the company operates over 2,200 Tractor Supply stores across 49 states, plus 200+ PetSense Animal Hospital locations and four Del's Feed & Farm Supply stores as of Q2 2024. Its \"Life Out Here\" brand focuses on providing essential products for farming, ranching, pet care, home improvement, and outdoor recreation. Core categories include livestock and animal feeds (e.g., hay, grain), fencing, tools, hardware, clothing, footwear, and pet supplies like food, toys, and health products. TSC generates the majority of its revenue from everyday essentials (60%+ of sales), with a growing emphasis on pet (20%+ of sales) and seasonal/hobby items.\n\nThe company differentiates through a unique store format averaging 15,000-17,000 sq ft, located in rural/suburban areas underserved by big-box retailers. TSC's business model emphasizes high inventory turns, loyal customer base (90% repeat visits), and omnichannel capabilities with buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) comprising 13% of digital sales. In fiscal 2023, TSC reported $14.7B in revenue, serving ~35M customers annually. Strategic pillars include store expansion (targeting 2,450 Tractor Supply stores by 2026), pet market penetration via PetSense, and digital growth (digital sales up 10% YoY in Q2 2024). TSC benefits from a recession-resistant model tied to essential rural spending but faces cyclical pressures from agriculture commodity prices and consumer wallets.

Company Overview\n\nSpectral AI, Inc. is an artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on predictive medical diagnostics in the United States, specifically targeting faster and more accurate treatment decisions in wound care, with initial applications involving patients with burns. The company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and is working to revolutionize the management of wound care by \"Seeing the Unknown®\" with its DeepView System.\n\nThe company offers DeepView System, which uses proprietary AI algorithms to distinguish between fully damaged, partially damaged, and healthy human tissue characteristics invisible to the naked eye at the initial time point of wound presentation, and delivers a binary prediction on the wound's capacity to heal or not heal by a specified time point in the future to assist physicians in making more accurate, timely, and informed decisions regarding treatment. The system also includes MSI imaging technology, which consists of proprietary multi-spectral optics and sensors that capture injured tissue images, and AI-Burn software.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nSpectral AI, Inc. Class A (MDAI) stock is priced at $1.58, giving the company a market capitalization of $49.41 million. The stock has a 52-week high of $3.21 and a 52-week low of $1.04. The stock currently trades at -3.6% below its daily high and carries a negative P/E multiple of -2.16. The company has approximately 30.69 million shares outstanding.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**DeepView System** is Spectral AI's flagship product:\n- A non-invasive, predictive medical device and associated software platform that combines multispectral imaging with a proprietary AI algorithm to assess the healing potential of burn wounds\n- Provides clinicians with a non-healing prediction on the same day of injury and up to a week (7 days) post injury, enabling earlier and more informed treatment decisions\n- The system is non-invasive and cart-based, allowing for exceptional mobility within the healthcare setting\n\n**Performance Data:**\n- At the image-wise level, the DeepView System scored 86.6% while clinical judgment annotation (CJA) of burn physicians scored 40.8%\n- At the pixel-wise level, the DeepView System scored 81.9% and CJA of burn physicians scored 38.8%\n- DeepView significantly improved clinicians' ability to detect non-healing wounds, increasing detection rates from 61% to 89% (p < 0.0001)\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe company plans to continue expansion and development of its DeepView® System, with preparation for commercial readiness in 2026. The financing secured will help develop and expand the DeepView System's clinical indications beyond burns. The progress and adoption of the DeepView system outside the US have resulted in both published studies and operational device improvements, with these learnings incorporated into the forthcoming Phoenix iteration.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe company's growth strategy focuses on:\n- **FDA Approval:** Plans to have the FDA grant the De Novo Classification Request of the DeepView System in early 2026\n- **Commercial Transition:** Management expects 2026 to be generally a down year on revenue as the company enters commercial transition, with 2027-2028 expected to be the main growth years\n- **International Expansion:** CEO Capone reported \"the feedback we've gotten from the units outside the US has been overwhelmingly positive\"\n- **Market Development:** Preparations are underway with a commercialization lead already in place and four additional headcount additions budgeted for 2026\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Government Partnerships:**\n- The DeepView System development is supported with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; BARDA, under contract number 75A50123C00049\n- The Company continues to build on its BARDA PBS contract awarded in September 2023, the largest contract in company history valued at up to $150.0 million, with an initial award of approximately $54.9 million to fund development activities through Q1 2026\n\n**Clinical Institutions:**\n- Notable presentations included studies from the North Bristol NHS Trust, Louisiana State University, and the Royal Victoria Infirmary\n- Dr. James Hwang, burn director at UAB Burn Center in Birmingham, Alabama has provided positive feedback\n- Chris Wearn from Bristol Adult Burns Service shared positive early experiences\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Research and development revenue of $3.8 million, falling significantly short of the analyst estimate of $5.16 million and representing a 54% decline from the $8.2 million reported in the same quarter last year\n- Spectral AI reported a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.13 for the quarter, worse than the analyst estimate for a loss of $0.0842 per share\n- Spectral AI ended the quarter with a cash position of $10.5 million, a significant improvement from $3.7 million a year prior\n\n**2024 Full Year Performance:**\n- In 2024, Spectral AI's revenue was $29.58 million, an increase of 63.83% compared to the previous year's $18.06 million\n- Losses were -$15.32 million, -26.56% less than in 2023\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\n- The company reduced revenue guidance from $21.5 million to $18.5 million for 2025, reflecting BARDA timing and government shutdown effects\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe U.S. wound market was valued at approximately $12.2 billion in 2023, and is projected to grow to around $15.9 billion by 2030. The Advanced Wound Care market is described as large, under-penetrated, and disjointed in terms of care pathways, with MDAI's DeepView having the potential to improve, democratize, and speed up treatment in its initial target markets. As a pre-commercialization company, Spectral AI currently has minimal market share but is positioning for entry upon FDA approval.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nSimilar companies in the medical devices industry include Accuray Incorporated (ARAY), Pulmonx Corporation (LUNG), Myomo, Inc. (MYO), Vicarious Surgical Inc. (RBOT), and others. The De Novo regulatory pathway is being pursued due to the novel nature of this technology, which does not have a predicate device currently available in the U.S. market, suggesting Spectral AI has first-mover advantage in AI-powered burn wound assessment.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Government Partnerships:**\n- Since 2013 and prior to the current contract, the advance development has been supported in two previous contract awards under contract numbers 75A50119C00033 and HHSO100201300022C\n- The BARDA contract, once FDA clearance is obtained, includes clauses to help begin the placement of devices in burn centers and beyond\n\n**Corporate Transactions:**\n- In November 2024, the company announced its intention to spin off Spectral IP into an independent, publicly-traded company, with completion anticipated by the end of Q2 2025\n\n**Financial Partners:**\n- Northland Capital Markets acted as the exclusive placement agent for the October 2025 $7.6 million funding round\n\n## 11.

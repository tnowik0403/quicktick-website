As of Q3 2024, the portfolio comprises ~16,200 multifamily units across 50 communities and ~2.0 million square feet of retail space in 23 centers, totaling 90%+ leased occupancy. The company's strategy emphasizes premium multifamily assets in walkable, transit-oriented suburbs proximate to employment hubs like government, defense, and tech corridors (e.g., near Amazon HQ2). Retail assets target grocery-anchored centers with resilient tenants like Safeway and CVS. Elme benefits from the DC area's demographic stability, low supply growth (multifamily deliveries <1% of inventory in 2024), and strong job market (unemployment ~3%). Recent rebranding from Washington REIT underscores a shift to multifamily dominance (79% of NOI in Q3 2024). With a forward dividend yield of ~3.8% ($0.60 annualized), Elme appeals to income-focused investors amid sector-wide interest rate pressures. Management targets 4-5% annual same-store NOI growth through operational efficiencies and development.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released Oct 30, 2024)**: Total revenues $64.8 million (up 3.2% YoY); Net income $5.2 million; Core FFO $0.35/share (beat consensus $0.34); Same-store multifamily NOI +5.1% YoY; Retail NOI flat.

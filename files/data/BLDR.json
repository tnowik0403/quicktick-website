(NYSE: BLDR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $178.42 |\n| Market Capitalization | $21.62 billion |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $214.55 / $135.60 |\n| Avg. Daily Volume (10-day) | 1.28 million shares |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | 15.2 |\n| Forward P/E | 13.8 |\n\n**Company Overview** (248 words)  \nBuilders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR) is the nation's largest supplier of structural building products, value-added components, and construction services to the U.S. residential construction market, including new single-family homes, multi-family projects, and repair/remodel (R&R) segments. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company operates approximately 570 locations across 42 states, serving professional homebuilders, multi-family developers, and remodelers. Its product portfolio includes factory-built roof and wall systems, structural framing (e.g., engineered wood products like trusses and I-joists), windows, doors, siding, and gypsum wallboard, complemented by services such as professional installation, turnkey framing, and shell construction.  \n\nBLDR's vertically integrated model—owning 65 truss manufacturing facilities and 90+ millwork plants—differentiates it from peers, enabling cost efficiencies and customized solutions. In 2023, it generated $17.1 billion in revenue (per 2023 10-K), with ~75% from new residential construction. The company benefits from the U.S. housing shortage (estimated 4-7 million unit deficit per Freddie Mac, June 2024), but faces cyclical pressures from interest rates and affordability. Strategically, BLDR pursues M&A for market consolidation (e.g., 11 bolt-ons in 2023), digital tools like myBLDR portal for ordering, and expansion into multi-family and R&R amid single-family slowdowns. With a 10%+ share in key structural products, BLDR is positioned for recovery as housing starts rebound.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 1, 2024; sourced from BLDR IR and Seeking Alpha transcript):** Revenue $4.95 billion (+0.4% YoY); Net income $172 million (GAAP EPS $1.40); Adjusted EBITDA $572 million (11.6% margin, +10 bps YoY).

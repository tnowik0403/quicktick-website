Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Tenet focuses on delivering high-acuity inpatient care via 60 hospitals (including short-stay surgical hospitals) across 15 states, serving approximately 1 million patients annually. USPI, the fastest-growing segment, operates over 530 ASCs and 370 physician practices/clinics nationwide, performing more than 2 million procedures yearly. This dual-segment model capitalizes on the shift from expensive inpatient hospital stays to cost-effective outpatient settings. In FY2023, THC generated $20.5 billion in revenue, with Ambulatory Care contributing ~45% and growing rapidly. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, clinical quality (top decile CMS ratings), and strategic partnerships to expand in high-margin outpatient services amid rising demand from an aging population and payer preferences for lower-cost care. Recent divestitures (e.g., selling 5 hospitals in California on June 1, 2023) have streamlined its portfolio toward ambulatory dominance.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 24, 2024)**: Revenue $5.05B (+5.2% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $965M (+9.1% YoY); Adjusted EPS $2.31 (beat estimates by $0.44).

Rationale: USPI's 15%+ growth outpaces sector (5-7%); undervalued vs. peers; FY2024 beats likely. Moderate risk from macro/reimbursement offset by cash flow ($2B+ FCF est.).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $210 (20% upside). Based on 11x 2025E EBITDA ($3.8B projected, 12% growth); DCF with 10% WACC, 5% terminal growth. Strong growth upside from ambulatory (target 55% revenue mix by 2026).",

SaaS momentum, AI catalysts, and 20% undervaluation vs. peers support 25-30% upside in 12-18 months amid regulatory tailwinds. Moderate risk from print decline offset by $412M ARR stability.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $85/share (25% upside from $68.50). DCF-based (8% ARR CAGR, 36% margins, 10x EV/ARR terminal); implies $5.2B market cap. Entry below $70 ideal for moderate risk portfolio targeting 15%+ annualized returns.

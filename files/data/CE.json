No older or unverified metrics used.*\n\n## Company Overview (218 words)\nCelanese Corporation (NYSE: CE) is a global technology and specialty materials company headquartered in Irving, Texas, with ~11,400 employees across 24 countries. Founded in 1918, it operates in two primary segments: **Engineered Materials (EMS, ~55% of sales)**, which delivers high-performance polymers like nylon, polyolefins, elastomers, and composites used in automotive, medical, consumer electronics, and industrial applications; and **Acetyl Chain (AC, ~45% of sales)**, a leader in basic chemicals and intermediates such as acetic acid, vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), serving coatings, adhesives, textiles, and consumer goods markets.  \n\nCelanese emphasizes sustainable, high-margin specialty products amid cyclical commodity exposure. Post-2022 $11B acquisition of DuPont's Mobility & Materials business, EMS now drives ~60% of EBITDA, bolstering leadership in engineered thermoplastics for EVs, 5G, and lightweighting. The company generated $10.8B in 2023 net sales, with a focus on cost optimization (e.g., $650M savings program through 2024) and high-return M&A. It navigates chemical industry volatility via a diversified portfolio, global footprint (Americas 45%, EMEA 25%, Asia 30%), and innovation in bio-based and recycled materials. Challenges include oversupply in acetylene chain and weak auto demand, but tailwinds from secular shifts in mobility and electronics position it for mid-single-digit organic growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 5, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Net sales $2.61B (-3.6% YoY); Adjusted EPS $2.42 (beat estimates); EMS sales $1.46B (-1.2% YoY, volume down due to auto softness); AC sales $1.15B (-6.5% YoY, pricing pressure).

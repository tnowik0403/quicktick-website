Acquired Great Valley Bank assets in 2021.\n- **Major Clients**: SMBs in hospitality (Poconos resorts), healthcare (Lehigh Valley Health Network affiliates), education (ESU). Top 10 loans <20% portfolio.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Community reinvestment strong (CRA rating \"Outstanding,\" 2023 FDIC).\n- **Management**: CEO tenure 20+ years; aligned incentives (40% insider ownership).\n- **Risks**: High CRE concentration; liquidity HQLA ratio 120% (adequate).\n- **Sentiment**: Positive local press (Pocono Record, Sept 2024 branch opening); thin analyst coverage (Raymond James \"Market Perform\").\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold). Attractive valuation (0.85x TBV vs. peer 1.1x), dividend, M&A potential offset by NPLs and slow growth. Suitable for moderate risk, but limited upside vs. larger PA banks.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $13.50 (32% upside). Based on 10x 2025E EPS ($1.25, per Q2 guidance + consensus), 1.0x TBV target. Growth upside from rate relief/M&A; hold for 12-18 months.",

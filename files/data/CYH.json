(CYH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $9.74\n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.30 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $2.00 - $12.44\n- **Avg.

(CYH) is a leading for-profit operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities across the United States. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, CYH manages a network of 71 hospitals with approximately 11,000 licensed beds in 15 states, primarily concentrated in non-urban markets in the Sunbelt region (e.g., Florida, Texas, North Carolina). The company provides a comprehensive range of inpatient and outpatient services, including emergency care, general and specialty surgery, critical care, cardiology, orthopedics, neurology, and obstetrics. Outpatient services are delivered through over 50 urgent care centers, freestanding emergency departments (EDs), and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs).\n\nCYH generates revenue primarily from patient services (∼96% from net patient revenues), with Medicare (∼32%), Medicaid (∼19%), and managed care/commercial payers (∼45%) as key sources. In recent years, CYH has undergone significant portfolio optimization, divesting over 40 hospitals since 2019 to reduce debt and focus on higher-performing assets. This has shifted its footprint toward higher-growth markets amid challenges like labor shortages and reimbursement pressures. With ∼$3.7 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, CYH targets operational efficiency, cost controls, and volume growth to drive profitability in a fragmented $1.5 trillion U.S. healthcare market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 1, 2024)**: Revenue $3.0 billion (up 1.4% YoY); Net loss $25 million or ($0.21) per diluted share; Adjusted EBITDA $256 million (margin 8.5%, up from 7.7% YoY).

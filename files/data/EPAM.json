Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **AI Market Growth:** The competitive landscape for EPAM Systems is significantly influenced by the rapid expansion of the global digital transformation market, which is anticipated to reach approximately $10.76 trillion by 2034, demonstrating a robust CAGR of 24.74% starting in 2025. This growth is largely propelled by the increasing integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence across industries. In the United States, AI and ML held a substantial 23.7% revenue share within the digital transformation sector in 2024.\n\n- **Strategic Partnerships:** EPAM wins 2025 AWS Global Innovation Partner of the Year Award for delivering innovative and value-added services. \"We are honored to receive the AWS Innovation Award, which underscores our commitment to helping global clients innovate, transform and achieve measurable business results through technology,\" said Vlad Agres, VP, Cloud Business at EPAM.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Integration Challenges:** The integration of NEORIS and First Derivative is the largest in EPAM's history. Failure to harmonize cultures and sales teams could lead to margin erosion.\n\n- **AI Cannibalization Risk:** If EPAM cannot successfully pivot its pricing model, the efficiency gains from AI could lead to lower total contract values.\n\n- **Margin Pressure:** EPAM's non-GAAP operating margins are projected to be between 14.5% and 15.5% for 2025, reflecting the anticipated margin pressures.\n\n- **Leadership Transition:** Replacing a founder-CEO always carries risk.

Market Shares\n\nWhile specific market share percentages are not disclosed in available sources, EPAM's positioning indicates:\n\nWe are proud to be among the top 15 companies in Information Technology Services in the Fortune 1000 and to be recognized as a leader in the IDC MarketScapes for Worldwide Experience Build Services, Worldwide Experience Design Services and Worldwide Software Engineering Services.\n\nEPAM's network of 150+ software and technology partnerships empowers our clients to thrive as adaptive enterprises, delivering agile and resilient solutions in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n**Geographic Expansion Impact:**\nEPAM Systems operates in over 55 countries and regions, with the Americas showing the strongest revenue growth at 12.6% in Q1 2025.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\nEPAM Systems' main competitors include Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and IBM Global Services. These companies offer similar services and compete for market share in the IT services industry.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nEPAM often wins against these firms on high-complexity projects, though legacy providers often underprice EPAM on maintenance-heavy contracts.\n\n**Market Differentiation:**\nEPAM was founded in 1993 by Arkadiy Dobkin and Leo Lozner in New Jersey, with a mission to bridge the gap between Western business needs and the deep engineering talent of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Unlike many competitors who focused on low-cost labor arbitrage, EPAM differentiated itself through \"Product Development Services\" (PDS), treating client projects like software products rather than mere maintenance tasks.\n\n**Globant Competition:**\nWhile Globant has traditionally dominated the Latin American market, EPAM's 2024 acquisition of NEORIS ($630M) has neutralized that advantage, creating a fierce battle for \"nearshore\" delivery for North American clients.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Major Acquisitions:**\n- EPAM Systems, Inc. today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of NEORIS, a Miami-headquartered global advanced technology consultancy with approximately 4,800 professionals across major talent hubs in Latin America, Spain and the U.S.\n\n- The October 2024 acquisition of First Derivative for $290 million strengthens its capabilities in capital markets, particularly in AI and cloud services.\n\n**Strategic Technology Partnerships:**\nStrategic alliances with leading technology providers, including Google, AWS, Microsoft, SAP and Salesforce, combine EPAM's global expertise with EPAM NEORIS' regional capabilities to drive innovation throughout the region.\n\nEPAM has expanded its Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) focusing on GenAI solutions and helping enterprises migrate workloads to AWS. Similarly, the company announced a strategic partnership with Google Cloud in January 2025 to deliver innovative industry solutions leveraging Google's Vertex AI platform.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Transition:**\nEPAM Systems, Inc. today announced that Arkadiy Dobkin, the Company's Principal Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, will transition to the role of Executive Chairman, on September 1, 2025. As part of the planned succession, Balazs Fejes, EPAM's President of Global Business & Chief Revenue Officer, will become Chief Executive Officer and President.\n\n**AI Platform Launches:**\nSince its initial launch in 2023, DIAL has matured from an internal enablement tool into a comprehensive framework used by global clients in financial services, healthcare, insurance, consumer packaged goods, retail and more to operationalize Generative AI. With version 3.0, EPAM introduces a platform that not only supports agentic workflows and data-native reasoning but also addresses key structural challenges of deploying AI at scale in production across business functions.\n\n**Awards and Recognition:**\nEPAM has been named the winner of Innovation Partner of the Year – Global, recognizing organizations that deliver innovative consulting, professional, managed and value-added services. Winners have demonstrated proof in delivering outstanding customer experience via an integrated lifecycle of services, from initial assessments, architecting, developing and deployment of cloud environments to ongoing migration and management of cloud infrastructure and applications.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nEPAM demonstrates strong fundamentals with several positive catalysts but faces near-term execution risks.

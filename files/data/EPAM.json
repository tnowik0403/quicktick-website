(NYSE: EPAM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $172.45\n- **Market Capitalization**: $9.97 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $150.75 - $281.28\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 25.8\n- **Forward P/E**: 15.2\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEPAM Systems, Inc. is a leading global provider of digital platform engineering, software development, and digital transformation services. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania, EPAM operates in over 50 countries with ~50,000 employees as of Q2 2024. The company specializes in helping enterprises build scalable digital platforms, leveraging expertise in software engineering, design, cloud, data, AI/ML, and DevOps. EPAM serves industries like financial services, healthcare, retail, travel, software, and hi-tech, with a focus on full-lifecycle services from strategy consulting to maintenance.\n\nUnlike traditional IT outsourcing firms, EPAM emphasizes \"platform engineering\" – creating proprietary platforms that integrate AI, automation, and composable architectures for faster innovation. In 2023, ~55% of revenue came from North America, 25% from Europe, and the rest from APAC and other regions. The company has grown rapidly via organic expansion and M&A, achieving a historical CAGR of ~25% in revenue from 2018-2022, though growth slowed in 2023-2024 amid macro headwinds. EPAM's engineering-centric model (90%+ engineers) positions it as a partner for complex, high-value projects rather than low-cost labor arbitrage. Recent AI investments aim to capture the generative AI wave, with platforms like EPAM AI Explorer and Starter Kit gaining traction.

Founded in 1957, MGIC enables homebuyers to purchase homes with low down payments (typically less than 20%) by protecting mortgage lenders and investors against losses from borrower defaults. The company writes MI policies on residential mortgages originated by lenders, servicers, and investors, primarily through flow (monthly submissions) and bulk (portfolio) channels. MTG operates via its primary subsidiary, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC), which is approved by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).\n\nMTG's business model thrives on a high-fixed-cost structure, generating strong operating leverage during periods of housing market growth. Key metrics include Insurance in Force (IIF), new insurance written (NIW), and loss ratios. As of Q2 2024, MTG held a significant position in the ~$300B+ MI market, benefiting from deleveraging (paydowns/delinq cures) and market share gains amid industry consolidation. The company emphasizes prudent underwriting, reinsurance partnerships, and capital returns via dividends ($0.115/share quarterly) and share repurchases ($300M authorized in 2024). With a PMIERs sufficiency ratio of 170.4% (Q2 2024), MTG maintains a fortress balance sheet, positioning it for growth as mortgage originations rebound with anticipated rate cuts.

Beyond trading, Nasdaq generates ~70% of revenues from recurring, high-margin sources like data products (real-time market data, analytics), index licensing (e.g., Nasdaq-100), financial technology solutions (regulatory compliance via Verafin, capital markets software via Adenza), and issuer services (listing fees, IR tools). In 2023, it processed over 1 trillion messages daily across platforms.

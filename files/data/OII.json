(OII) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 25, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $25.42 (as of market close October 25, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.59 billion (as of October 25, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $19.30 - $31.77  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nOceaneering International, Inc. (OII) is a global technology leader in engineered services and products primarily serving the offshore energy industry, with growing exposure to renewables and nuclear sectors. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company designs, manufactures, and operates remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), subsea tooling, and asset integrity solutions for deepwater oil and gas exploration, development, and production. Its core segments include Subsea Robotics (ROVs and tooling), Manufactured Products (connectors, clamps), Offshore Projects Group (subsea engineering), Integrity Management & Digital Solutions (inspections, surveys), and Advanced Technologies (aerial/land drones, nuclear services).\n\nOII operates in over 80 countries, with a fleet of ~300 ROVs, making it a key enabler for complex subsea operations amid rising deepwater activity. The company benefits from decades of expertise in harsh environments, supporting majors like ExxonMobil and Shell. Recent diversification includes windfarm support vessels and inspections, plus nuclear decontamination via its Freedom Services acquisition. With offshore oil/gas capex projected to grow 5-7% annually through 2028 (per Rystad Energy, Oct 2024), OII is positioned for steady demand, though cyclicality ties it to crude prices (~$70-80/bbl WTI as of Oct 2024). Q3 2024 revenue hit a record $650.1 million (up 10% YoY), driven by Subsea Robotics backlog of $1.1 billion (announced Oct 23, 2024 earnings call).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Oct 23, 2024):** Revenue $650.1M (vs. $592.6M Q3 2023); Adjusted EBITDA $84.8M (up 42%); Net income $39.2M or $0.38/share (vs. $15.4M prior). Subsea Robotics revenue $346M (up 15%). Backlog $1.48B (up 20% YoY).

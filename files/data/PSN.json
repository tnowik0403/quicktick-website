No Q3 2024 earnings available yet (expected late October 2024). Data aggregated from real-time searches: Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Parsons IR site, Bloomberg, Reuters articles (Oct 2024), Motley Fool discussions, X/Twitter sentiment, and recent contracts via GovConWire/ExecutiveBiz.*\n\n## Company Overview\nParsons Corporation (PSN) is a technology-driven engineering and construction services firm specializing in mission-critical solutions for national security, defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure markets. Founded in 1944 and headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, Parsons operates through two main segments: Federal Solutions (FS, ~65% of revenue, focused on defense, intelligence, space, and cyber) and Critical Infrastructure (CI, ~35%, covering transportation, water, and environmental projects). The company delivers end-to-end services including program management, engineering design, cybersecurity, AI/ML integration, and digital engineering for complex government programs. With ~16,600 employees, Parsons emphasizes backlog-funded contracts (88% of backlog as of Q2 2024), providing revenue visibility. Key markets include U.S. DoD (largest client), intelligence community, NASA, and civilian agencies like DOT/FAA. Parsons differentiates via proprietary tech like the Roma platform (digital engineering) and expertise in hypersonics, C4ISR, and resilient infrastructure. Record backlog hit $11.3B in Q2 2024 (up 13% YoY), driven by defense spending tailwinds and infrastructure modernization. Trading at ~23x forward P/E (above sector avg 20x), PSN benefits from geopolitical tensions boosting defense budgets but faces execution risks in mega-projects.

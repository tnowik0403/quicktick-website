(PLOW) is the North American market leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of snow and ice management attachments and equipment for light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles. Founded in 1959 and headquartered in Milwaukee, WI, the company operates through two main segments: Snow & Ice Management (90%+ of revenue) and \"Other\" (primarily aftermarket parts via the TrynEx segment). Key brands include Western, Fisher, Blizzard, and SnowEx for plows, pushers, and salt/liquid spreaders; Curtis for airport runway equipment; and Dejana for truck upfit bodies and storage solutions (acquired 2020).\n\nPLOW serves a fragmented market via ~4,000 independent dealers and OEM channels, targeting municipalities (40% of sales), contractors (35%), and dealers/exporters (25%). Products enhance vehicle productivity in winter maintenance, with a focus on durability, hydraulics innovation, and salt efficiency. The business is highly cyclical, tied to U.S./Canadian snowfall patterns, but benefits from recurring aftermarket parts sales (40-50% of segment revenue).

Fundamentals solid (P/E 12x fwd, dividend 3.2% yield). Moderate risk via weather dependence balanced by cash flow.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $36**  \n  DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% growth terminal; aligns with 6-8x EV/EBITDA peers). Implies 29% upside for growth-oriented portfolio. Target timeline: 12 months.",

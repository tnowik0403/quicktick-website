(NYSE: CXW) is the nation's largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities, providing government solutions primarily to federal, state, and local agencies. Founded in 1983 and headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, the company manages over 40 facilities across 19 states, with a total capacity exceeding 65,000 beds as of Q2 2024. Its core business segments include Secure Facilities (high-security prisons and immigration detention centers), Non-Residential Services (electronic monitoring and case management), and Residential Reentry Centers (community-based reentry and halfway houses). CoreCivic derives ~80% of revenue from federal contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), supplemented by state departments of corrections and local jails. The company has diversified into government technology solutions and real estate leasing. Amid rising immigration enforcement and federal inmate backlogs, CoreCivic reported record Q2 2024 occupancy at 85.8%. Facing political scrutiny on privatization, it emphasizes rehabilitation programs, cost savings for governments (up to 20% below public facilities), and expansion into electronic monitoring to support long-term growth.\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 18, 2024, via Yahoo Finance):**\n- Closing Price: $13.62\n- Market Capitalization: $1.59 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $9.06 - $16.28\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $499.2 million (+5.7% YoY), Adjusted EBITDA $125.8 million (+18.3% YoY), Adjusted EPS $0.83 (+72.5% YoY), driven by higher occupancy (85.8% vs. 83.6%) and new ICE contracts.

CXW controls ~45-50% of private market (~46,000 owned/operated beds), GEO ~40%.\n- **Forecast**: +2-4% market share growth by 2026, driven by ICE dominance (CXW holds 60% of ICE private beds). Risks: Flat/decline if FY2026 budget cuts materialize (-1-2%).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (Q2 2024)          | CXW              | GEO Group (GEO)  | Public Sector (Benchmark) |\n|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| Revenue                  | $499.2M         | $604.5M         | N/A                      |\n| Adj.

Rationale: Robust federal tailwinds, undervalued at 4.2x 2025 EV/EBITDA (vs. peers 5x), 20%+ upside potential amid immigration policy continuity. Moderate risk from politics offset by $300M cash runway.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $18.00 (30% upside from $13.62). DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth), incorporating Q2 guidance and 5% revenue CAGR to 2027.",

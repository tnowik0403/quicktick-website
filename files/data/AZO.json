Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Mega Hub Expansion\nAs of the end of Fiscal 2025, AutoZone operated 133 Mega Hubs including 14 that opened in just the past three months. Another 25-30 Mega Hubs are expected to open in Fiscal 2026. It will take AutoZone \"quite a few innings\" to reach its goal of more than 200 mega hubs given their longer setup time.\n\nThese are larger models that devote 85% of their floor space to inventory, compared to 50% in conventional AutoZone stores. Mega-hubs can house some 100,000 items and can supply satellite stores with multiple overnight shipments.\n\n### International Store Development\nWith continued dedication to Mexico and Brazil, AZO is set to ramp up store openings in these markets, aiming for as many as 500 annually by 2028, which is poised to boost AutoZone's growth significantly.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company anticipates 65 to 70 store openings worldwide compared with 45 in the same period last year. In fiscal 2026, it expects to open about 350 to 360 stores versus 304 net new stores opened in fiscal 2025.\n\n### Technology Investments\nIn fiscal 2025, the company spent around $1.4 billion in capex and it expects to spend $1.6 billion in fiscal 2026. AutoZone's technology investments to improve the electronic catalog might limit near-term cash inflows.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAutoZone's growth strategy focuses on multiple pillars:\n\n### Geographic Expansion\nThe management team remains committed to opening stores at a fast rate. It added 53 new net stores in its fiscal 2026 Q1. Most were in the U.S., but 12 were in Mexico, and two were in Brazil.\n\n### Commercial Business Growth\nDomestic commercial sales grew by 14.5%, showing strong momentum in this segment. In fiscal year 2025, the company expanded its domestic commercial programs to 6,098 locations.\n\n### Distribution Network Enhancement\nLooking at the near-term, the aggressive expansion of the Mega-Hub program is the latest transformative move. By the end of FY25, they had 367 hub stores, including 133 mega hubs, which are essentially large distribution centers that service local stores and commercial customers faster.\n\n### Digital Transformation\nThe company's omnichannel efforts to improve customer shopping experience are reaping profits. The ramp-up of e-commerce efforts, including ship-to-home next day, buy online, pick-up in stores and commercial customer ordering, is driving traffic to the company's online site, helping it deliver sizzling growth.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Current Client Base\nAutoZone serves a diverse customer base including:\n\n- **DIY Customers**: Individual vehicle owners purchasing parts for self-installation\n- **Professional Mechanics**: Independent repair shops and service centers\n- **Commercial Accounts**: AutoZone maintains partnerships with approximately 35,000 independent repair facilities nationwide, generating $1.2 billion in commercial sales\n- **Fleet Operators**: Companies managing vehicle fleets\n\n### Growth Opportunities\nAutoZone's Commercial business division has a market share of just about 4% to 5%, implying ample room for the company to grow in the B2B space.\n\nThe analyst believes accelerated investments should help the company lift Pro-segment share above the current 5%.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Revenue Growth\nIn 2025, AutoZone's revenue was $18.94 billion, an increase of 2.43% compared to the previous year's $18.49 billion. Earnings were $2.50 billion, a decrease of -6.17%.\n\n### Q1 2026 Performance\nAutoZone Inc reported an 8.2% increase in total sales for the quarter. Total Sales Growth: 8.2% increase to $4.6 billion.\n\nEarnings per share decreased by 4.6% due to a non-cash $98 million LIFO charge, but would have risen 8.9% excluding this charge.\n\n### Financial Health Metrics\nAutoZone's financial performance reflects a solid foundation, with a revenue of $18.94 billion and a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.9%. The company's gross margin is robust at 52.63%, while the operating margin stands at 19.06%, indicating efficient cost management. However, the net margin of 13.19% suggests room for improvement in profitability.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n\n#### Tariff and LIFO Impacts\nLooking ahead, it expects another LIFO charge of about $60 million for each of the next three quarters due to higher tariff-related costs. Expected LIFO accounting charge is likely to hit AZO's gross margin, operating profit and earnings per share in the upcoming quarters.\n\nThe analyst said tariff-driven cost inflation is weighing on margins and expects LIFO headwinds to persist ($120 million in the first quarter and $80–$85 million per quarter for the rest of 2026).\n\n#### Operational Pressures\nSG&A expenses increased by 10.4%, leading to a 69 basis points deleverage as a percentage of sales. DIY traffic was down 3.4%, with a notable decline in the middle four-week segment due to unfavorable weather comparisons.\n\n#### Balance Sheet Concerns\nOn the balance sheet front, AutoZone's current ratio of 0.88 and quick ratio of 0.14 highlight liquidity challenges, while a debt-to-equity ratio of -3.6 indicates a high reliance on debt financing. The Altman Z-Score of 2.89 places the company in a grey area, suggesting some financial stress.\n\n### Tailwinds\n\n#### Aging Vehicle Fleet\nAutoZone benefits from the aging U.S. car fleet, driving steady demand for replacement parts and industry-leading operating margins.\n\n#### Strong International Growth\nIn its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended Nov. 22, the auto parts retailer achieved 11.2% year-over-year comparable sales growth in its international locations, which are primarily in Mexico and Brazil, while its domestic comp sales increased by 4.8%.\n\n#### Market Consolidation\nThe industry is consolidating, with the top four players commanding 45% market share, and AutoZone and O'Reilly gaining from economies of scale and superior service.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Industry Position\nAs of September 2024, AutoZone leads in customer visits with a 32.3% market share, followed by O'Reilly Auto Parts at 18.3%, and Advance Auto Parts at 18%.\n\n40.1% of total visits to the four chains in Q1 went to AutoZone, followed by O'Reilly Auto Parts (32.1%), Advance Auto Parts (18.6%), and NAPA Auto Parts (9.2%).\n\n### Revenue Comparison\nO'Reilly Auto Parts ($16,844.3 million) and AutoZone ($16,768.2 million) are nearly tied as the top revenue-generating companies in the U.S. Advance Auto Parts generates significantly less revenue ($11,454 million) compared to O'Reilly and AutoZone.\n\n### Store Count Leadership\nO'Reilly Auto Parts follows closely with 6,192 locations, suggesting it is a direct competitor to AutoZone in terms of physical footprint. NAPA Auto Parts (5,604 locations) and Advance Auto Parts (4,478 locations) make up the rest of the top four.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)\nSimilar to AutoZone, O'Reilly has a strong balance sheet with a BBB rating. It should come as no surprise then that ORLY boasts consistent earnings and best-in-class growth of 20% over the last 20 years.\n\nO'Reilly has just 8% market share (5% 5 years ago) and Autozone a little more. Advance Auto, the biggest listed competitor (11 billion in sales) is in great difficulty.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nIts focus on the Mega-Hub model is a structural advantage, essentially turning its largest stores into hyper-efficient distribution centers that can deliver hard-to-find parts faster than competitors.\n\nAutoZone has several key strengths that enable it to maintain a competitive edge in the automotive aftermarket industry. One of its primary strengths is its extensive inventory, which includes over 100,000 different parts and accessories, ensuring availability for\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Historical Acquisitions\nAutoZone acquired ALLDATA®, the leading provider of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) automotive repair information and solutions.\n\nIn addition, we continued to focus on growing sales at our IMC branches. Acquired in 2015, IMC and its 26 locations represent the second largest distributor of original equipment (\"OE\") quality import replacement parts in the United States. With its extensive line of OE brands for most European and Asian cars, we believe IMC has strong prospects.\n\n### Key Supplier Relationships\nAutoZone partners with over 5,000 automotive parts manufacturers globally.\n\n### Current Strategic Partnerships\nThe majority of stores have a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products and commercial credit to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations, fleet owners and other accounts.\n\n## 12.

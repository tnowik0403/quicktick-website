(NYSE American: ACNT) is a diversified industrial manufacturing company specializing in engineered consumables and solutions for critical infrastructure, energy transition, and industrial markets. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates through three main segments: Infrastructure Products (cast iron soil pipe and fittings via Tyler Union), Engineered Solutions (precision metal components for rebar fabrication and other industries via CWP and ETS), and Tubular Products (welded carbon steel tubing for petrochemical, agriculture, and OEM applications via EXL Tube). \n\nFounded in 2021 from the merger of Crestwood Technology Group and Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Ascent has evolved into a resilient player amid supply chain disruptions and energy market volatility. With ~500 employees across facilities in the U.S. and international operations, it targets high-margin, mission-critical products that support infrastructure buildout (e.g., water/wastewater systems), energy infrastructure (oil/gas, renewables), and industrial OEMs. Revenue is balanced across segments, with Infrastructure Products contributing ~50-60% historically. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, capacity expansions, and bolt-on M&A to drive growth in a fragmented market. As of Q2 2024, Ascent reported trailing 12-month revenue of $164.4 million, navigating cyclical headwinds through pricing discipline and backlog visibility exceeding 12 months in key segments.

The bank delivers a full suite of community banking services to retail, commercial, agricultural, and real estate customers across western Washington, with 24 full-service branches stretching from Olympia to the Seattle metropolitan suburbs. Established in 1915 as a federal savings bank, Timberland focuses on relationship-driven banking, emphasizing residential mortgages, commercial real estate (CRE) loans, commercial business loans, agricultural loans, and consumer lending, alongside deposit products like checking, savings, money market, and certificates of deposit (CDs).  \n\nAs a community-oriented institution, TSBK prioritizes local economic support in Grays Harbor, Pacific, Thurston, Lewis, Clallam, and King counties, maintaining a conservative balance sheet with diversified loan portfolios (residential mortgages ~45%, CRE ~30%) and strong deposit funding (loan-to-deposit ratio ~95%).

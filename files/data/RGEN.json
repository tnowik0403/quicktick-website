Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, the company operates through three segments: Filtration (45% of revenue), Chromatography (38%), and Process Analytics (17%). Its portfolio includes innovative products like single-use systems, chromatography resins, and sensors that improve yield, purity, and scalability in biomanufacturing. Repligen serves over 500 biopharmaceutical companies worldwide, benefiting from the secular growth in biologics production amid rising demand for advanced therapies. Founded in 1983, it has evolved from a protein manufacturing firm into a pure-play bioprocessing leader via organic innovation and strategic M&A. With ~1,400 employees and a global footprint (U.S., Europe, Asia), Repligen reported Q2 2024 revenue of $162.9 million (up 6% YoY organically), driven by consumables (73% of revenue) and services. The company targets the $30B+ bioprocessing market, emphasizing high-margin, recurring revenue from single-use tech and emerging modalities like cell/gene therapy (CGT), positioning it for mid-teens long-term growth despite near-term biopharma headwinds.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 30, 2024)**: Revenue $162.9M (+6% YoY reported, +4% organic); GAAP net loss $18.6M (due to $28M non-cash goodwill impairment); Adjusted EBITDA $43.8M (27% margin); Consumables revenue $119M (+10% YoY).

Pipeline: Small bolt-ons eyed for analytics.\n- **Major Clients**: Top-10 biopharma (e.g., Pfizer, Regeneron, Moderna - ~40% revenue); Emerging CGT firms (bluebird bio, Spark Therapeutics). Potential: Novo Nordisk (obesity drugs scaling), bluebird bio Phase 3 ramps.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong sustainability (single-use reduces waste 50%); Diversity initiatives.\n- **Moat**: 100+ patents; Sticky consumables (3-5x recurring revenue).\n- **Risks**: 60% revenue U.S.-exposed; China trade tensions.\n- **Analyst Consensus (as of Oct 11)**: 13 Buys/4 Holds (avg PT $187, +31% upside).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy for growth portfolios; Hold for conservative).

Moderate risk from biopharma cycles balanced by 80% recurring revenue.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $185 (30% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 12% 5-yr growth tapering to 5%, 27% margins); aligns with EV/Sales 10x 2025E $700M revenue. Entry below $150 optimal for strong growth (15%+ IRR over 3 yrs).",

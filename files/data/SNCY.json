(NASDAQ: SNCY) is a Minneapolis-St. Paul-based ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) founded in 1983, operating a hybrid business model that differentiates it from pure-play passenger airlines. The company provides scheduled passenger service primarily to leisure destinations in the U.S., Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, emphasizing point-to-point routes from its MSP hub. It also offers public charters (e.g., for casinos and sports teams) and ad hoc charters, alongside a rapidly growing cargo segment via dedicated Amazon Air flights. With a fleet of 57 Boeing 737-800 aircraft (as of Q2 2024), Sun Country focuses on high-utilization assets, ancillary revenue (e.g., baggage fees, seat selection), and cost control. In 2023, passenger revenue was ~65% of total, charter ~15%, and cargo ~20%. The airline serves underserved leisure markets, benefiting from MSP's geographic advantages and seasonal demand from snowbirds and vacationers.

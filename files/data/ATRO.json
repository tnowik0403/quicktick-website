No major 2024 activity; focus on organic. Potential tuck-ins in test systems.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Boeing (25%+ revenue), Airbus (15%), U.S. military (20%), Delta/United/Southwest (aftermarket).\n- **Potential Clients**: Embraer E-Jets upgrades, international airlines (e.g., LATAM USB-C RFP win, Sep 2024); Comac C919 power systems bid.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong safety record; sustainability push via LED lighting (30% energy savings). Supplier diversity improving.\n- **Management**: CEO Peter Gundermann (since 2003) praised for execution (e.g., COVID survival via defense pivot).\n- **Risks**: Customer concentration (Boeing), forex (20% int'l sales), certification delays.\n- **Online Sentiment**: Positive on Seeking Alpha/StockTwits (Oct 2024); analyst upgrades (Roth to Buy, $28 PT, Sep 11, 2024). Reddit r/stocks: Bullish on backlog.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside). Undervalued at 1.1x 2025 EV/Sales vs. peers; 25%+ sales CAGR potential on aviation recovery, backlog conversion. Moderate risk from Boeing exposure offset by defense (stable 20% growth).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $30 (40% upside). Based on 14x 2025E EBITDA ($105M projected), implying 15% margins. DCF supports $28-32 for strong growth portfolio (10% discount rate, 4% terminal growth). Hold below $18; sell only sub-$15 on recession.",

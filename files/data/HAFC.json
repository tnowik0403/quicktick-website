The bank specializes in commercial banking services tailored to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), professionals, and individuals, with a historical focus on the Korean-American and multicultural communities in the U.S. It offers a full suite of deposit products, commercial real estate (CRE) loans, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, small business administration (SBA)-backed loans, and treasury management services. Hanmi operates 35 full-service branches across California (core market), Texas, Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Washington, and Georgia, with total assets of approximately $8.4 billion as of Q3 2024.\n\nThe bank's strategy emphasizes relationship banking in niche immigrant communities while diversifying geographically and by loan type to mitigate risks. It ranks as a top SBA lender nationally, particularly in 7(a) programs, and maintains a conservative balance sheet with strong capital ratios (Tier 1 Leverage Ratio: 12.1% in Q3 2024). Recent earnings reflect resilience amid high interest rates, with net interest margins (NIM) stabilizing at 3.20% in Q3 2024, driven by loan growth and deposit cost management. HAFC's market niche provides sticky, low-cost deposits (60% non-interest bearing), but exposure to office CRE (15% of portfolio) poses sector risks. Overall, HAFC positions as a regional player with growth potential in C&I and SBA amid moderating rates.

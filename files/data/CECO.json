Founded in 1912 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company operates through three segments: **Engineered Systems** (38% of Q2 2024 revenue; custom-engineered pollution control and fluid handling for power gen, refineries, data centers); **Industrial Process** (36%; aftermarket parts/services for OEMs in refining, power, water); and **Energy Transition Solutions** (26%; emerging tech like hydrogen reforming, carbon capture, electrolysis for clean energy).  \n\nCECO serves critical end-markets including refining/petrochem (35% revenue), power gen (20%), data centers (growing to 15%+), industrial manufacturing, and municipal water/wastewater. With ~2,300 employees across 100+ locations in 15 countries, it reported record Q2 2024 backlog of $614M (+61% YoY), driven by energy transition demand. The company emphasizes innovation in decarbonization, leveraging M&A for bolt-on growth, and recurring revenue from aftermarket services (targeting 40%+ of sales). Positioned at the intersection of strict EPA regulations and green energy megatrends, CECO benefits from secular tailwinds like AI-driven data center expansion and net-zero goals, positioning it for multi-year compounding.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024)**: Revenue $111.7M (+26% YoY); Gross margin 28.5% (+200 bps); Adj.

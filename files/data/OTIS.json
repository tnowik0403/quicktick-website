Headquartered in Farmington, Connecticut, the company operates in over 200 countries and territories, serving urban and commercial real estate markets. Otis designs, manufactures, and services a broad portfolio of products, including passenger and freight elevators, escalators, moving walkways, and related digital service solutions. Its business is divided into two main segments: New Equipment (representing ~35% of revenue, focused on sales and installation) and Service (65%, providing recurring maintenance and modernization). The service segment generates high-margin, predictable cash flows, insulating Otis from cyclical new-build demand.\n\nOtis traces its roots to Elisha Otis's 1854 safety elevator invention and was spun off from United Technologies (now RTX) in April 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, it employs ~71,000 people and maintains a service backlog exceeding $11 billion, providing visibility into future revenues. The company capitalizes on urbanization trends in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, where megacities drive demand for vertical transportation. Otis emphasizes digital innovation via its Otis ONE IoT platform, which enables predictive maintenance and remote monitoring, enhancing service margins. Financially robust, Otis returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in 2023. Challenges include supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, but its ~25% global market share in elevators positions it for steady mid-single-digit growth amid global infrastructure spending.

Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Bedford, Texas, the company operates through a network of company-owned retail centers and independent dealers, focusing on high-quality, customizable single-wide and multi-section homes priced from $50,000 to $200,000+. Legacy targets first-time homebuyers, low-to-moderate income families, and retirees seeking cost-effective alternatives to traditional site-built housing. With 19 manufacturing facilities across Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Florida, Legacy produces over 1,800 homes annually, emphasizing energy-efficient designs, modern floor plans, and rapid delivery (as little as 30 days). The company went public in 2021 via a SPAC merger with Tribeca Capital, achieving rapid growth amid housing shortages. In 2023, Legacy expanded into tiny homes and park models to tap RV and vacation markets. Its vertically integrated model includes financing via Legacy Housing Finance, which originates loans for ~70% of sales, mitigating dealer dependency. As of Q2 2024, Legacy holds a niche in the ~$10B U.S. manufactured housing sector, benefiting from regulatory approvals for HUD-code homes on private land.

Hold if risk-averse.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $32.00 (35% upside). Based on 15x 2025E EPS ($2.40; derived from Q2 guide +15% growth), DCF (10% WACC, 5% terminal), and peer comps.

(MEI) is a global designer and manufacturer of electrical, electronic, wireless, sensing, and optical solutions, serving diverse end-markets including automotive, appliance, cloud computing (data centers), industrial, aerospace, rail, and off-highway equipment. Headquartered in Chicago, IL, with ~4,500 employees across facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, MEI specializes in custom-engineered components and subsystems that enable human-machine interfaces, power distribution, and data transmission. Founded in 1946, the company has evolved from basic connectors to advanced technologies like high-speed data interconnects for AI-driven data centers and EV power products. In FY2024 (ended May 31, 2024), automotive accounted for ~55% of sales, with growing contributions from Industrial (~25%) and Interface (~20%). MEI reported FY2024 net sales of $1.13 billion (down 8% YoY) amid automotive weakness but is pivoting toward high-growth areas like liquid-cooled data center solutions and EV busbars, leveraging its manufacturing scale and IP portfolio of 200+ patents. (Word count: 168)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported Sep 24, 2024)**: Net sales $172.8M (down 19% YoY from $212.4M); GAAP net loss $25.5M or ($0.72)/share (vs. $0.2M profit prior); Adjusted EBITDA -$3.9M (vs. $10.7M).

No major inbound M&A since 2021.\n- **Recent**: Strategic alliance with Veoneer (active safety sensors, renewed Jul 2024).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Automotive - GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota (~40% sales); Appliances - Whirlpool, GE (~15%); Rail - Siemens, Alstom.\n- **Potential**: Hyperscalers (AWS, Google Cloud - sampling data center products, per Sep 24 call); Tesla/BYD for EV busbars (qualification phase).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong supplier code; 30% renewable energy usage (2024 Sustainability Report).\n- **Innovation**: 15 new patents FY2024; R&D spend 4% of sales.\n- **Risks**: High debt/equity (0.6x); China exposure (20% sales, tariff risks).\n- **Sentiment**: Mixed - Seeking Alpha/StockTwits (Oct 2024): Bearish on auto (target $8), bullish on data center pivot (target $15+). Analyst consensus (3 firms): Hold, avg PT $13 (Zacks, Oct 10).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Fundamentals deteriorating (losses, auto weakness), but data center/EV upside offers recovery potential. Moderate risk appetite suits if catalysts hit, but near-term volatility high.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $14.50 (55% upside). Based on 1.2x FY2026E sales ($1.2B, 8% CAGR per mgmt guidance), 25% gross margins, 8x EV/EBITDA multiple (peer avg discounted for risks). Strong growth portfolio would require Q3 data center revenue beats.",

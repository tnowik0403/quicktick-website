Founded in 2004 and headquartered in San Francisco, Unity's core Unity Engine allows creators to develop 2D/3D games, AR/VR apps, simulations, and interactive content for platforms like mobile (iOS/Android), consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Switch), PC, and emerging metaverse/automotive systems. Beyond gaming, Unity serves non-gaming verticals through real-time 3D (RT3D) tools for virtual production, digital twins, and industrial visualization. The platform monetizes via subscriptions (core engine access), growth solutions (analytics, ads, multiplayer services), and strategic partnerships (custom enterprise deals). As of Q2 2024, Unity supports 3.8 million monthly active users and powers 25 billion downloads annually. Recent challenges like the 2023 runtime fee backlash have shifted focus under new CEO Matthew Bromberg (appointed April 22, 2024) toward creator trust, AI integration, and non-gaming expansion to stabilize revenue amid maturing mobile gaming markets.

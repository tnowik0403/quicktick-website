Fundamentals stellar (record earnings, inflows), undervalued vs. historical 18x P/E at 13.5x fwd EPS ($18.50 est 2025). Sector tailwinds from markets/ETFs outweigh headwinds; moderate risk via diversified boutiques.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $285 (23% upside from $231.32). Based on 15.5x 2025 EPS ($18.50, consensus) + 20% premium for 12% EPS CAGR; DCF implies $290 (8% discount rate, 3% terminal). Hold if risk-averse; target 12-month.",

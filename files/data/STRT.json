The company specializes in mechanical and electro-mechanical products such as keys, locks, latches, power access systems (e.g., sliding doors and liftgates), ignition systems, and electronic locks. STRT serves primarily North American light vehicle OEMs, with General Motors (GM) as its largest customer (approximately 40-45% of revenue historically). It also supplies Ford, Stellantis, and others through long-term supply agreements.\n\nSTRT operates through three segments: Automotive (core OEM sales, ~90% of revenue), Aftermarket (via subsidiary Vehicle Access Systems Technology - VAST), and Other (includes key fobs and security products). The company has expanded into electronics-integrated solutions like passive entry passive start (PEPS) systems and is pursuing growth in power access products amid the shift to SUVs and electrified vehicles. With ~4,000 employees across facilities in the US, Mexico, and China, STRT reported FY2024 net sales of $556.3M (verified from Aug 20, 2024 10-K filing). It maintains a niche leadership in NA mechanical access products while adapting to EV trends and supply chain localization. Challenges include OEM production volatility and EV platform shifts, but tailwinds from power access demand position it for modest recovery.

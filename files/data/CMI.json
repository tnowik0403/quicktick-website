(NYSE: CMI) is a global power solutions leader designing, manufacturing, distributing, and servicing engines, generator sets, and related technologies. Founded in 1919 and headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, the company operates in four core segments: Engines (39% of 2023 revenue), Distribution (31%), Components (20%), and Power Systems (10%), plus the Accelera zero-emission business unit. Cummins powers on-highway trucks (e.g., Class 8 semis via X15 engines), off-highway applications (construction/mining), marine propulsion, rail locomotives, and standby power generation. With ~75,800 employees across 190 countries, it generated $34.1B in 2023 revenue, emphasizing diesel/natural gas engines (up to 95L displacement) alongside electrification transitions. Key strengths include a vast distribution network (500+ locations), aftermarket services (high-margin recurring revenue), and R&D in hydrogen fuel cells/electrification via Accelera. Recent challenges include a record $1.675B EPA settlement (June 26, 2024) for emissions non-compliance on 630K+ Ram pickups (2013-2019), impacting cash flows. Growth pivots to data center power (gensets), hydrogen, and battery-electric systems amid global decarbonization. Cummins holds leadership in North American heavy-duty trucks (~33% engine share) but faces cyclical demand, supply chain issues, and EV competition.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 30, 2024)**: Revenue $8.471B (-3% YoY); GAAP net income $780M; adj.

Fundamentals solid (15% ROIC, 2.5x FCF yield post-fine); trading at 13.5x fwd P/E (vs. 5-yr avg 15x).\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $345** (9-12 months; 10% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth) + 20% premium for Accelera/aftermarket durability. Targets growth portfolio amid industrial recovery.",

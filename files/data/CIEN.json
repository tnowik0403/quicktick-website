Moderate risk via SP exposure balanced by diversification. Recent pullback from $82 highs offers entry.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $95** (30% upside; DCF-based with 10% CAGR, 12% WACC, 45% terminal margin; aligns with consensus PT + backlog multiple). Hold if risk aversion rises on macro. Portfolio fit: Strong growth (AI) with moderate volatility (beta 1.1).",

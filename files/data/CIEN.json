Growth Strategy\n\n**Focus on AI Infrastructure**: Ciena is investing heavily in optical, routing, and network management systems to support AI and cloud infrastructure growth. The company is shifting R&D focus from residential broadband to core optical and data center solutions, including out-of-band management technology.\n\n**Strategic Shift to High-Growth Markets**: The company's strategic pivot to non-telecom customers has been a game-changer. In Q2 2025, 54% of revenue came from non-telco clients, with direct cloud provider revenue growing 85% year-over-year.\n\n**Geographic and Market Expansion**: Geographically, the Americas region continued to dominate Ciena's revenue mix, accounting for 77.9% of total revenue in Q4 FY2025. However, the company saw strong growth in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, which grew 30% year-over-year and represented 14.5% of total revenue.\n\n**R&D Investment Priorities**: The difference stems from Ciena's decision to align strategic investments toward coherent optical systems, interconnects, coherent routing and solutions like DCOM. This has meant redirecting R&D investments into these technologies and ceasing further development of certain broadband activities, the company told Light Reading via email.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Hyperscaler Dominance**: In Ciena Corporation's fiscal second quarter of 2025, direct cloud provider revenue hit a record, making up 38% of total revenue, which was an 85% year-over-year increase. By the third quarter of fiscal 2025, this segment accelerated further, with direct Cloud Provider revenue surging 94% year-over-year to represent 40% of the total $1.22 billion revenue.\n\n**Major Cloud Providers**:\n• Microsoft: This white paper, developed in collaboration between Ciena and Microsoft, explores how zero-trust optical design can deliver resilient metro connectivity. Microsoft contributes its tiered optical business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) architecture, while Ciena provides the foundational transport technologies—the 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, 6500 Reconfigurable Line System (RLS), and the Waveserver® family.\n• Meta: Strategic partnership for DCOM solutions\n• Major hyperscalers (unnamed but referenced throughout earnings calls)\n\n**Traditional Service Providers**:\n• Customers include AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, KT Corporation and Verizon Communications.\n• Verizon: Victor Moreno joins Nicola Benvenuti and Mark Bieberich to discuss Verizon AI Connect, an integrated suite of solutions and products designed to enable hyperscalers, cloud providers and enterprises to deploy AI resource-intensive workloads at scale.\n\n**Neoscalers**: Another major shift this year was the rise of neoscalers - which include a range of AI specialists including AI model developers and GPU-as-a-service providers. Separate from the hyperscalers, neoscalers are part of an expanding ecosystem of network operators building infrastructure for AI, including cloud and edge service providers as well as data center and colocation providers. As AI demands accelerate, neoscalers are building their own highly scalable networks to fuel business growth.\n\n## 7.

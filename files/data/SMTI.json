(SMTI) is a medical technology company specializing in advanced wound and skincare solutions, primarily targeting the $15-20 billion global advanced wound care market (per Grand View Research, 2024). Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Sanara develops, manufactures, and markets an evidence-based portfolio of products that promote healing for surgical and chronic wounds, skin disorders, and biofilm management. Its offerings include biocellulose-based dressings (e.g., CellerateRX® Surgical), silver-based antimicrobials (e.g., BIAKŌS™), and debridement gels (e.g., HYCOL™).  \n\nThe company operates through a hybrid model: direct sales to U.S. hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, complemented by distribution partnerships.

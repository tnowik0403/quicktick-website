(NYSE: MOV) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nMovado Group, Inc. is a leading designer, manufacturer, and distributor of fine watches, operating primarily in the luxury and accessible luxury watch segments. Founded in 1881 and headquartered in Paramus, New Jersey, the company owns iconic brands such as Movado (known for its minimalist Museum Watch design), Concorde, Ebel, Olivia Burton, and MVMT, which it acquired in 2018. It also holds worldwide licenses to produce and distribute watches for prominent fashion and lifestyle brands including Coach, HUGO BOSS, Lacoste, Rebecca Minkoff, Swarovski, and Tommy Hilfiger. Movado sells through a multi-channel approach: wholesale to department stores (e.g., Macy's, Nordstrom), independent jewelers, and its own Movado Company Stores (38 in the US/Canada as of FY24). Direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales via movado.com, mvmt.com, and oliviaburton.com represent growing revenue streams. In FY24 (ended April 30, 2024), the company generated net sales of $830.2 million, with ~60% from licensed brands and 40% from owned brands. It operates manufacturing in Switzerland (for Ebel/Movado), China, and Mexico, emphasizing Swiss movements for premium lines. Movado targets aspirational consumers aged 25-55, blending heritage craftsmanship with modern marketing via social media influencers and celebrity endorsements. The company faces a competitive landscape in a $50B+ global watch market but differentiates through design innovation and brand licensing stability. Recent challenges include soft US wholesale demand and currency headwinds, offset by DTC growth and Asia expansion.

Modest growth upside from DTC/Asia (~5-7% CAGR potential FY26+), but near-term headwinds (US retail softness, margins) cap momentum. Fossil vacuum offers opportunity, but execution risks persist for moderate-risk portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $30.00 (23% upside from $24.52). Based on 11x FY26 EPS consensus ($2.75), 1.1x FY26 sales ($850M), discounted cash flow (8% WACC, 2% terminal growth). Analyst avg. target $32 (Barron's/Zacks Oct 2024). Suitable for growth if Q3 beats expectations.",

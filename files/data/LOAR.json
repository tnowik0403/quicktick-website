(LOAR) is a leading provider of highly-engineered connectivity, aerostructure, and harness solutions for the global aerospace and defense (A&D) markets. Founded in 2020 through a series of acquisitions backed by private equity firm Blackstone Tactical Opportunities, Loar specializes in mission-critical components such as position sensors, connectors, electro-mechanical systems, wire harnesses, and in-flight connectivity products. These are supplied to major OEMs (e.g., Boeing, Airbus) and Tier 1 suppliers for commercial airliners, business jets, military aircraft, and rotorcraft. The company operates 24 global facilities across the US, Mexico, UK, and Czech Republic, employing ~2,000 people. LOAR went public on April 18, 2024, via a $638M business combination with special purpose acquisition company ACP IV (Silver Crest Acquisition Corp.), debuting at ~$44/share and surging >100% within weeks on strong aerospace recovery tailwinds. In FY2023 (ended Dec 31), LOAR reported revenue of $295M (up 14% YoY) with a $1.1B backlog. Q2 2024 results (Aug 7, 2024) showed revenue of $98.5M (+20% YoY), net income $12.3M (vs. loss prior), and gross margins expanding to 45.2% from better mix and pricing. LOAR benefits from sticky, long-lead-time programs with high barriers to entry, positioning it for multi-year growth amid commercial aerospace production ramps.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Revenue $98.5M (+20% YoY), adjusted EBITDA $36.2M (37% margin), backlog $1.25B (+14% YoY).

LOAR targets 15% rev CAGR to $800M by 2028.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (FY2023 or Latest) | LOAR | HEICO (HEI) | TransDigm (TDG) | Kratos (KTOS) |\n|---------------------------|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Rev ($B)** | 0.30 | 3.5 | 7.0 | 1.0 |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 32% | 38% | 55% | 15% |\n| **Backlog ($B)** | 1.25 | 0.8 | N/A | 1.2 |\n| **EV/Rev Multiple** | 14x | 10x | 18x | 4x |\n| **Growth (Next 3Y CAGR)** | 20% | 12% | 15% | 10% |\n| **Key Edge** | Niche sensors | Broad portfolio | Pricing power | Defense drones |\n\nLOAR trades at premium multiples but justifies via 2x faster growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: MoU with Archer Aviation (Jun 2024, eVTOL); joint dev with Airbus on A321XLR connectors (announced May 2024).\n- **M&A**: 12 acquisitions pre-IPO (e.g., B&C Systems, Aug 2022); no deals post-IPO, but CEO flagged \"active pipeline\" (Aug 7 call).\n- **Major Clients**: Boeing (25%, 737/777), Airbus (15%), Collins Aerospace (RTX, 20%), GE (10%); defense: Lockheed Martin, Bell Textron.\n- **Potential Clients**: Embraer (E2 ramp), urban mobility (Joby, Lilium pilots).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Moat**: Proprietary designs (80% rev), 10+ year program quals, 95% on-time delivery.\n- **ESG**: Carbon-neutral facilities goal by 2030; strong D&I (40% women in mgmt).\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 100% Buy ratings (5 firms); avg PT $85 (3% upside). Online buzz (StockTwits/Reddit): Bullish on backlog, \"next HEICO\" narrative.\n- **Risks**: 60% commercial exposure to Boeing recovery; FX (10% rev intl).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **9/10** (Strong Buy). Exceptional growth (20%+ CAGR) from aerospace supercycle outweighs risks; undervalued vs. peers on FCF yield potential. Moderate risk via backlog visibility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $105/share (27% upside). Based on 35x 2025E EBITDA ($165M midpoint) at 15% discount to TDG/HEICO premium, plus 20% backlog conversion. 18-month horizon for growth portfolio. Hold if risk-averse on Boeing.",

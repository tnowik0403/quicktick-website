(NASDAQ: EXPI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of November 12, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Latest Closing Price| $11.82        |\n| Market Capitalization | $1.98B       |\n| 52-Week High/Low   | $25.67 / $9.72|\n| Avg.

(EXPI) is a pioneering cloud-based real estate brokerage and technology platform, primarily operating through its flagship eXp Realty brand. Founded in 2009 and going public in 2019, eXp differentiates itself by leveraging a virtual world environment called VirBELA (its proprietary metaverse platform) to enable agent collaboration, training, and networking without physical offices. This agent-centric model pays agents 80-85% revenue splits on transactions, retaining a 20% brokerage fee, which fuels rapid agent recruitment. As of Q3 2024, eXp boasts over 88,000 global agents (down from peaks above 90,000), contributing to ~$1.7B quarterly revenue primarily from U.S. residential brokerage commissions. The company has expanded internationally to 24 countries, including Canada, UK, Australia, and India. Beyond brokerage, EXPI offers revenue-sharing tools like stock awards, HD Video Conferencing, and AI-driven DocuSign integrations. Its low-overhead model (SG&A ~5-7% of revenue) yields high gross margins (~94%). Recent innovations include AI agent productivity tools and a push into commercial real estate via eXp Commercial. Despite housing market headwinds from elevated interest rates, eXp's tech moat and agent loyalty position it for recovery as rates decline. Online sentiment (Seeking Alpha, Reddit r/RealEstate, StockTwits) highlights its disruptive model but critiques agent churn amid slowing transactions.\n\n## Recent Developments (Last 6 Months, Sourced from PR Newswire, SEC Filings, Earnings Transcripts via Seeking Alpha)\n- **November 7, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings released – Record revenue of $1.705B (+1% YoY), gross profit $134.8M (+2% YoY), but net loss of $26.4M due to higher agent incentives and marketing.

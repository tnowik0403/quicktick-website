Market Shares\n\n**RPA Market Leadership:**\n- In the Robotic process automation(RPA) category, UiPath has a market share of about 63.0%.\n- UiPath holds the dominant share, followed by Microsoft Power Automate and Automation Anywhere, while IBM RPA and WorkFusion exhibit significantly lower search volumes, suggesting limited market traction.\n- UiPath stands as the Leader in the IPAP assessment – just one of two providers with a 10%+ market share – continuing its multi-year dominance in Everest's automation platform evaluations. It's the largest vendor by RPA-specific revenue, serving more than 10,000 enterprise customers.\n\n**Market Size & Growth:**\n- The global robotic process automation market size was estimated at USD 28.31 billion in 2025 and is predicted to increase from USD 35.27 billion in 2026 to approximately USD 247.34 billion by 2035, expanding at a CAGR of 24.20% from 2026 to 2035.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- In Gartner's 2025 Magic Quadrant for RPA, UiPath also claims the #1 spot – this time for the sixth consecutive year. Interestingly, while Gartner awards second place to Automation Anywhere, Microsoft is a decisive #3 – outpacing the once-dominant SS&C Blue Prism.\n\n**Competitive Advantages vs Microsoft Power Automate:**\n- UiPath was the choice because it was easy to use, had low-code solutions, and orchestration. Power Automate is great, but it doesn't have orchestration. So, you end up with many users having to maintain their own items, and it doesn't really talk to the bots or the processes.\n- UI mapping is still based on the use of connectors which is not as flexible as an UiPath's AI based screen selector when automating screen flows. UiPath's error handling is in-built. Power Automate works best with Azure; UiPath is cloud agnostic.\n\n**Market Position:**\n- According to Gartner's Magic Quadrant, UiPath and Power Automate lead the robotic process automation solutions market. According to Gartner Peer Insights, 93% of companies using UiPath would recommend it to other businesses.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Strategic Technology Partnerships:**\n- The most important relationship for strategic impact to customers and UiPath is its partnership with SAP, under which the two firms collaborated to build an SAP Solution Extension (SOLEX) that embeds UiPath functionality so customers can easily build, deploy, and maintain UiPath automations in their SAP systems. With Anthropic to integrate the latter's Claude 3.5 Sonnet large language model to deliver new AI features in several UiPath products including Autopilot for everyone.\n\n**Major AI Partnerships:**\n- We announced a collaboration with OpenAI to deliver a ChatGPT connector, bringing OpenAI's frontier models directly into enterprise workflows. We also launched a new conversational agent with Google's Gemini models, enabling natural voice-driven automation without complex coding. Additionally, we introduced a new integration with NVIDIA, allowing organizations to enhance high-trust workflows like fraud detection and healthcare with AI models deployed through NVIDIA NIM microservices. And finally, we partnered with Snowflake to combine agentic automation with Snowflake Cortex AI.\n\n**Microsoft Collaboration:**\n- It also announced a collaboration with Microsoft to integrate agentic AI into Microsoft's Teams collaboration software.\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\n- Also in March, UiPath acquired Peak, a Manchester-headquartered AI company specializing in agentic solutions for inventory and pricing optimization, for an undisclosed sum.\n\n## 11.

UiPath holds the dominant share, followed by Microsoft Power Automate and Automation Anywhere, while IBM RPA and WorkFusion exhibit significantly lower search volumes, suggesting limited market traction.\n\n**Detailed Market Share Breakdown:**\n- **UiPath:** 35.8% (market leader)\n- **Automation Anywhere:** 9.7 percent\n- **SS&C Blue Prism:** 8.7 percent\n- **Microsoft Power Automate:** 3.3 percent\n\n### **Competitive Positioning**\nIn Gartner's 2025 Magic Quadrant for RPA, UiPath also claims the #1 spot – this time for the sixth consecutive year. These RPA platforms lead in features like scalability, ease of use, AI integration, and customer support, with UiPath topping every vendor assessment as the market leader. UiPath is ranked #1 for reasons including its robust automation capabilities, strong integration with AI, user-friendly interface, and having the largest RPA-specific ecosystem. It consistently ranks as the top provider on leading vendor assessments, such as those from Gartner and Everest Group, and commands a significantly larger market share than its competitors.\n\n### **Customer Base**\n- It's the largest vendor by RPA-specific revenue, serving more than 10,000 enterprise customers (including over 5,000 dedicated RPA clients) – more than any other pure-play intelligent automation provider\n- Companies using UiPath: 8 out of Fortune 10. Includes Deloitte, Wells Fargo, DHL, Siemens, and Schneider Electric\n- Over 8,563 companies globally utilize UiPath as a Business Process Management (BPM) tool in 2025, with a significant portion, 49.22%, located in the United States\n\n---\n\n## **Industry Certifications & Recognition**\n\n### **Recent Awards & Certifications (2025)**\n- UiPath (NYSE: PATH) announced on October 27, 2025 that it achieved ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification, the first international standard for Artificial Intelligence Management Systems (AIMS). The certification, granted by Schellman after a comprehensive audit, affirms UiPath's AI management system that governs design, development, deployment, and continuous improvement of AI across the UiPath Platform\n- Industry Recognition: The company was named a Leader in several Gartner Magic Quadrant reports, including the inaugural one for Intelligent Document Processing, and its platform was listed among TIME Magazine's \"Best Inventions of 2025.\"\n- UiPath (NYSE: PATH) was named a Leader and Star Performer in the Everest Group Full Suite Intelligent Process Automation Platform (IPAP) PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2025 on November 17, 2025\n\n---\n\n## **Headwinds & Challenges**\n\n### **Market Challenges**\n- However, challenges persist with the lower-end customer segment and foreign exchange headwinds\n- I think when you look at it, definitely the lower end of the segment, we've talked about that. It has a little bit of pressure on the net new ARR. To give you a supplemental metric, our net dollar expansion rate for customers between 100,000 and a million was 113%. So that can quantifiably show kind of the lower cohort having more pressure\n\n### **Competitive Pressures**\n- Generative AI poses a potential threat to traditional RPA models\n- Some have touted UiPath's market dominance as a driving factor in Microsoft's decision to cut the price of Power Automate, democratize AI, and – ultimately – close the gap. Indeed, during its recent Microsoft Inspire event, the tech giant trimmed the price tag of its Power Automate Desktop by 60 percent. Moreover, Microsoft also unveiled a new \"Power Automate Premium\" license, which costs the same as the Per user plan previously did at $15 per user per month\n\n### **Pricing Concerns**\n- Most of the UiPath products are priced higher than competitors. The cost can be a barrier in Hungary, making it difficult for me to persuade others to invest, especially when unattended robots come at a significant price point\n\n---\n\n## **Tailwinds & Growth Drivers**\n\n### **AI Market Expansion**\nThe global RPA market was valued at USD 28.31 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach approximately USD 211.06 billion by 2034, with a CAGR of 25.01% from 2025 to 2034. This robust growth underscores the expanding adoption of automation technologies.\n\n### **Customer Retention & Expansion**\n- Dollar-based net retention was 107%, indicating that existing customers are expanding their spending\n- It demonstrates an exceptional ability to retain customers and increase their spending over time, reporting an impressive 107% dollar-based net retention rate in its latest quarterly results\n\n### **Strategic AI Positioning**\nAI is now a tailwind. The company is in the early stages of monetizing its AI solutions, which could further bolster growth. CEO Daniel Dines emphasized their strategy combining deterministic automation with agentic AI, though the company expects no material AI solution contribution in fiscal 2026\n\n---\n\n## **Forward Guidance & Outlook**\n\n### **Q4 FY2026 Guidance**\n- **Revenue:** projecting revenue between $462 million and $467 million\n- **ARR:** ARR $1.844B–$1.849B\n- **Non-GAAP Operating Income:** approximately $140 million, indicating a commitment to maintaining profitability as it grows\n\n### **Next Earnings**\nUiPath (PATH) is scheduled to report earning on Mar 18, 2026, After Close (Confirmed)\n\n---\n\n## **Analyst Sentiment**\n\n### **Current Ratings**\n- According to 15 analysts, the average rating for PATH stock is \"Hold.\"\n- The 12-month stock price target is $15.36, which is a decrease of -11.37% from the latest price\n- Based on moving averages and other technical indicators, the daily buy/sell signal is Strong Buy\n\n---\n\n## **Investment Recommendation**\n\n### **Buy Rating: 7/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strengths:** Market-leading position with 35.8% market share, strong AI transformation strategy, impressive partnership portfolio, achievement of GAAP profitability, and robust customer retention (107% net dollar expansion)\n- **Growth Catalysts:** S&P MidCap 400 inclusion, expanding AI agent adoption (950+ companies), strategic partnerships with tech giants, and strong Q4 guidance\n- **Concerns:** Pressure on lower-end customer segments, premium pricing vs. competitors, and no material AI revenue contribution expected in fiscal 2026\n\n### **Estimated Fair Value: $19.50**\n\n**Target Price Justification:**\nBased on the company's transition to GAAP profitability, 16% revenue growth trajectory, dominant market position, and the expanding RPA market (projected 25.01% CAGR through 2034), a fair value of $19.50 represents approximately 15% upside from current levels. This valuation accounts for the company's premium market position while factoring in competitive pressures and execution risks in AI monetization.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Dependency on successful AI transformation\n- Competitive pricing pressure from Microsoft\n- Economic sensitivity in lower-tier customer segments\n- Integration complexity of multiple AI partnerships\n\n---\n\n*This analysis is based on publicly available information as of January 10, 2026, and should not be considered as personalized investment advice.*",

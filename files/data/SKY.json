The company designs, produces, and markets a diverse portfolio of manufactured homes, modular homes, multi-section homes, single-section homes, and park model recreational vehicles (RVs), serving retail dealers, community operators, and developers. Formed in 2018 through the merger of Skyline Corporation and Champion Enterprises, SKY has grown via organic expansion and strategic acquisitions, achieving scale in a fragmented industry. In FY2024, it sold 15,179 homes (up 29% YoY), with U.S. operations contributing ~90% of revenue. The company benefits from factory efficiencies, enabling faster, more affordable housing amid chronic U.S. shortages (estimated 4-7M unit deficit). Retailer-direct sales model emphasizes quality customization, with homes priced 20-40% below site-built equivalents. SKY's focus on operational leverage, capacity utilization (reaching 75% in Q4 FY2024), and community-focused products positions it for recovery in a cyclical sector tied to housing affordability, interest rates, and lot availability.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Revenue $511.9M (+19% YoY), net income $66.3M (+283% YoY), gross margin 28.8% (up from 24.1%).

Horton modular pilots); government affordable housing programs (HUD initiatives post-2024 election).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong on sustainability (recycled materials in 40% homes); low carbon footprint vs site-built.\n- **Management**: CEO Mark Yost (since 2018) track record of 5x revenue growth.\n- **Online Sentiment**: Bullish on StockTwits/Reddit (r/wallstreetbets mentions up 50% post-earnings); short interest low at 3.2% (Oct 2024).\n- **Risks**: Weather disruptions (e.g., Q3 2024 hurricanes hit Southeast sales 5%); regulatory zoning hurdles.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** - Hold for conservative; buy for growth upside. Fundamentals solid (earnings momentum, debt-free), sector tailwinds from rates/housing shortage outweigh cyclical risks. Moderate risk via diversification in housing recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $115 (25% upside from $92.07). Based on 12x FY2026 EV/EBITDA (consensus $650M EBITDA), peers at 10-14x; DCF assumes 15% revenue CAGR to 2027 on 20k homes. (Analyst avg PT $96, high $120 - FactSet Oct 11, 2024).",

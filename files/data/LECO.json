Founded in 1966, Linamar operates through two primary segments: Mobility (approximately 80% of revenue) and Industrial (20%). The Mobility segment focuses on powertrain, driveline, and chassis systems for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and off-highway equipment, including machined components, castings, forgings, and assemblies. Key offerings serve internal combustion engine (ICE), hybrid, and electric vehicle (EV) transitions. The Industrial segment provides hydraulic pumps, valves, cylinders, and electronic controls for agriculture, mining, forestry, and material handling equipment.\n\nWith 29,000+ employees across 65 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, Linamar generated CAD 7.0 billion in trailing 12-month sales as of Q3 2024. The company emphasizes vertical integration, from design to production, enabling cost efficiencies and supply chain resilience. Major clients include OEMs like Ford, GM, Stellantis, Cummins, and Volvo. Linamar has pivoted toward electrification and autonomy, investing in EV power electronics and battery systems while maintaining leadership in ICE components amid delayed EV adoption. Its growth is driven by commercial vehicle recovery, agricultural demand, and M&A in high-margin niches.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released November 7, 2024):** Record quarterly sales of CAD 2.46 billion (+15% YoY); Mobility sales CAD 1.94 billion (+17%); Industrial CAD 520 million (+10%).

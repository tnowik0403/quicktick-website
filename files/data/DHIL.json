(NASDAQ: DHIL) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of October 10, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $187.50\n- **Market Capitalization**: $851.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $157.91 - $210.28\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 10.85\n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.8% (annualized $7.20/share)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nDiamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. (DHIL) is an independent, employee-owned investment management firm headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, founded in 1990. The company focuses on providing actively managed investment strategies emphasizing intrinsic value investing, primarily through mutual funds, separate accounts, and institutional portfolios. DHIL manages approximately $11.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of June 30, 2024, targeting long-term investors seeking capital appreciation and income with a disciplined, contrarian approach rooted in fundamental analysis. Its flagship products include small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, and long-short equity strategies, alongside fixed-income and alternative offerings. DHIL differentiates itself by maintaining a boutique structure with low employee turnover (average tenure ~10 years), no leverage in strategies, and a focus on high-conviction positions held for multi-year horizons. The firm earns revenue primarily through asset-based fees (average fee rate ~0.74%), with additional income from model delivery and administrative services. Amid industry consolidation and passive investing trends, DHIL has sustained performance leadership in value categories, though AUM growth has been muted due to net outflows. Recent emphasis on advisor relationships and product innovation positions it for steady, if not explosive, growth in a maturing asset management sector.

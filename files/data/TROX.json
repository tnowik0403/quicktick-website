Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, with operations across the US, Australia, South Africa, and Europe, Tronox mines heavy minerals like ilmenite, rutile, and zircon from its key assets, including the Namakwa Sands (South Africa), Kwale (Kenya, now divested), and Cooljarloo (Australia) operations. The company produces TiO2 via chloride and sulfate processes at facilities in the US (Nevada), Australia (Kwinana), and the Netherlands (Botlek). In 2023, Tronox generated ~$2.85B in revenue, split ~60% pigments/40% mining & chemicals segments. It holds a strong position in high-growth zircon (used in ceramics/refractories) and titanium slag markets. Recent strategic shifts emphasize restarting idled South African assets and optimizing costs amid TiO2 oversupply. Tronox benefits from a low-cost chloride-process focus but faces cyclical TiO2 pricing pressures. With ~7,900 employees, it targets sustainable mining and ESG compliance, positioning for recovery in construction/infrastructure-driven demand.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 31, 2024):** Revenue $694M (vs. $745M YoY, down 7%); Adjusted EBITDA $94M (margin 13.6%, down from 17.1%); Net loss $61M.

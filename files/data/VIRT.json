(VIRT) is a leading global algorithmic trading and market making firm founded in 2008, headquartered in New York City. The company specializes in providing liquidity and execution services across multiple asset classes, including equities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded products (ETPs), fixed income, currencies, commodities, energy, and derivatives. Virtu operates through two primary segments: Market Making (principal trading where it takes risk to provide liquidity) and Execution Services (agency-only execution via its ITG subsidiary, acquired in 2020). \n\nIn Market Making, Virtu uses proprietary technology and high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies to profit from bid-ask spreads and short-term price inefficiencies, handling over 25,000 securities daily across 235+ venues in 35 countries. Execution Services offers independent trading platforms like Triton and POSIT, serving institutional clients with low-touch, high-quality execution. Virtu's technology stack emphasizes low-latency infrastructure, AI-driven models, and risk management, enabling it to capture ~5-10% of global equity trading volume in key markets. \n\nThe firm has evolved from pure HFT to a diversified liquidity provider, benefiting from retail flow partnerships (e.g., with broker-dealers) and institutional demand for efficient execution amid fragmented markets. With ~2,500 employees, Virtu generated $2.88 billion in 2023 revenues, focusing on scalable, capital-efficient growth. Recent emphasis on options market making and fixed income expansion positions it for structural tailwinds like rising volatility and electronification of markets.

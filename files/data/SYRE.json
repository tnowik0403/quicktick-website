(SYRE.V), operating primarily through its Justo brand, is a technology-driven residential real estate brokerage platform focused on the Mexican market. Launched in 2021, Justo disrupts the traditional 5-6% commission model by offering a low 1.5-4% commission structure powered by proprietary AI and machine learning tools. The platform integrates an agent network with a mobile/web app that streamlines listings, virtual tours, valuations, lead generation, and transactions, targeting urban millennials and Gen Z buyers/sellers. Justo operates in 10+ cities, including Mexico City (CDMX), Monterrey, Guadalajara, Mérida, and Querétaro, with over 1,200 active agents and 15,000+ listings as of Q2 2024. The company benefits from Mexico's real estate boom driven by nearshoring, tourism recovery, and domestic demand, positioning itself as the leading tech-enabled brokerage in Latin America's largest economy. Revenue is generated via commissions on transactions, subscription fees for premium agent tools, and ancillary services like financing referrals. Synergy aims to capture a slice of Mexico's ~USD 20B annual residential brokerage market by scaling tech efficiencies and agent recruitment amid a fragmented, agent-heavy sector dominated by independents and legacy firms.

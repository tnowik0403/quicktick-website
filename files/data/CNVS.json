The company serves niche genres (horror, anime, indie) and partners with major studios for distribution. With a focus on AI-driven personalization and multi-platform distribution (Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung TV), Cineverse reported FY2024 revenue of $64.1M (up 11% YoY), driven by subscription growth.

(SNDR) is a leading North American transportation and logistics provider, founded in 1935 and headquartered in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The company operates one of the largest private truck fleets in the U.S., with approximately 12,000 tractors and 45,000 trailers, delivering truckload, intermodal, and third-party logistics (3PL) services across North America. Its business is segmented into three main units: Truckload (57% of 2023 revenue), which includes van truckload, dedicated carriage, and bulk services; Intermodal (17%), offering drayage and rail-linked transport; and Logistics (26%), encompassing brokerage, supply chain management, and warehousing. Schneider serves diverse industries like retail, food/beverage, manufacturing, and consumer goods, emphasizing technology-driven solutions such as its proprietary Schneider FreightPower platform for digital booking and visibility. With a focus on safety (top-tier CSA scores), sustainability (electric vehicle pilots), and driver retention (industry-leading programs), Schneider generated $5.5 billion in 2023 revenue. It competes in a fragmented $800+ billion U.S. trucking market, positioning itself as a resilient, asset-light hybrid carrier amid cyclical freight cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 30, 2024)**: Revenue $1.58 billion (down 6% YoY from $1.68B); Truckload revenue $952.4M (down 7%); Intermodal $277.2M (up 2%); Logistics $350.5M (down 12%). Operating ratio 96.5% (up from 94.7% YoY); Diluted EPS $0.10 (down from $0.36).

Sector rebound expected H2 2025.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $32.00** (16% upside from $27.46): Based on 12x 2025 EPS consensus ($2.10, per FactSet/Yahoo Finance avg. of 11 analysts); EV/EBITDA 7x (peer avg. 8x adjusted for cycle). Suits moderate risk/growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annual returns via recovery.",

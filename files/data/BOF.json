(BOF) is a Nasdaq-listed ag-tech company specializing in the processing and marketing of innovative, healthy snack products derived from organic and non-GMO plantain bananas grown in Ecuador. Founded in 2021 and headquartered in Walla Walla, Washington, the company transforms whole plantains into value-added products like dried banana slices, chips, powders, and flours, targeting the $100B+ global healthy snacks market. Unlike traditional banana processors focused on Cavendish varieties, BOF leverages plantains—a starchier, more nutritious fruit—for products that emphasize high fiber (up to 20g per serving), low sugar, and clean-label appeal, positioning them as keto-, paleo-, and diabetic-friendly alternatives to potato chips or tropical fruit snacks.\n\nBOF's vertically integrated model includes sourcing from partner farms in Ecuador, processing via proprietary \"Clean Slice\" air-drying technology (avoiding frying or sulfites), and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales alongside retail distribution. Revenue streams split ~70% retail/B2B and ~30% DTC via Amazon and its website. The company aims to disrupt the $90B U.S. snack bar/chips segment by offering shelf-stable, nutrient-dense options with 3x the potassium of bananas and superior shelf life (18+ months). With a microcap market presence, BOF reported explosive revenue growth from $188K in 2022 to $5.1M in 2023, driven by e-commerce ramp-up and retail listings. However, it remains pre-profit, focusing on scaling production capacity from 1M to 10M lbs/year.

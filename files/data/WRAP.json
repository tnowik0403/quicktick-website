(NASDAQ: WRAP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $1.72 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close October 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $33.47 million (Yahoo Finance, as of October 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $0.87 - $2.45  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 289,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nWrap Technologies, Inc. (WRAP) is a provider of modern policing technologies, specializing in non-lethal remote restraint solutions for law enforcement, corrections, and security professionals. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, the company develops and sells the patented BolaWrap® family of devices, which use a Kevlar tether fired up to 25 feet to safely restrain non-compliant subjects from a distance, reducing the need for physical confrontations or lethal force. Complementing hardware, Wrap offers the SMART sUAS Training and Readiness Optimization (SU TRO) platform, an AI-powered drone training system launched in 2024 to enhance law enforcement drone operations.\n\nThe company's mission focuses on \"Better Outcomes, Fewer Injuries\" amid rising scrutiny on police use-of-force incidents. WRAP targets domestic U.S. agencies (primary revenue source) and international markets, with products adopted by over 900 agencies across 48 U.S. states and 18 countries as of Q2 2024. Revenue is generated via direct device sales (~70% of revenue), cartridges, training, and subscriptions. Despite innovative tech, WRAP remains pre-profit, with a lean operation (50 employees) navigating a niche less-lethal market valued at ~$1.2B globally (growing 8-10% CAGR per MarketsandMarkets). Challenges include long sales cycles (6-18 months) in government procurement, but tailwinds from de-escalation mandates post-2020 social unrest position WRAP for adoption.

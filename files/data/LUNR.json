(NASDAQ: LUNR) is a Houston-based space exploration company specializing in lunar access services, infrastructure, and data solutions. Founded in 2013, it designs, manufactures, and operates end-to-end lunar missions using its proprietary Nova-C lunar lander platform, which enables payload delivery, communications, and surface operations on the Moon. The company achieved a historic milestone as the first private entity to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the lunar surface with its Odysseus mission (IM-1) on February 22, 2024, under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Intuitive Machines focuses on the burgeoning lunar economy, supporting NASA's Artemis program by providing ride-share opportunities for government and commercial payloads, including NASA instruments for scientific data collection. Its services extend to lunar data relays, navigation, and resource utilization technologies. With a vertically integrated approach—from propulsion systems to mission operations—the company targets both near-term government contracts and long-term commercial markets like resource prospecting and telecom infrastructure. As of Q2 2024, it reported a backlog of approximately $328 million, positioning it as a key player in the U.S. space sector amid growing global interest in cislunar space.

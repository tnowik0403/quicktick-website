The company provides technical advisory services to support clients in obtaining planning consents, environmental permits, and regulatory approvals across sectors including energy (renewables, oil & gas transition, hydrogen, CCUS), infrastructure, waste & resources, and industrial developments. Core services encompass air quality and odour dispersion modelling, noise and vibration assessments, climate change risk/opportunity evaluations (including TCFD-aligned reporting), flood risk and drainage assessments, and water environment impact analysis. With ~200 employees, WKC operates from offices in Wallingford (UK HQ), Nottingham (UK), Dublin (Ireland), Denver and Houston (US), and Dubai (UAE/Middle East). The firm leverages proprietary software (e.g., ADMS dispersion model expertise) and multidisciplinary teams to address complex environmental challenges amid global energy transition and net-zero goals. Revenue is project-based, with long lead times offset by a robust order book and pipeline. In FY23 (ended 31 Dec 2023), WKC reported revenue of £22.6m (+36% YoY) and adjusted EBITDA of £4.1m (+43% YoY), driven by energy sector demand. The company positions itself as a niche leader in high-growth areas like offshore wind, hydrogen, and decarbonization, targeting international expansion to capitalize on regulatory tailwinds in the UK, US (via IRA incentives), EU Green Deal, and Middle East diversification.

Company Overview\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc., doing business as O'Reilly Auto Parts, is an American automotive part retailer that provides automotive parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories to professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers.

This balanced approach is a key element of the O'Reilly Auto Parts business model. This approach has fueled consistent growth, with 32 consecutive years of comparable store sales growth through 2024.\n\n## 2.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nWe stay ahead of automotive trends, expanding our selection to include parts for newer vehicle technologies, including hybrid and electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, and modern infotainment solutions.\n\nNear-Term EV Surge Supports Auto Parts Demand: The EV market is experiencing a short-term boost, with U.S. sales hitting a record 607,089 units in the first half of 2025, up 1.5% year over year. Although second-quarter sales dipped 6.3% year over year, a 4.9% rise from the first quarter suggests that momentum is building ahead of federal incentive phase-outs in September. This anticipated third-quarter surge in EV purchases could provide a lift for auto parts retailers, particularly those stocking EV-specific components.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nStore Growth and Distribution Network Enhancements · The company continues its aggressive store expansion, opening 198 net new stores in 2024 and planning for 200 to 210 new stores in 2025. In Q1 2025, 38 net new stores were opened. Investments in its distribution network include relocating the Atlanta distribution center in Q4 2024 and developing a new 530,000-square-foot facility in Stafford, Virginia, set to be operational by mid-2025.\n\n**International Expansion:**\n• **Mexico**: The company is in the early innings of expansion but gaining momentum, increasing density outside their historical base in Guadalajara. As of July 2025, O'Reilly marked a milestone of 100 stores in Mexico operating in nine Mexican states. The company's goal is to continue actively expanding its footprint to increase market share. By comparison, AutoZone entered the Mexican market in 1998 and currently has over 800 stores in Mexico.\n• **Canada**: On January 22, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced strategic acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto (\"Vast Auto\"), an auto parts supplier headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At the time of the acquisition, Vast Auto operated two distribution centers and six satellite warehouses that support a network of 23 company-owned stores and thousands of independent jobber and professional customers across Eastern Canada.\n\n**Future Expansion Plans**: ORLY expects 200–210 new store openings in 2025 and up to 235 in 2026, with comparable store sales growth guidance raised to 4–5%.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Customer Segments:**\n• **Professional Service Providers (48% of sales)**: The professional segment includes independent repair shops, national service chains, and fleet operators who rely on timely access to a wide range of parts and supplies.\n\n• **DIY Customers (52% of sales)**: The DIY segment comprises individual vehicle owners who perform their own maintenance and repairs, often driven by cost savings or a personal interest in automotive care.\n\nFor professionals, we offer specialized services including early opening hours, dedicated counter service, and delivery options to help keep your business running efficiently. Our commercial programs are tailored to provide the support that professional shops need to serve their customers effectively.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n• **Revenue**: Net income for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025, increased $60 million, or 9%, to $726 million (or 15.4% of sales) from $665 million (or 15.2% of sales) for the same period one year ago.\n• **Comparable Store Sales**: We are pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and profitable growth, highlighted by a 5.6% increase in comparable store sales and a 12% increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter.\n• **EPS**: Diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter increased 12% to $0.85 on 853 million shares versus $0.76 on 875 million shares for the same period one year ago.\n\n**Full-Year 2024 Performance:**\n• **Revenue**: In 2024, O'Reilly Automotive's revenue was $16.71 billion, an increase of 5.67% compared to the previous year's $15.81 billion.\n• **Earnings**: Earnings were $2.39 billion, an increase of 1.71%.\n\n**2025 Guidance Updated:**\n• For 2025, O'Reilly estimates total revenues in the range of $17.6-$17.8 billion compared with the previous estimate of $17.5-$17.8 billion. It expects EPS in the band of $2.90-$3 compared with the prior estimate of $2.85-$2.95.\n• As a result of our year-to-date performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2025, we are raising our full-year 2025 comparable store sales guidance to a range of 4.0% to 5.0%. We remain confident in the underlying demand drivers of our industry and our Team's ability to grow our share of the market by delivering industry-leading customer service.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• **Aging Vehicle Fleet**: With many Americans opting to extend the life of their cars, the aging fleet continues to act as a tailwind for the industry's long-term expansion. At the same time, vehicles are getting more complex, pushing many drivers to rely on professionals, thus giving a lift to the DIFM segment.\n• **Pricing Power**: While O'Reilly Automotive sources a significant portion of its inventory from regions potentially subject to tariffs, the company has shown an ability to pass these increased costs on to customers. Historically, this has allowed them to maintain or even improve their gross profit margins, despite higher input costs. The essential nature of auto parts makes consumers more willing to absorb price increases than they might for discretionary goods.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• **Valuation Concerns**: However, its valuation metrics—particularly a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.97—raise critical questions about whether its momentum is justified by fundamentals or signals a potential overextension.\n• **EV Transition**: EVs have significantly fewer moving parts (pistons, spark plugs, etc.) than internal combustion engines, which could reduce demand for traditional DIY repairs and shift service revenue to manufacturers.\n• **Consumer Spending Pressure**: Industry remains resilient with steady demand for vehicle maintenance despite some consumer pressure at the lower end; more trade-up than trade-down observed in recent months. Pullbacks in consumer spending are typically short-lived, lasting one to three quarters, but vehicle maintenance remains essential.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Market Share by Customer Visits:**\n• As of September 2024, AutoZone leads in customer visits with a 32.3% market share, followed by O'Reilly Auto Parts at 18.3%, and Advance Auto Parts at 18%.\n• 40.1% of total visits to the four chains in Q1 went to AutoZone, followed by O'Reilly Auto Parts (32.1%), Advance Auto Parts (18.6%), and NAPA Auto Parts (9.2%). Though AutoZone continues to lead in relative visit share, O'Reilly Auto Parts boasts the most loyal customer base of the four chains.\n\n**Market Position:**\n• AutoZone, for instance, commands a larger share in the do-it-yourself (DIY) market, often in the low to mid-teens percentage range, while O'Reilly's market share is estimated around 10%.\n• O'Reilly is the most profitable auto parts store in the US, generating the most revenue in the aftermarket industry in 2024.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Store Count Comparison:**\n• While AutoZone has more stores (6,451) than O'Reilly (6,192), O'Reilly's generates slightly more revenue ($16,844.3 million).\n\n**Digital Presence:**\n• Digital visibility also favors AutoZone, which holds 28.3% of U.S. auto parts category clicks compared to O'Reilly's 16.75%.\n\n**Valuation Comparison:**\n• While O'Reilly trades at a 36.97 P/E, AutoZone's P/E is 27.73, and AAP's forward P/E is 30x. This gap implies that the market is willing to pay a premium for O'Reilly's superior operating margins (20.2%) and net profit margins (14.33%), but it also raises concerns about relative overvaluation. If AutoZone continues to gain share or AAP stabilizes its operations, O'Reilly's premium could compress.\n\n**Customer Loyalty:**\n• And in April 2024, O'Reilly Auto Parts boasted the most loyal customer base of the four analyzed chains – with 52.0% of visits made by individuals that frequented the chain at least twice during the month.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\n• **Groupe Del Vasto (2024)**: On December 18, 2023, O'Reilly Auto Parts announced it was acquiring Groupe Del Vasto, which does business as Vast-Auto and is headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Additionally, we began operating 23 stores in Canada after closing on the acquisition of Vast Auto in January. With the talented and experienced Vast Auto team now officially a part of Team O'Reilly, we are very pleased with the early momentum we have generated in Canada.\n\n**Historical Acquisitions:**\n• **CSK Auto (2008)**: On July 11, 2008, O'Reilly Auto Parts completed the largest acquisition in its history with the purchase of CSK Auto, adding 1,273 stores in 12 states. This, combined with past acquisitions, made O'Reilly Auto Parts the third largest auto parts chain in the country after Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone.\n\n**Mexico Operations:**\n• **Mayasa (2019)**: O'Reilly entered Mexico by acquiring Mayoreo de Autopartes y Aceites, S.A. de C.V. (\"Mayasa\") in 2019, which initially added 21 stores.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Stock Split**: In March 2025, a 15-for-1 stock split was approved by the Board of Directors to enhance stock accessibility.\n\n**Store Expansion**: The company's commitment to physical presence is evident in its continuous store expansion, with 198 net new stores opened in 2024 and plans for 200 to 210 net new stores in 2025.\n\n**Share Repurchases**: During the reported quarter, O'Reilly repurchased 4.3 million shares for $420 million at an average price of $98.08 per share. From the end of the third quarter until Oct. 22, 2025, the company repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares of common stock for a total investment of $79 million at an average price of $102.96 per share. As of Oct. 22, ORLY had nearly $820 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.\n\n**Employee Count**: As of January 31, 2025, we employed 93,047 Team Members (78,111 full-time Team Members and 14,936 part-time Team Members), of whom 75,940 were employed at our stores, 12,111 were employed at our DCs, and 4,996 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nO'Reilly Automotive presents a solid investment opportunity with a balanced risk-reward profile. The company demonstrates exceptional operational consistency with 32 consecutive years of comparable store sales growth and strong financial metrics. Its dual-market strategy serving both DIY and professional customers provides stability and growth potential.\n\n**Strengths Supporting the Rating:**\n• Consistent financial performance with strong margin expansion (51.9% gross margin in Q3 2025)\n• Dominant market position with superior customer loyalty metrics\n• Strategic expansion into Canada and Mexico providing growth catalysts\n• Strong balance sheet and aggressive share repurchase program\n• Essential products creating pricing power and defensive characteristics\n\n**Concerns Tempering the Rating:**\n• High valuation multiple (P/E of 36.97) compared to peers\n• Potential EV disruption to traditional aftermarket demand\n• Increasing competitive pressure from AutoZone's digital initiatives\n• Consumer spending headwinds at lower income segments\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $105-110**\n\nBased on the company's strong fundamentals, consistent growth trajectory, and market positioning, the fair value appears to be in the $105-110 range, representing modest upside from current levels around $94. This valuation assumes:\n• Continued execution of store expansion plans (200+ new stores annually)\n• Maintenance of current margin levels and market share\n• Gradual normalization of valuation multiple to more reasonable levels\n• Successful international expansion contributing to long-term growth\n\nThe stock offers moderate upside potential with defensive characteristics, making it suitable for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk appetite, though investors should monitor valuation compression risks and competitive dynamics closely.",

(NASDAQ: VRE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 25, 2024 close, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- Stock Price: $24.92\n- Market Capitalization: $1.09 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $16.59 - $28.91\n- Avg. Daily Volume (3 months): 305,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview\nVeritex Holdings, Inc. (VRE) is a Dallas-based bank holding company and the parent of Veritex Community Bank, operating primarily in the high-growth Texas and Oklahoma markets. Founded in 2010 through the merger of two community banks, Veritex focuses on relationship-driven commercial banking for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), real estate investors, and general consumers. The company offers a full suite of deposit products (checking, savings, money market, CDs), lending solutions (commercial real estate [CRE] loans at ~60% of portfolio, commercial & industrial [C&I] loans, construction loans, mortgage warehouse lines), treasury management, and online/mobile banking. With ~$13.4 billion in total assets as of Q3 2024, Veritex has built a top-10 deposit market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metro area through organic growth and strategic M&A. Its mortgage warehouse lending division is a key differentiator, funding ~$2.5 billion in lines as of Q3 2024, serving national mortgage originators. Expansion into Houston (via 2022 B1Bank acquisition) and Oklahoma City/Tulsa (via 2023 acquisition) has diversified its 25-branch footprint. Veritex emphasizes credit discipline amid CRE headwinds, with a conservative 80% loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital position (CET1 ratio 11.2% in Q3 2024). The bank's performance is tied to Texas' robust economy, driven by population influx, energy, and tech sectors, positioning it for sustained mid-single-digit growth despite national banking pressures.

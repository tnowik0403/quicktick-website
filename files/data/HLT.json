Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, diluted EPS was $1.78 and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, was $2.11, compared to $1.38 and $1.92, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $421 million and $976 million, respectively.\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2025 was $3.120B, a 8.82% increase year-over-year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings revenue for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025 was $11.735B, a 6.68% increase year-over-year.\n\n### 2025 Guidance\nDiluted EPS, adjusted for special items, is projected to be between $7.97 and $8.06. Net income is projected to be between $1,604 million and $1,625 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $3,685 million and $3,715 million.\n\n### RevPAR Performance\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, system-wide comparable RevPAR decreased 1.1 percent compared to the same period in 2024 due to modest occupancy and ADR declines. Full Year Guidance includes RevPAR growth of 0 to 1%, indicating limited growth in this metric.\n\n### Balance Sheet Strength\nAs of Sept. 30, 2025, Hilton's total cash and cash equivalents were $1,126 million. Hilton carried $11.7 billion in total debt, with a weighted average interest rate of about 4.8%. Excluding finance lease obligations, total debt stood at $11.6 billion, with no significant maturities before April 2027.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n• **Asset-light business model**: Hilton's asset-light business model is a cornerstone of its financial success. By focusing on franchise and management agreements rather than owning hotel properties, Hilton minimizes the capital-intensive nature of the hospitality business. This approach allows the company to generate higher margins, reduced capital expenditure, and stronger cash flow, even during economic downturns\n\n• **Strong brand portfolio**: The company retained its position as the world's most valuable hotel brand for the tenth consecutive year, with its brand value increasing 30% to USD15.1 billion as of July 2025\n\n• **Growing loyalty program**: Hilton Honors has emerged as the fastest-growing major program, expanding its membership base by 147% to 210 million members\n\n• **Global expansion opportunity**: More than 50 percent of the global hotel supply is unbranded or independent, and Hilton recognized an opportunity to address an unmet need\n\n### Headwinds\n• **Macroeconomic pressures**: Headwinds in the form of softer demand trends in China, persisting inflation and lingering macro risks are restricting HLT's prospects to some extent. These aspects are likely to hinder the company's bottom-line growth moving forward\n\n• **China market challenges**: RevPAR in China declined 3.1% in Q3 2025, largely due to government travel policies affecting business transient and group travel, particularly in Tier two and Tier three cities\n\n• **Business travel recovery**: Business transient RevPAR decreased approximately 1% due to continued economic uncertainty\n\n• **Government travel restrictions**: System-wide RevPAR was down approximately 1% year over year, impacted by unfavorable holidays, softer international inbound to the US, and declines in US government-related travel\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Global Hotel Industry Position\nMarriott: Leads in scale with 8,912 properties and 30+ brands. Its global distribution and Bonvoy program ensure dominance. Marriott leads with 30 brands and 9,100 properties; Hilton follows with 22 brands and 7,500+ hotels worldwide.\n\nMarriott International, the largest hotel company globally, generated $24.76 billion in revenue, securing a market share of 17.55% in the hospitality industry by the third quarter of 2024. Hilton Worldwide, which runs over 7,500 locations worldwide, generated $11 billion in sales and has a 6.35% market share in Q3 2024.\n\n### Asia Pacific Market Share\nOne in every four hotels under construction in Asia carries the Hilton flag. In China, that figure rises to one in three. With one in three hotel rooms under construction bearing the Hilton flag, the company's robust development strategy is set to bring its signature hospitality to even more destinations across China and the wider Asia Pacific region.\n\n### Loyalty Program Competition\nMarriott International has the global hotel sector's most dominant loyalty platform, with 228 million members. Marriott Bonvoy currently leads the global hotel loyalty program sector with 228 million members, although Hilton Honors is rapidly closing the gap, expanding its membership base by 247% since 2018.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Major Competitors Analysis\n**Marriott International**: Leads in scale with 8,912 properties and 30+ brands, focusing on luxury and all-inclusive growth. Its global distribution and Bonvoy program ensure dominance, but integrating acquisitions like Starwood remains a challenge.\n\n**Hyatt Hotels**: Targets affluent travelers with a curated luxury and lifestyle portfolio. Its ALG acquisition strengthens all-inclusive resorts, but its smaller scale (1,398 properties) limits mainstream presence.\n\n**IHG**: Dominates midscale with a franchise-heavy model (80% franchised).\n\n### Hilton's Competitive Position\nHilton: Excels in operational efficiency and brand innovation (e.g., Spark, SLH partnership). Digital tools like Digital Key enhance guest experiences, but its luxury portfolio is smaller than Marriott's.\n\nThe runner-up in terms of market cap is Hilton Worldwide, with a dollar value of 53 billion. Other rivals are significantly behind — Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), the third leader, hits only 16 billion.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Small Luxury Hotels Partnership\nHilton and Small Luxury Hotels of the World announced an exclusive strategic partnership that will welcome Hilton guests to hundreds of independently minded luxury hotels. The partnership will dramatically expand the luxury experiences offered by Hilton as unique SLH properties join the unparalleled hotels of the growing Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and LXR brands.\n\nSLH hotels participating in the exclusive partnership with Hilton have seen significant performance increases since the partnership began. Traffic to SLH properties via Hilton's digital booking channels has risen notably, increasing 78% year-over-year in July.\n\n### Placemakr Partnership\nThe new brand will launch in partnership with Placemakr, a company specializing in flexible, short-term and extended-stay accommodations. The partnership with Placemakr is expected to add approximately 3,000 new units to Hilton's existing inventory of about 10,000 apartment-style accommodations globally.\n\n### Regional Partnerships\nIn November, it signed a landmark strategic licensing agreement with Olive by Embassy to bring 150 Spark by Hilton hotels to the country, marking the debut of the brand into Asia Pacific.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Q4 2025 Earnings Announcement\nHilton will report fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial results before the stock market opens on Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026, followed by a conference call at 9 a.m. EST.\n\n### Minneapolis Franchise Controversy (January 2026)\nHilton announced that it was ending its relationship with an independently owned Minneapolis-area hotel after a newly released video appeared to confirm that the property was refusing to accommodate ICE agents. \"As such, we are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems. Hilton is — and has always been — a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system\".\n\n### Share Repurchase Program\nHilton announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $3.5 billion increase in the amount available for repurchases of common stock under Hilton's existing stock repurchase program, bringing the total amount currently authorized for future repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion.\n\n### 9,000th Property Milestone\nIn October 2025, reached our 9,000th property milestone with the opening of the Signia by Hilton La Cantera.\n\n### Workplace Recognition\nHilton ranks No. 1 on the 2025 World's 25 Best Workplaces list. Named as the No. 1 World's Best Workplace by Great Place to Work and Fortune.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: **8.2/10** (Strong Buy)\n\n**Rationale:**\nHilton demonstrates exceptional strategic positioning with its asset-light business model generating consistent cash flows and strong margins. The company's global expansion, particularly in high-growth Asia Pacific markets, positions it well for long-term growth. The successful SLH partnership and new brand launches (Outset Collection, Apartment Collection) show innovative product development. Strong brand value ($15.1B, up 30%) and the fastest-growing major loyalty program (210M members) provide competitive moats.\n\n**Key Positives:**\n- Asset-light model with 80%+ fee-based revenue\n- Record development pipeline (515K+ rooms)\n- Strong market position (#2 globally by market cap)\n- Innovative brand portfolio expansion\n- Excellent workplace culture (#1 Best Workplace)\n- Robust financial performance despite headwinds\n\n**Key Concerns:**\n- China market challenges (RevPAR down 3.1%)\n- Soft business travel recovery\n- High valuation (P/E 43.6)\n- Exposure to macroeconomic cycles\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: **$315-$325**\n\nBased on:\n- Forward P/E of ~30x (premium to historical due to growth initiatives)\n- 2025E EPS of $8.02 (midpoint of guidance)\n- DCF analysis incorporating strong cash generation and growth prospects\n- Premium valuation justified by asset-light model and global expansion potential\n- Current analyst price target range supports $290-$340 valuations\n\n**Investment Thesis:** Hilton's combination of defensive asset-light business model, aggressive global expansion (especially Asia Pacific), innovative brand development, and strong operational execution makes it an attractive long-term growth story despite near-term RevPAR headwinds. The company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term travel industry recovery and emerging market growth.",

(NASDAQ: CSV) is a leading provider of deathcare products and services in the United States, operating as a consolidator in the fragmented funeral and cemetery industry. Founded in 1991 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company owns and operates 170 funeral homes and 34 cemeteries across 27 states, serving diverse markets from urban centers to rural areas. CSV's business model emphasizes high-value merchandise sales (e.g., caskets, urns), preneed sales (pre-planned funerals/cemeteries), and cemetery endowments, generating stable, recession-resistant revenue streams due to the inevitability of deathcare demand. The company focuses on strategic acquisitions of underperforming assets, operational improvements via its \"High Trust, Low Cost\" model, and same-store growth through enhanced merchandising and digital marketing. With a market capitalization of approximately $526 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance), CSV reported total revenue of $95.4 million in Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), up 7.6% YoY, driven by acquisition contributions and a 2.2% same-store revenue increase. Net income was $10.3 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, with gross profit margins at 34.7%. The firm benefits from demographic tailwinds like aging Baby Boomers but faces headwinds from cremation trends eroding traditional embalming services. CSV differentiates through family-owned branding, flexible pricing, and a robust preneed backlog exceeding $500 million.

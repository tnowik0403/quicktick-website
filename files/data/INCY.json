Founded in 1991, Incyte has built a portfolio anchored by its blockbuster JAK inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib), approved for myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and other indications. The company generates nearly all revenue from the U.S. market via Jakafi and expanding dermatology asset Opzelura (ruxolitinib cream), while partnering ex-U.S. rights (e.g., Novartis for Jakavi). \n\nIncyte's strategy emphasizes internal R&D with ~2,500 employees, focusing on precision oncology (e.g., FGFR inhibitors like Pemazyre), ITK inhibitors for inflammation, and novel modalities like PROTACs. Q3 2024 revenue hit $1.08 billion (up 2% YoY), driven by Jakafi's 11% growth to $759.4 million, per Oct 29, 2024 earnings release. GAAP net income was $221.4 million (EPS $0.98). With $3.7 billion in cash (no debt), Incyte supports a robust pipeline (20+ programs), label expansions, and $1 billion+ annual buybacks. Despite looming Jakafi patent cliffs (U.S. exclusivity to 2028), Incyte targets $4 billion+ peak Opzelura sales and oncology diversification. Sector tailwinds in immuno-oncology contrast biosimilar pressures, positioning Incyte for mid-single-digit growth amid biotech volatility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 29, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings – Total revenue $1.08B (+2% YoY); Jakafi $759.4M (+11%); Opzelura $70.2M (+92%); GAAP net income $221.4M (EPS $0.98).

Strong Jakafi/Opzelura momentum offsets patent risk; pipeline catalysts (axatilimab 2025) drive 20%+ upside. Moderate risk via cash buffer, but cliff looms.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $78 (26% upside from $61.72). DCF-based (5% revenue CAGR to 2028, 3% terminal; 10% WACC; per Q3 fundamentals + Leerink PTs). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns.",

(NYSE: BFH), headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, is a tech-enabled financial services company specializing in consumer lending and marketing solutions. Formerly Alliance Data Systems, it rebranded in 2023 after spinning off its loyalty business (Ennoble) and focusing on its core credit card and financing operations through Comenity Direct and Comenity Capital Bank. BFH issues private-label and co-branded credit cards, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) options, and deposit products, partnering with over 150 retailers across apparel, sporting goods, home improvement, and travel sectors. Its portfolio emphasizes high-yield credit cards for underserved consumers, generating revenue primarily from interchange fees (35-40%), interest income (50-55%), and servicing fees.\n\nWith $24.1 billion in credit card receivables as of Q2 2024, BFH targets middle-market consumers with credit scores often below prime (average FICO ~680). It leverages data analytics for personalized marketing, fraud detection, and risk management via proprietary platforms like Total System Services integration. The company serves ~65 million active accounts, emphasizing digital origination (90%+ online) and omnichannel experiences. Recent strategic shifts include deposit growth via Bread Savings (high-yield savings/CDs) to fund lending organically, reducing reliance on securitizations amid rising rates. BFH's model thrives on retailer partnerships, driving 20-25% of U.S. private-label card spend in key verticals, but faces cyclical credit risks in a high-delinquency environment.

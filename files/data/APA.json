Existing Products/Services\n\nAPA's core operations focus on oil and natural gas exploration and production across multiple geographic regions. In the United States, the company operates primarily in the Permian Basin, which represents its largest production area. The company also maintains significant operations in Egypt's Western Desert, where it produces both oil and gas, with a growing focus on natural gas development. In the North Sea, APA operates offshore assets in the United Kingdom. The company's production portfolio includes conventional and unconventional resources, with APA Corporation maintained stable production at 413 MBOE/d in Q3 2025, closely matching prior quarters and last year's levels.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nAPA has several major development projects underway. The most significant is the GranMorgu project will produce oil from the Krabdagu and Sapakara oil discoveries, where appraisal drilling confirmed gross estimated recoverable resources of more than 750 million barrels. The fields, located in water depths between 100 and 1,000 meters, will be produced through a system of subsea wells connected to a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit located 150 kilometers off the coast, with an oil production capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. Total investment is estimated at $10.5 billion, with first oil in 2028. In Alaska, the company announced significant discoveries at the Sockeye-2 exploratory well, which encountered a high-quality reservoir with approximately 25 feet of net oil pay. Subsequent to the first quarter, the company conducted a successful flow test which indicated significantly higher reservoir quality compared to similar discoveries to the west. Technical evaluation is under way to determine next steps for appraisal and further exploration.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAPA's growth strategy centers on disciplined capital allocation and operational efficiency. Our mindset going into 2026 is focused on capital discipline. In closing, as we enter 2026, our priorities remain centered on disciplined capital allocation, further cost reductions, and continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. Our development capital, inclusive of approximately $250 million for Suriname development, is expected to be 10% lower than 2025, reflecting improved capital efficiency across our portfolio. This preliminary plan positions APA to sustain Permian oil production, deliver continued gas growth in Egypt, and advance the world-class opportunity we're developing in Suriname Block 58. Together with our ongoing focus on reducing controllable spend, these actions further strengthen our foundation for durable free cash flow generation and long-term value creation. The company is implementing aggressive cost reduction initiatives, with the company now expects to achieve run-rate savings of $350 million by the end of 2025, two years sooner than originally anticipated. APA expects to recognize an additional $50 million to $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of 2026, spanning across development capital, LOE, and G&A.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAs an upstream oil and gas producer, APA's primary clients are oil and gas purchasers, refiners, and marketing companies. The company sells its production to various third-party purchasers in the markets where it operates. In Egypt, APA has arrangements with the Egyptian government and state-owned entities for gas sales. For the GranMorgu project in Suriname, the company will likely enter into offtake agreements with major international oil traders and refiners when production begins in 2028.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nAPA reported net income attributable to common stock of $205 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. When adjusted for items that impact the comparability of results, APA's adjusted earnings were $332 million, or $0.93 per diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDAX was $1.3 billion. APA Corporation exceeded Q3 2025 estimates with EPS of $0.93 (17.72% above forecast) and revenue of $2.12 billion, driving an 8.03% stock surge to $23.22 in after-hours trading. The company reported $332 million in adjusted net income, $205 million in consolidated net income, and generated $339 million in free cash flow while reducing net debt by approximately $430 million. In 2024, APA Corporation's revenue was $9.47 billion, an increase of 16.45% compared to the previous year's $8.13 billion. Earnings were $804.00 million, a decrease of -71.84%. During the third quarter, APA reduced its net debt by approximately $430 million, driven by a combination of free cash flow generation and payments from Egypt. The company has reduced its net debt by nearly $2.3 billion since the third quarter of 2024, with a current net debt balance of roughly $4.0 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Strong operational performance in the Permian Basin and Egypt regions contributed to results, with the company ahead of schedule in realizing $300 million in cost savings this year. APA plans to invest $1.3 billion in Permian development capital in 2026 and targets additional cost savings of $50-100 million by end-2026, with minimal U.S. cash taxes expected in 2025-2026. CEO John Christmann highlighted the company's successful strategy implementation, noting momentum in cost savings and potential for year-over-year growth in gas production.\n- The GranMorgu project represents a major growth catalyst with first oil expected in 2028\n- Accelerated cost savings program ahead of schedule\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Volatile commodity prices could impact revenue and profitability. Regulatory changes in key markets may affect operations. Potential delays in project timelines, such as the Suriname project. Geopolitical instability in regions like Egypt could pose operational risks.\n- APA curtailed approximately 91 MMcf/d of natural gas production due to weak Waha hub prices.\n- Asset retirement obligations and decommissioning costs in the North Sea\n- Exposure to commodity price volatility\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWhile several other companies could be considered, including Apache Corporation (APA), which had approximately 328,000 Boepd in the Permian in 3Q24, APA holds a smaller position compared to major Permian producers. In Egypt's Western Desert, APA is one of the significant international operators alongside other IOCs. The company's market position is considered mid-tier among independent oil and gas producers globally.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nAPA competes with major independent oil and gas companies including EOG Resources, Diamondback Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Devon Energy. ConocoPhillips quarterly revenues are $14B, which are larger than APA Corp. quarterly revenues of $2.2B. ConocoPhillips's net income of $2B is higher than APA Corp.'s net income of $665M. Notably, ConocoPhillips's price-to-earnings ratio is 12.35x while APA Corp.'s PE ratio is 7.90x. Due to their significant success and substantial ownership of Permian production, the trioFANG, OXY, and EOGis one of the most powerful domestic players in the Permian Basin. They stand alongside super-major oil companies like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which, by the way, recently acquired Pioneer Resources, becoming the number one US producer by far. APA's valuation metrics suggest it trades at a discount to larger peers, potentially offering value for investors.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nAPA's most significant partnership is with TotalEnergies to explore and develop Block 58. In December 2019, APA entered into a joint venture with TotalEnergies to explore and develop Block 58. TotalEnergies EP Suriname B.V. is the operator of Block 58, with a 50% interest, alongside APA Suriname 58 Corporation LDC (50%). APA Corporation's (NASDAQ: APA) $4.5 billion all-stock acquisition of Callon Petroleum (NYSE: CPE) in April, providing additional scale across the Permian Basin. The company also has partnerships in Alaska with Lagniappe Alaska, LLC, an Armstrong company, and Oil Search (Alaska), LLC, a subsidiary of Santos Limited for exploration activities.\n\n## 12.

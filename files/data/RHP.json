(RHP) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) focused exclusively on owning, leasing, and operating upscale, convention center resorts in the United States. Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, RHP dominates the group and convention segment of the hospitality industry through its flagship Gaylord Hotels brand, which comprises seven large-scale properties strategically located in high-demand convention markets: Nashville, Opryland (Nashville), Orlando, National Harbor (Maryland), Washington D.C., Rocky Mountain (Aurora, CO), and Texan (Grapevine, TX). These properties offer over 15,000 rooms, extensive meeting space (more than 3 million sq ft), and integrated resort amenities like ballrooms, atriums, dining, and entertainment. \n\nPost its strategic pivot in October 2023, when it sold its Opry Entertainment Group assets (including the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium) to Blackstone for $674 million, RHP has become a pure-play lodging REIT emphasizing convention-driven demand. The company's portfolio benefits from long-term operating leases with Marriott International (for Gaylord Hotels) and high barriers to entry due to its scale and prime locations near convention centers. RHP generates revenue primarily from room revenue (55-60%), food & beverage (25-30%), and other services tied to group bookings. With a focus on RevPAR growth from convention traffic, RHP reported record occupancy in Q2 2024, positioning it for sustained outperformance in a recovering travel market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 18, 2024**: Announced definitive agreement to acquire the 1,907-room New York Marriott Marquis (NYMM) convention hotel in Times Square, NYC, for $785 million from Host Hotels & Resorts (HST).

Convention segment RevPAR expected +4-6% CAGR vs. industry +3%.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (Q2 2024 unless noted) | RHP | Host Hotels (HST) | Pebblebrook (PEB) | DiamondRock (DRH) |\n|-------------------------------|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **RevPAR Growth YoY** | +3.1% | +1.8% | -0.5% | +2.2% |\n| **Occupancy** | 89.4% | 68.5% | 65.2% | 72.1% |\n| **Group Revenue %** | 70% | 35% | 25% | 40% |\n| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | 4.8x | 3.2x | 5.5x | 3.9x |\n| **YTD Total Return** | +12% | +8% | -5% | +6% |\n\n*RHP outperforms on convention focus; less cyclical than urban/transient peers.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships**: Marriott International (operator/lessee for 6/7 properties); Gaylord brand licensing.\n- **Recent M&A**: NYMM buy from HST ($785M, Sep 2024); Opry sale to Blackstone (Oct 2023).\n- **Major Clients**: Conventions/groups (e.g., American Legion, NAB, SEMA); 2024 booked business +12% YoY.

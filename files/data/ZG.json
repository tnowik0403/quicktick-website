Daily Volume:** 1.72 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nZillow Group, Inc. (ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace, operating a portfolio of consumer-facing brands including Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy (NYC rentals), and HotPads. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Seattle, WA, Zillow connects home buyers, sellers, renters, and real estate professionals through its platforms, which attract over 200 million monthly unique users (Q2 2024 data). Core revenue (95%+) comes from the Residential segment, primarily Premier Agent advertising where agents pay for customer connections via zip-code subscriptions and cost-per-lead models. Additional streams include Rentals (listings and applications) and Mortgages (originations and advertising referrals). Zillow pioneered the Zestimate® valuation tool (AI-powered home price estimates) and offers ancillary services like 3D home tours, moving concierge, and title services. Unlike agent-light competitors, Zillow's model emphasizes high-margin agent monetization amid a fragmented $2 trillion U.S. residential real estate market. The company exited iBuying (instant offers) in November 2021 after $881 million losses, refocusing on scalable tech platforms. With 5,000+ employees, Zillow holds dominant online traffic share but faces cyclical housing headwinds.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024):** Total revenue $528 million (+13% YoY); Premier Agent revenue $462 million (+17% YoY); Rentals revenue $51 million (+13% YoY); Mortgages revenue $10 million (-9% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $72 million (vs. $54 million YoY).

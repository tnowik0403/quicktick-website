Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, Lennar designs, builds, and sells single-family homes, townhomes, condos, and multifamily rental properties across 26 states, with a focus on high-growth markets like Florida, Texas, California, and the Carolinas. The company operates through four segments: Homebuilding (core revenue driver, ~95% of sales), Financial Services (mortgage origination and title services), Multifamily (rental apartments), and Commercial (mixed-use developments). Lennar's \"Everything's Connected\" platform integrates vertical operations, including land development, manufacturing (e.g., trusses, cabinets via Innovative Construction Group or LGI), digital sales tools, and tech like Wi-Fi Certified homes and its proprietary LEN CONNECT platform for smart home integration. In FY2023, Lennar delivered ~68,000 homes, generating $34.2B in revenue. The company emphasizes affordability through smaller homes (Everything's Built on Value initiative), multistory urban formats, and forward land commitments to control costs amid housing shortages estimated at 4-7M units nationally. LEN.B shares (Class B, non-voting) trade at a ~10-15% discount to Class A (LEN) due to lower liquidity.

(OBIO) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of multispecific antibody therapeutics targeting key cytokines implicated in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Orion leverages its proprietary OBI™ platform to engineer bispecific antibodies that simultaneously inhibit multiple inflammatory pathways, aiming for superior efficacy and safety over existing monoclonals. The lead candidate, OB-007, is a first-in-class IL-23/IL-17A/F bispecific antibody in Phase 2 for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Additional preclinical assets include OB-001 (IL-4/IL-13 bispecific) for atopic dermatitis and asthma, and earlier-stage programs targeting TSLP/IL-13 and undisclosed cytokines.  \n\nOrion went public via NASDAQ IPO on July 15, 2024, raising $50 million at $5/share (upsized from $4), providing runway into H2 2026. As a pure-play immunology biotech, Orion focuses on high-unmet-need indications in gastroenterology and dermatology, where IL-23/IL-17 inhibition has blockbuster precedents (e.g., Stelara, Cosentyx sales >$10B combined in 2023). With no approved products yet, Orion is pre-revenue, emphasizing clinical milestones over commercialization. The company reported $88.7 million in cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024 (post-IPO infusion), with R&D expenses of $6.2 million in Q2 2024 (up 25% QoQ due to OB-007 trial ramp-up). Orion's strategy positions it in the $50B+ global autoimmune market, growing at 8-10% CAGR amid biologics shift.

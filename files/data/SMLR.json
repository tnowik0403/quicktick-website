(SMLR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq real-time data):**  \n- **Stock Price**: $42.85  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $302.4 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $18.22 - $47.25  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 284,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSemler Scientific, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMLR) is a medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative products and services that aid healthcare providers in the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases, particularly peripheral artery disease (PAD) and type 2 diabetes. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, the company gained prominence with its flagship product, QuantaFlo®—a patented, FDA-cleared, point-of-care blood flow measurement device that uses a patented waveform analysis algorithm and disposable testing components. QuantaFlo enables rapid (under 60 seconds), non-invasive PAD screening using a blood pressure cuff and smartphone/tablet, targeting primary care physicians, cardiologists, podiatrists, and internists.  \n\nHistorically, Semler shifted from a traditional medical device sales model to a SaaS-like subscription model via Early Detection and Referral Tracking (EDRT™) software, which integrates QuantaFlo testing with patient tracking and revenue cycle management. In recent years, core healthcare revenues have declined amid market saturation and competition, prompting a pivot. On May 28, 2024, Semler announced a transformative Bitcoin treasury strategy, adopting BTC as its primary treasury reserve asset to maximize long-term shareholder value, similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR). As of October 8, 2024, the company holds 3,600 BTC (acquired at an average cost of ~$43,000 per BTC, total cost basis ~$156 million), representing ~73% of its market cap value at current BTC prices (~$62,500). This shift has driven stock volatility tied to crypto markets, overshadowing its medtech roots. Semler employs ~50 people and operates with minimal debt, emphasizing capital efficiency.

Ideal for moderate risk (volatility ~80% ann.) seeking 50%+ upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $60/share (40% upside) – DCF on BTC holdings at $90K target (base case, per Ark Invest Oct 2024) + $10/share terminal medtech value; bull $90 ($150K BTC); bear $25 ($40K BTC).",

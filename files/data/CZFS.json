Trading at 4.5% discount to $70 deal price amid low breakup risk (superior proposal unlikely in small-cap space). Moderate risk from regulatory delays (e.g., similar to WesBanco deal extensions).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $70.00 (deal price; 5% upside from $66.82). For growth upside/moderate risk portfolio: Attractive arb with 6-12 month horizon, annualized return ~8-10% if closes H1 2025 (factoring 1.9% dividend). Upside to $75 if competing bid emerges; downside to $55 on deal break.",

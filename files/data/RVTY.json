(formerly PerkinElmer until rebranding in 2023) is a global provider of intelligent systems, reagents, consumables, software, and services enabling scientists and clinicians to address complex challenges in life sciences, diagnostics, and discovery. Operating through two main segments—Discovery & Analytical Solutions (DAS, ~55% of revenue) and Diagnostics (~45%)—the company supports drug discovery, development, reproductive health, infectious disease testing, oncology, and genetic screening. DAS offers high-content screening, cellular imaging, genomics, and mass spectrometry tools, while Diagnostics provides newborn screening, immunoassays, and molecular diagnostics platforms like the chemagic sequencer. Headquartered in Waltham, MA, Revvity serves pharmaceutical/biotech (pharma services ~30% revenue), academic/government labs, and clinical customers worldwide, with ~11,000 employees across 30+ countries. Post-2022 spin-off of its environmental testing business (now Revelyst), Revvity sharpened focus on high-growth health sciences, leveraging AI-driven informatics (e.g., Revvity Signals® suite) for data analysis in precision medicine. In FY2023, it generated $2.77B revenue, emphasizing recurring consumables (70%+ of DAS revenue) for stable growth amid a $100B+ addressable market in life sciences tools and diagnostics.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q): Adjusted revenue $692.7M (-1% YoY organic, impacted by COVID test decline); GAAP revenue $678.1M (-12% YoY); Adjusted EPS $1.12 (beat consensus $1.07); DAS revenue $385M (+3% YoY); Diagnostics $308M (-7% YoY, post-COVID normalization).

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**: \n• The company reported $1.18 earnings per share for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $1.14 by $0.04. The business had revenue of $698.95 million for the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $699.75 million.\n• The company's revenue was up 2.2% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n**Q4 2025 Preliminary Results**:\n• Preliminary expectations indicate reported revenue growth of approximately 6% for the fourth quarter to approximately $772 million, compared to the consensus of $760.6 million, with full-year revenue projected to reach around $2.855 billion, reflecting a growth rate of about 4% year-over-year compared to the consensus of $2.84 billion.\n• Revvity expects its 2025 adjusted earnings per share to exceed the upper end of its previous guidance of $4.90 to $5.00.\n\n**Annual Performance**: In 2024, Revvity's revenue was $2.76 billion, an increase of 0.16% compared to the previous year's $2.75 billion. Earnings were $270.39 million, a decrease of -60.99%.\n\n**Financial Health**: The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.36, a current ratio of 1.75 and a quick ratio of 1.44. Revvity had a net margin of 8.44% and a return on equity of 7.52%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds**:\n• Strong diagnostic trends in the United States and Europe are positive, Revvity is navigating challenges in China's diagnostics market due to recent reimbursement policy changes impacting demand for higher-value products.\n• Tariffs and FX are creating 60 basis points of margin headwind in 2025\n• Revvity has lagged the broader market over the past year due to weak underlying growth and deteriorating profitability. Its constant-currency revenue growth has averaged just 2% over the last two years, signaling soft demand and underperformance compared to peers. At the same time, profitability has come under pressure, with adjusted operating margin declining by more than 9 percentage points over the past five years, reflecting higher costs and limited operating leverage. These challenges have translated into declining financial performance, as both revenue and EPS have fallen annually over the past five years.\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n• The Q3 2025 launch of Signals One, a reimagined core data platform with AI capabilities, demonstrates continuous innovation that deepens customer relationships. More importantly, the software creates synergies with the Life Sciences Solutions franchise—customers who adopt Signals for data management are more likely to standardize on Revvity's instruments and reagents, creating a virtuous cycle that competitors selling point solutions cannot replicate.\n• Revvity has deployed \"Revvity AI\" across all 11,000 employees, with over 30 custom AI agents driving measurable efficiency gains. Sales reps see three to four times improvement in lead generation conversion, while software development timelines shrink 5-10%. In finance, AI agents have an \"immediate and material impact on collections.\"\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket share specifics are not provided in the data. However, While smaller than Thermo Fisher and Danaher, Revvity's integrated software-hardware workflows and leadership in newborn screening create defensible moats in specialized diagnostics, though growth lags larger peers' 3-10% organic rates. With 1,493 patents as of July 2025, Revvity possesses a strong intellectual property portfolio that acts as a barrier to entry for competitors.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors**: In the life sciences segment, the company competes with Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Agilent Technologies (A), and Danaher Corporation (DHR) in areas such as analytical instrumentation, imaging systems, and laboratory automation. These competitors offer similar high-content screening platforms, liquid handling systems, and detection technologies targeting pharmaceutical and biotechnology research applications. In the diagnostics segment, Revvity faces competition from Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Roche Holding, and Siemens Healthineers in newborn screening, prenatal testing, and infectious disease diagnostics.\n\n**Competitive Position**: At $104.41 per share, Revvity trades at 53.8x trailing earnings and 24.4x free cash flow, a significant premium to life sciences peers. Thermo Fisher (TMO) trades at 34.1x earnings and 36.3x free cash flow, while Danaher (DHR) trades at 46.8x earnings and 32.4x free cash flow. This matters because Revvity's higher P/E reflects lower absolute earnings due to transformation costs and tariff headwinds, while its lower P/FCF multiple suggests the market recognizes the quality of its cash generation.\n\n## 11.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus**: The 14 analysts that cover Revvity stock have a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and an average price target of $117.43, which forecasts a 26.61% increase in the stock price over the next year. Revvity has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy which is based on 6 buy ratings, 5 hold ratings and 0 sell ratings. The average price target is $110.88 with a high forecast of $123.00 and a low forecast of $100.00.\n\n**Current Valuation Concerns**: With earnings momentum weakening and the stock still trading at a relatively full valuation, investors have remained cautious, leading RVTY to trail the broader market. While the stock trades at a premium P/E multiple, the strong consensus and 8% expected earnings growth suggest analysts view this growth as justification for the 9% upside to analyst targets.\n\n**Investment Strengths**:\n• Strong AI integration strategy with comprehensive deployment across operations\n• High-growth Signals software platform with 20% organic growth and 40%+ recurring revenue\n• Strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly\n• Leadership position in specialized diagnostics niches\n• Strong patent portfolio (1,493 patents) creating competitive barriers\n\n**Investment Risks**:\n• Premium valuation relative to peers\n• China market headwinds affecting immunodiagnostics\n• Slower organic growth compared to larger life sciences competitors\n• Historical margin compression pressures\n\n**Buy Rating: 6.8/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $108-115**\n\nThe rating reflects Revvity's transformation story and AI-driven growth initiatives, particularly the high-growth Signals software platform. However, the premium valuation, margin pressures, and geographic headwinds limit the upside potential. The stock appears fairly valued in the current range, with modest upside if AI initiatives and strategic partnerships accelerate growth beyond current expectations. For growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance, the company offers exposure to AI-enhanced life sciences workflows, but investors should monitor execution on margin expansion targets and resolution of China market challenges.",

Headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, Cigna operates through two primary segments: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth, which accounts for ~80% of revenues, provides pharmacy benefit management (PBM) via Express Scripts, specialty pharmacy, home delivery, and care delivery services including provider engagement and health analytics. Cigna Healthcare focuses on U.S. employer, government (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), and international health plans, alongside dental, vision, behavioral health, and medical coverage for ~16 million medical members.\n\nCigna emphasizes value-based care, digital health innovations, and integrated services to drive affordability and outcomes. Key strengths include its dominant PBM scale (handling 1.6 billion+ annual prescriptions), AI-powered tools for prior authorizations and claims, and partnerships like VillageMD for primary care. The company has transformed post-2018 Express Scripts acquisition, shifting from pure insurance toward services-led growth amid U.S. healthcare cost pressures. With 2023 revenues of $195.3 billion and a focus on 5-10% annual adjusted EPS growth through 2025, Cigna targets mid-teens ROE while navigating regulatory scrutiny on PBMs and medical loss ratios (MLR). Its diversified model mitigates employer-sponsored insurance volatility, positioning it for tailwinds in pharmacy spend growth and chronic care management.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 25, 2024)**: Revenues $57.9B (vs. $58.4B est.), adjusted EPS $6.86 (beat $6.78 est.), adjusted income from operations $2.7B (up 9% YoY).

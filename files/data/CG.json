(CG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: October 10, 2024*  \n*Data Sources: Verified from Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Carlyle Investor Relations, SEC filings (8-K/Q2 10-Q dated August 6, 2024), Seeking Alpha transcripts, Reuters, WSJ articles (latest as of Oct 9, 2024). All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 earnings (reported Aug 6, 2024, covering period ended June 30, 2024; <6 months old). Stock price/market cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq close Oct 10, 2024.*\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nThe Carlyle Group Inc. (NYSE: CG) is a leading global alternative asset manager founded in 1987, headquartered in Washington, D.C., with ~2,800 employees across 28 offices worldwide. It manages approximately $447 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of June 30, 2024, spanning private equity (PE), private credit, infrastructure, real assets, and investment solutions. Carlyle operates three core segments: Global Private Equity (40% of fee-earning AUM), Global Credit (35%), and Global Investment Solutions (25%), targeting mid-market and large-cap opportunities in North America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets.  \n\nThe firm emphasizes perpetual capital vehicles like evergreen funds and partnerships with insurers to drive stable fee-related earnings (FRE). In Q2 2024, Carlyle deployed $16.2B and raised $11.7B across strategies, highlighting fundraising strength amid market volatility. Revenue is derived from management/performance fees (80%), principal investment gains, and insurance solutions via Fortitude Re (a Bermuda-based reinsurer). Carlyle differentiates through sector expertise in aerospace/defense, industrials, consumer, and tech-enabled services, with a focus on operational improvements post-acquisition. As a publicly traded partnership converted to C-Corp in 2023, it offers a 3.5% dividend yield, appealing to income-growth investors. Challenges include fundraising slowdowns from high rates, but tailwinds from PE dry powder ($447B globally) position it for recovery.\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Q2 2024 Verified Metrics)\n| Metric                  | Q2 2024 Value | QoQ Change | YoY Change | Notes/Source |\n|-------------------------|---------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Fee-Related Earnings   | $235M        | +12%      | +26%      | Record high; Carlyle IR |\n| Distributable Earnings | $263M        | +5%       | -20%      | Ex-auto business sale impact |\n| Revenue                | $1.1B        | +10%      | +5%       | Incl. management fees $723M |\n| Gross Margin (Adj.)    | 45%          | Stable    | +2 pts    | Fee-driven |\n| AUM                    | $447B        | +6%       | +12%      | Driven by $34B fundraising YTD |\n| Fee-Earning AUM        | $195B        | +4%       | +14%      | Dry powder $37B |\n\n*Stock Price (Oct 10 close): $48.82 | Market Cap: $17.41B | 52-Wk Range: $30.37–$50.50 | Dividend Yield: 3.53% (fwd $1.72/share).*\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 6, 2024**: Q2 earnings beat expectations; raised 2024 DE guidance to $1.10–$1.16/share (prior $1.00–$1.10).

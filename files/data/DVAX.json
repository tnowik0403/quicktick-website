Daily Volume**: 1.84 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nDynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX) is a commercial-stage immunology company specializing in the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel vaccines leveraging its proprietary Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist platform, particularly the CpG 1018 adjuvant. Headquartered in Emeryville, California, the company focuses on vaccines for serious infectious diseases, with its flagship product HEPLISAV-B® (hepatitis B vaccine, recombinant) approved by the FDA in 2017 for adults 18+ as a two-dose regimen offering higher seroprotection rates than traditional three-dose vaccines. HEPLISAV-B generated $260.4 million in U.S. net product sales in 2023, driving commercialization efforts through a targeted sales force emphasizing high-risk adult populations (e.g., those with diabetes, CKD, healthcare workers).\n\nDynavax's revenue is bolstered by milestone payments and royalties from licensing its CpG 1018 adjuvant to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for SHINGRIX®, the world's leading shingles vaccine with over $11 billion in global sales in 2023. SHINGRIX incorporates CpG 1018 to enhance immune response in older adults. The company maintains a lean operation with ~500 employees, a strong balance sheet ($765 million cash as of Q2 2024), and no debt, enabling pipeline investment. Dynavax's strategy emphasizes U.S. market dominance in adult Hep B vaccination (amid rising incidence linked to obesity/diabetes), international expansion, and adjuvant licensing for combo vaccines. Challenges include competition from entrenched three-dose vaccines and payer dynamics, but tailwinds from CDC recommendations and adjuvant royalties position it for multi-year growth.

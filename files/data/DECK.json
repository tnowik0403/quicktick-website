Company Overview (DECK) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1.

The company operates through several key segments: UGG Brand, HOKA Brand, Teva Brand, Sanuk Brand, and Direct-to-Consumer. Founded in 1973 and headquartered in Goleta, California, Deckers has evolved from a simple flip-flop maker into a global leader in premium footwear.\n\nThe company markets its products through international distributors, direct to consumer (DTC) business, domestic and international retailers and e-commerce websites. It operates retail stores in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US, and Vietnam.

Existing Products/Services\n\n### UGG Brand\nThe UGG Brand segment offers a line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories. The brand's 365 strategy broadened its appeal beyond cold-weather items, with sandals, sneakers, and men's footwear gaining traction. In fiscal 2025, UGG accounted for 51% of total sales.\n\n### HOKA Brand\nThe HOKA Brand segment sells footwear and apparel that offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight, originally designed for ultra-runners. HOKA accounted for 45% of total sales in fiscal 2025. The brand is distinguished by the shock-absorbing thick, curved sole of some of its staple models.\n\n### Other Brands\nThe Teva Brand segment focuses on the sport sandal and modern outdoor lifestyle category, while the Sanuk Brand segment originated in Southern California surf culture and has emerged into a lifestyle brand with a presence in the relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nUpcoming launches of Gaviota, Mach, and Speedgoat franchises in Spring '26, along with lower-profile solutions like Solimar and Transport, show a product pipeline that can capture both performance and lifestyle consumers. HOKA maintained momentum with updated models like the Bondi 9 and Clifton 10.\n\nUGG will be launching its iconic design campaign to build heat and generate buzz for versatile footwear in advance for UGG season with activation planned in key cities around the world, leveraging its iconic mustard seat colorway on key styles, including the Lowmel Sneaker, Uggbraid clog and all-new Classic Micro.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n\"HOKA and UGG again delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter, reflecting strong performance and international momentum for these powerful brands,\" said Stefano Caroti, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our brands' ability to connect with consumers through leading innovative products differentiates Deckers in today's dynamic and competitive marketplace.\"\n\nManagement expects international markets to consistently outpace U.S. growth. HOKA is positioned as the fastest-growing brand, while UGG builds on its expanding seasonal and demographic reach. With an ambition to lift international sales toward 50% of total revenues, Deckers is creating a more globally balanced and resilient business model.\n\nDeckers' continued push into higher margin direct to consumer channels, including selective retail partnerships such as UGG's experiential presence at Urban Outfitters' On Rotation concept aligns closely with whether stronger DTC and elevated full price selling can offset tariff impacts and keep the UGG and HOKA growth story intact.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nDeckers produces most of its sales through wholesale partnerships but also operates e-commerce in more than 50 countries and has nearly 200 company-operated stores. To support rising demand, Deckers invested in infrastructure, including opening stores in Berlin, Milan, and cities in China.\n\nSwiss brand On Running has expanded its wholesale presence through high street stockists including footwear retailer Office and Frasers Group's Sports Direct, indicating the competitive landscape for retail partnerships.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Earnings Performance\nFor Q2 2026, Deckers reported diluted earnings per share of $1.82 compared to $1.59 in the prior year, beating analyst expectations of $1.58 by 15.19%. The next earnings report is scheduled for January 29, 2026.\n\n### Revenue Growth\nDeckers Outdoor revenue for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025 was $5.244B, a 12.62% increase year-over-year. Annual revenue for 2025 was $4.986B, a 16.28% increase from 2024, which was $4.288B. In 2024, Deckers Outdoor's revenue was $4.99 billion, an increase of 16.28% compared to the previous year. Earnings were $966.09 million, an increase of 27.19%.\n\n### Balance Sheet Strength\nCash and cash equivalents were $1.414 billion with no outstanding borrowings. During the second fiscal quarter, the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $282.0 million at a weighted average price of $109.31, with approximately $2.2 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nThe 20-40% tariff era on Vietnamese exports has forced Deckers to accelerate its supply chain diversification. While the company has moved some production to other regions, the specialized machinery required for HOKA's complex midsoles makes a rapid exit from Vietnam difficult.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2026, Deckers anticipates a more cautious revenue performance, reflecting the impacts of higher tariffs, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and a more measured U.S. consumer environment. The gross margin is expected to be 56%, suggesting tariff-related headwinds.\n\n### Tailwinds\nDeckers Outdoor shares increased by 5.3% after President Trump announced the cancellation of tariffs on European countries, positively affecting the apparel and footwear sector.\n\nThe first half of fiscal 2026 shows continued momentum despite macro headwinds. Total company revenue grew 12%, with HOKA up 15% and UGG up 12%. International regions were the primary growth driver, with revenue increasing 38% year-over-year.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nHOKA's market share increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 0.7% in 2022, while On Running quadrupled from 0.3% to 1.2% in the same period. Competition in footwear is heating up as established leaders Nike and Adidas are beginning to lose market share to newer competition such as On and Deckers, with legacy brands now facing more newcomers as HOKA brand and On Running increasingly eat up more market share.\n\nDeckers transformed its HOKA brand into a running and athletic footwear powerhouse, eating away market share from Nike and Adidas. The company's margins were aided by full-price sales of HOKA running shoes.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. Nike\nStrong demand for HOKA boosted Deckers' total sales by 21% through the first half of the year. The shoe specialist generates a small portion of sales from overseas markets, so foreign currency fluctuation isn't pressuring Deckers as much as Nike. The success of HOKA has made Deckers a more diversified and stronger business.\n\nThe footwear company grew its revenue by an average of 19% and its GAAP earnings per share by 32% between its FY21 and FY25. DECK is trading 15% below its industry, 50% under Nike, and 35% below the S&P 500 despite blowing them all away.\n\n### Market Position\nCrocs, Salvatore Ferragamo, VF, Adidas, and Puma are some of the 38 competitors of Deckers Outdoor. Nike's strengths lie in its strong brand equity, innovative product line, and extensive global reach.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe story of Deckers Brands is one of opportunistic acquisitions and impeccable timing. Founded in 1973 in Goleta, California, by Doug Otto, the company began as a simple maker of flip-flops popular in surf culture.\n\nThe company's plans to divest the Sanuk brand align with its long-term objectives, allowing for a more focused allocation of resources towards brands with higher growth potential. This strategic move, combined with the expansion of the UGG and HOKA brands, presents an opportunity to capture additional market share.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nAfter a record-breaking fiscal year 2025, Deckers is currently navigating a period of valuation recalibration. Following a massive 6-for-1 stock split in late 2024, the company saw its shares reach historic highs, only to face a significant correction in early 2026.\n\nPiper Sandler lowered Deckers Outdoor from a \"neutral\" rating to an \"underweight\" rating and lowered their price objective for the company from $100.00 to $85.00 in a report on Wednesday, January 7th.\n\nNew ESG disclosure laws in the EU have increased the cost of compliance for Deckers' international operations, as the company must now provide detailed carbon-footprint reporting for every SKU sold in the European market.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: **7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strong Brand Portfolio**: Both HOKA and UGG demonstrate exceptional brand power with sustained growth momentum\n- **Financial Excellence**: Strong balance sheet with $1.4B cash, no debt, and consistent double-digit growth\n- **Market Share Gains**: Successfully capturing market share from established competitors like Nike and Adidas\n- **International Expansion**: 38% international revenue growth provides geographic diversification\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Impressive margins and cash generation capabilities\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Tariff exposure and supply chain concentration in Vietnam\n- Valuation correction from 2025 highs indicating potential overvaluation concerns\n- Increasing competitive pressure in performance footwear market\n- Dependence on two primary brands for majority of revenue\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: **$125-135**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, considering:\n- DCF model pointing to a value of $136.34 per share versus the current $97.98 price\n- Strong fundamental performance with 19% average revenue growth over five years\n- Premium brand positioning with pricing power demonstrated through successful price increases\n- International growth trajectory targeting 50% of total revenue\n- Current valuation discount relative to historical multiples and growth prospects\n\nThe stock appears undervalued at current levels around $108, offering attractive upside potential for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite, despite near-term headwinds from tariffs and market volatility.",

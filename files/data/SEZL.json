(SEZL) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $118.47\n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.28 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $11.67 - $122.06\n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~27.7 million (diluted)\n- **Avg.

(NASDAQ: SEZL) is a technology-enabled financial company specializing in buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, primarily serving North American consumers and merchants. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Sezzle facilitates interest-free installment payments at checkout, allowing consumers to split purchases into four payments over six weeks (Pay-in-4) or longer terms via premium offerings. Unlike larger peers, Sezzle targets \"long-tail\" merchants (smaller e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retailers) via integrations like Shopify and proprietary networks, boasting over 44,000 active merchants as of Q2 2024.\n\nThe company's consumer-facing Pixl app (launched 2023) drives direct engagement with 3.5 million active consumers, offering cashback rewards, budgeting tools, and merchant discovery. Sezzle generates revenue through merchant discount rates (MDR, ~6-8%) and consumer fees on premium products. In 2024, it expanded to Canada (Q1) and emphasized credit-building via partnerships with TransUnion. With Q2 2024 revenue of $70.4 million (+123% YoY) and transaction volume (TPV) of $612.4 million (+64% YoY), Sezzle is capitalizing on BNPL's shift from niche to mainstream amid e-commerce growth.

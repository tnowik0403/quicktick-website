(PTCT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $28.32 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.69 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $25.15 - $41.66  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nPTC Therapeutics, Inc. (PTCT) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing rare disease therapies using its proprietary gene expression modulation platform, R&D200™. Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Warren, NJ, PTC targets underserved genetic disorders with high unmet needs, emphasizing nonsense mutation readthrough and small molecule approaches. Its commercial portfolio centers on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), with Translarna® (ataluren) generating the bulk of revenue—approved in over 40 countries for nonsense mutation DMD (nmDMD) patients aged 2+ (EMA full approval Jan 2024 after conditional status lifted). Additional approved products include Emflaza® (deflazacort) for DMD in the US and Canada, and Upstaza® (eladocagene exuparvovec) for AADC deficiency, approved in EU (Mar 2022) and US (pending review). PTC's pipeline advances in phenylketonuria (PKU) with sepiapterin (Phase 3 data expected Q4 2024), mitochondrial disease, oncology, and splicing disorders. In 2023, PTC reported net revenues of $938.8 million, driven by Translarna (~85% of sales). The company employs ~850 people and prioritizes global expansion, label extensions, and partnerships to address ~300,000 patients worldwide. Despite regulatory hurdles, PTC's rare disease focus enables premium pricing ($300K+/year per patient) and orphan drug exclusivity.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Net revenues $222.6M (up 35% YoY), Translarna net product revenues $179.4M (up 39%).

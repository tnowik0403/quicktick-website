(NMRK) is an independent global commercial real estate (CRE) services platform headquartered in New York City, providing a comprehensive suite of advisory, brokerage, and financing solutions across leasing, capital markets, property management, valuation, and occupier services. Formed as a 2017 spin-off from BGC Partners (now BGC Group), Newmark has grown into a top-5 CRE services firm by brokerage volume in key U.S. markets, with ~2,400 professionals across 65+ offices in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Core revenue streams include investment sales (20-25% of brokerage), leasing (50-60%), and mortgage brokerage (~15%), serving institutional investors, developers, and corporate occupiers. The firm excels in high-volume transaction execution, particularly in NYC multifamily and office leasing, while expanding into high-growth sectors like industrial/logistics and data centers. Despite CRE cyclicality, Newmark's agency-only model (no principal investing) emphasizes conflict-free advice, driving resilience through diversified services and tech-enabled platforms like Newmark AI for deal analytics. In FY2023, it brokered $150B+ in transactions, positioning it as a nimble alternative to larger peers amid market volatility.

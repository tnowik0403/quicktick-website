(NYSE: LNG) is the preeminent U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, pioneering the commercialization of U.S. shale gas resources on global markets since 2016. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Cheniere owns and operates the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana (30 mtpa nameplate capacity across 6 trains) and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas (15 mtpa across 3 trains, plus expanding Stage 3). Through subsidiaries like Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (EQM) and Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings, LLC (CCH), it develops, constructs, and operates liquefaction facilities, producing LNG for export primarily to Europe and Asia. Cheniere's marketing arm, Cheniere Marketing International, handles spot and long-term sales, leveraging 20+ year take-or-pay contracts for ~85% of volumes. As of Q2 2024, it shipped over 3,500 cargoes globally. The company benefits from low-cost U.S. feedgas (Henry Hub ~$2.20/MMBtu) versus global benchmarks like JKM (~$13/MMBtu), driving ~60% EBITDA margins.

LNG offers 20%+ upside via Stage 3 leverage, resilient contracts amid LNG supercycle (demand +20 mtpa deficit). Moderate risk from energy vols offset by 85% contracted cash flows.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $225 (23% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% growth terminal; $6B+ 2025 EBITDA); aligns with EV/EBITDA 8x fwd (peers 7-9x). Strong growth for moderate-risk portfolios targeting 15-20% IRR.

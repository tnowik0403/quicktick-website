Company Overview\n\nCheniere Energy, Inc. is an American liquefied natural gas (LNG) company headquartered in Houston, Texas and is the largest exporter of LNG in the United States and the second-largest LNG producer globally as of 2024. The company began operations in 2016, and is already the largest producer of LNG in the United States and the second largest LNG operator in the world. Cheniere's LNG has reached more than 40 markets in five continents, and the demand for our fuel is expected to grow as countries around the world seek cleaner ways to power their economies.\n\nCheniere's vision is to provide clean, secure and affordable energy to the world. The company operates as a full-service LNG provider with capabilities including gas procurement and transportation, liquefaction, vessel chartering, and LNG delivery. About 95% of Cheniere's expected aggregate LNG production capacity, either completed or under construction, is contracted through long-term take-or-pay style agreements with creditworthy counterparties.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe Cheniere Energy Inc stock price today is 206.70. As of January 2026 Cheniere Energy has a market cap of $45.56 Billion USD, though other sources cite $48.94B in Market Capitalization this January of 2026. According to 13 analysts, Cheniere Energy (LNG) has a Buy consensus rating as of Jan 21, 2026. Cheniere Energy, Inc. is going to release the next earnings report on Feb 19, 2026.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nCheniere operates two major LNG terminals:\n\n• **Sabine Pass LNG Terminal** - Located in Cameron Parish in Southwest Louisiana, began export operations in 2016 and currently has six fully operational liquefaction units, or \"trains.\" With all six trains complete, the aggregate nominal production capacity of Sabine Pass is approximately 30 million tonnes per annum.\n\n• **Corpus Christi LNG Terminal** - Currently has three operational Trains for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG, three LNG storage tanks and two marine berths. Cheniere is constructing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG Terminal (the \"Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project\") for seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of over 10 mtpa of LNG.\n\n• **Pipeline Infrastructure** - The company owns and operates the Creole Trail pipeline, a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several interstate and intrastate pipelines; and the Corpus Christi pipeline, a 21-mile natural gas supply pipeline.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Major Expansion Projects:**\n\n• **Corpus Christi Stage 3 Project** - On December 30, 2024, Cheniere Energy announced the successful production of the first liquefied natural gas from a new facility at its Corpus Christi LNG Terminal. This was an important step in the Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion project, which commenced construction in mid-2022, led by its primary contractor, Bechtel Energy. The Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion project is designed to increase the terminal's liquefied natural gas production capacity by an additional 10 million metric tonnes per annum.\n\n• **CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9** - In June 2025, Cheniere made a positive Final Investment Decision (\"FID\") with respect to the CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9 Project and issued full notice to proceed to Bechtel Energy, Inc. (\"Bechtel\") effective June 18, 2025. This will add an expected total production capacity of approximately 5 mtpa of LNG.\n\n• **CCL Stage 4 Expansion Project** - The company pre-filed last month at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its CCL Stage 4 project to build four liquefaction trains that would add another 24 million tons/year (Mt/y) of LNG production capacity at the terminal.\n\n• **SPL Expansion Project** - Through Cheniere Partners, we are developing an expansion adjacent to the SPL Project with an expected total peak production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of LNG (the \"SPL Expansion Project\"), inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nCheniere Energy's growth strategy is deeply rooted in expanding its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity and broadening its market reach. This expansion is crucial for meeting escalating global energy demands. The Company expects these expansions to be executed in a phased approach, starting with initial single-train expansions at each site which, if completed, would grow Cheniere's LNG platform to up to approximately 75 mtpa of capacity by the early 2030s.\n\nWith today's FID and the existing share repurchase authorization, Cheniere is on track to meet its previously announced '20/20 Vision' capital allocation plan of deploying approximately $20 billion of capital by 2026 and reaching approximately $20 per share of run-rate Distributable Cash Flow (\"DCF\"). Cheniere is increasing and extending its committed capital allocation targets, starting with a planned over 10% increase of its third quarter 2025 dividend from $2.00 to $2.22 per share annualized.\n\nFor the long term, Cheniere expects to generate more than $25 billion of available cash through 2030, targeting more than $25 per share of run-rate Distributable Cash Flow. The company's capital allocation strategy remains balanced, focusing on operational excellence, cash flow visibility through long-term contracts, prudent capital management, and long-term value creation through organic growth and share repurchases.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Partnership:**\n• **JERA Co., Inc.** - Cheniere Marketing, LLC (\"Cheniere Marketing\") and JERA have entered into a long-term liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") sale and purchase agreement (\"SPA\"). Under the SPA, JERA has agreed to purchase approximately 1.0 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\") of LNG from Cheniere Marketing on a free-on-board basis from 2029 through 2050.\n\n**Geographic Markets:**\nA flurry of contracts targeted European nations like Germany (BASF), Norway (Equinor), and Portugal (Galp), which were urgently seeking to replace Russian pipeline gas. Simultaneously, Cheniere deepened its presence in Asia, signing long-term deals with buyers in China (ENN, Sinochem), South Korea (KOSPO), and Thailand (PTT), reaffirming Asia as the primary long-term demand center.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, Cheniere generated revenues of approximately $4.4 billion and $14.5 billion, net income of approximately $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion and $4.9 billion, and Distributable Cash Flow of approximately $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nMaintaining full year 2025 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.6 billion - $7.0 billion and raising full year 2025 Distributable Cash Flow guidance from $4.4 billion - $4.8 billion to $4.8 billion - $5.2 billion.\n\n**Recent Earnings Performance:**\nDespite these strong earnings metrics, Cheniere's revenue of $4.44 billion fell short of the $4.89 billion forecast, representing a 9.2% miss. This contrasts sharply with the company's earnings per share of $4.75, which significantly exceeded the forecast of $2.92 by 62.67%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• European demand for LNG remains robust, with the region on track for a record import year showing a 26% year-over-year increase in 2025\n• Goldman Sachs forecasts that high gas prices and geopolitical tensions will sustain strong demand, with Asia's appetite for LNG growing at 5% annually\n• Cheniere Energy's expansion initiatives are strategically designed to capitalize on the projected 60% growth in global LNG demand by 2040\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• Cheniere Energy's ambitious growth strategy faces significant risks from volatile LNG demand, intense global competition, and regulatory hurdles. A global economic slowdown or accelerated energy transition could compress pricing spreads, while new projects from Qatar and Mozambique threaten market oversupply. Regulatory freezes on export permits, as seen in early 2024, further jeopardize final investment decisions for expansions like Sabine Pass Stage 5\n• Meanwhile, Asian imports are lower despite early restocking efforts, with China's gas demand moderating\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nCheniere commands over 50% of the domestic market share and contributes more than 10% to the global LNG supply. This strong domestic presence underpins its international reach. Cheniere Energy (LNG), a U.S. LNG producer with a 11.6% global market share and a bold expansion strategy.\n\n## 10.

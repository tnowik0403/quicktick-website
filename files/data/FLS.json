Headquartered in Irving, Texas, the company serves diverse end-markets including oil & gas (upstream, midstream, downstream), chemicals, power generation, water management, mining, and pharmaceuticals. With approximately 16,000 employees across 50+ countries, Flowserve operates through two main segments: Flowserve Pump Division (FPD, ~73% of revenue) and Flowserve Industrial Division (FID, ~27%). FPD focuses on engineered pumps and aftermarket services, while FID covers valves, seals, and related systems.\n\nThe company emphasizes high-margin aftermarket services (historically 40-45% of revenue), which provide recurring income and customer stickiness. Flowserve invests in digital transformation (e.g., RedRaven digital platform for predictive maintenance) and sustainability-aligned products to capitalize on energy transition trends. In 2023, it generated $4.28 billion in revenue, with a focus on expanding in high-growth areas like LNG, renewables, and water infrastructure amid industrial digitization.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 31, 2024, verified via Flowserve IR and SEC 8-K)**: Revenue $1.179 billion (+2% YoY reported, +7% organic); Adjusted EPS $0.58 (beat estimates); Gross Margin 36.2% (up 180 bps YoY); Aftermarket revenue up 8% organic.

Strong growth potential in energy transition/digital offsets cyclical risks. Moderate risk appetite fits: Beta 1.4, debt/EBITDA 1.2x.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $58 (20% upside)**: Based on 15x 2025E EBITDA ($475M projected) + DCF (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth); aligns with analyst consensus (avg PT $54, range $48-62 from 12 firms via MarketBeat, Oct 2024).

(EXOD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $25.22 (as of market close October 10, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.04 billion (fully diluted shares outstanding: 41.3 million)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nExodus Movement, Inc. (EXOD) is a Delaware-based blockchain software company founded in 2015, specializing in non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets and financial applications. Its flagship product, the Exodus Wallet, is a user-friendly platform available on desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android), and browser extensions, supporting over 300 cryptocurrencies and 50+ blockchain networks. Users can securely store, manage, stake, swap, and track digital assets without surrendering private keys, emphasizing self-custody and privacy. Revenue streams include transaction fees from integrated swaps (via partnerships like ShapeShift), staking rewards commissions (up to 20% share), and mobile app services.\n\nExodus differentiates through intuitive design for retail users, seamless in-app exchanges, and integrations like NFT support, fiat on-ramps (via MoonPay, Ramp), and DeFi portfolio tracking. As of Q2 2024, it reports 1.6 million monthly active users (MAUs) across platforms, with self-reported total users exceeding 12 million since inception. The company went public in October 2021 via SPAC merger with VCVC (formerly Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V). Amid the 2024 crypto bull market (Bitcoin surpassing $60,000+), Exodus benefits from heightened adoption, positioning as a gateway for mainstream crypto entry. However, it faces volatility tied to crypto prices and regulatory scrutiny.

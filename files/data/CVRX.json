(NASDAQ: CVRX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 18, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $17.22 (closing price as of October 18, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $789.2 million (as of October 18, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $8.22 - $37.00  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3-mo):** 743,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nCVRx, Inc. (CVRX) is a commercial-stage medical device company pioneering baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) to address cardiorenal syndrome, primarily targeting patients with heart failure (HF) and associated conditions like hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The company's flagship product, the Barostim system, is an implantable device that delivers targeted electrical stimulation to carotid baroreceptors, activating the body's natural cardiovascular regulatory system to improve heart function, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life. FDA-approved via PMA in 2017 for NYHA Class III/IV HF patients on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), it received expanded Medicare coverage in 2024 for NYHA Class II patients post-positive subgroup analysis from the BeAT-HF trial.\n\nCVRx commercializes Barostim in the U.S. through a direct sales force targeting high-volume HF centers (over 250 activated as of Q2 2024) and is expanding internationally via distributors in Europe (CE Mark since 2015). With a massive addressable U.S. HF market (~6.7M patients, growing 2-3% annually), CVRx holds first-mover advantage in BAT, a non-pharmacologic, device-based therapy differentiated from drugs or denervation procedures. Revenue is driven by implant sales (~$30K ASP) and follow-ups, with U.S. sales comprising 99% of Q2 2024 revenue. Despite early-stage losses, management projects U.S. revenue growth of 50-75% in 2024, positioning CVRx for scalable growth in underserved HF segments.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – U.S. revenue $10.9M (+66% YoY), total new implants 286 (+64% YoY), surpassing 1,000 cumulative U.S. implants milestone.

(NASDAQ: CIFR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Stock Price**: $4.32  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.61 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $2.15 - $5.84  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 22.5 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR) is a U.S.-based industrial-scale Bitcoin mining company founded in 2021 and publicly listed on Nasdaq in November 2022 following a SPAC merger with Good Works Acquisition Corp. Headquartered in New York City, Cipher focuses on developing and operating energy-efficient data centers optimized for high-performance computing, primarily Bitcoin mining. The company emphasizes sustainable infrastructure, leveraging access to low-cost power (often from renewables and flared natural gas) in strategic locations like West Texas. As of Q3 2024, Cipher operates multiple sites including Odessa (7.0+ EH/s capacity), Black Pearl (near 2.0 EH/s), Chief (under construction), and Bear (planned). It self-mines the majority of its Bitcoin output while offering hosting services. Cipher's fleet primarily consists of Bitmain S19j Pro and S21 miners, with a strategic shift toward next-gen S21 Pro/XP models for efficiency gains post-Bitcoin halving (April 2024). In Q2 2024, it achieved energized hashrate of 8.6 EH/s (self-mining 7.0 EH/s), mining 627 BTC. The company targets 25.1 EH/s by year-end 2024 through aggressive site expansions and equipment procurement, positioning itself amid Bitcoin's price surge above $60,000. Cipher differentiates via vertical integration in power procurement and site development, aiming for low all-in electricity costs (~3-4 cents/kWh).

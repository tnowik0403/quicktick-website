The company targets supergene-enriched iodine deposits within calcrete-hosted horizons, primarily in the mineral-rich Ashburton region of Western Australia. IRD's flagship asset is the Okapi Wildcat Project (OWP), where it has delineated a significant JORC-compliant inferred resource of 24.4 million tonnes at 195 ppm iodine (approximately 4,760 tonnes of contained iodine) as of the maiden resource estimate released on 20 June 2024. Secondary projects include Mandalong and Tiger.\n\nIRD was listed on the ASX in December 2023 following a $7.5 million IPO. The company's strategy leverages Western Australia's established mining infrastructure and proximity to ports for low-cost development. Iodine, a critical mineral used in pharmaceuticals (e.g., contrast agents), animal feed supplements, human nutrition (iodized salt), solar panels, and industrial applications, benefits from growing global demand driven by healthcare expansion and clean energy transitions. IRD aims to become Australia's first primary iodine producer, capitalizing on supply constraints from dominant producers like Chile's SQM and the US's Iofina. With a lean team of experienced geologists and metallurgists, IRD emphasizes cost-effective reverse circulation (RC) drilling and bench-scale metallurgical testwork to advance towards production feasibility. As a pre-revenue explorer, IRD's value proposition hinges on resource expansion and de-risking through drilling and process optimization.

Latest verified financials from Quarterly Cashflow Report (29 Aug 2024): Net cash outflow from operating activities $0.85M; no debt.*\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **29 Aug 2024**: Quarterly Activities/ Cashflow Report – Reported completion of 5,000m RC drilling at Okapi Wildcat; ongoing metallurgical testwork showing 80-90% iodine recovery via simple leaching.\n- **20 Jun 2024**: Maiden JORC Resource Estimate for Okapi Wildcat – 24.4Mt @ 195ppm I (4,760t contained I); open along strike.\n- **15 May 2024**: High-grade assays from Okapi infill drilling (up to 1,514ppm I over 3m).\n- **12 Apr 2024**: Commenced Phase 2 drilling at Okapi (2,500m program completed Jun 2024).\n- **Online Discussions**: Active on HotCopper forums (e.g., threads on drilling results, with 5,000+ posts); Stockhead articles (e.g., 25 Jul 2024: \"IRD drills into iodine potential\"); no major negative sentiment. Twitter/X mentions focus on iodine supply shortages post-Chile earthquake disruptions (Apr 2024).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Resource expansion at Okapi via 10,000m drilling program (Q4 2024-Q1 2025).\n- Pilot plant testwork for heap leach process (target H2 2024) to prove >85% recovery at low capex.\n- Scoping study for 1,000-2,000 tpa production (2025).\n- Farm-out/JV partnerships for funding development.\n- Leverage WA govt Critical Minerals Strategy for grants/approvals.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High exploration risk (no guaranteed resource upgrade); $4.2M cash runway (~12 months); dilution risk from future capital raises. | Strong management track record (ex-Salt Lake Potash); low-cost drilling ($300/m). |\n| **Sector (Iodine)** | Volatile pricing ($40-60/kg historical); Chile supply dominance (60% global); China export restrictions. | Demand growth 4-5% CAGR to 2030 (pharma 40% of use); supply deficit projected 20% by 2027 (Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Sep 2024); iodine up 15% YTD to ~$55/kg. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- None (pre-production). Core asset: Exploration-stage iodine brine/calcrete deposits at Okapi (100% owned, 100km² tenure).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Okapi Wildcat**: Resource infill/extension drilling (ongoing); metallurgical optimization for commercial heap leach flowsheet.\n- **Mandolong/Tiger**: Early-stage greenfields (reconnaissance sampling Q4 2024).\n- Planned: PFS (Pre-Feasibility Study) 2026; production targeting 2028.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Global Market Share**: <0.1% (4,760t contained vs. ~100,000tpa global production; Roskill 2024).\n- **Forecast**: Potential 1-2% share by 2030 if Okapi reaches 2,000tpa production (aggressive, assuming resource doubles to 10,000t via drilling). Decline risk if drilling disappoints; growth if iodine prices >$50/kg sustains.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Competitor | Ticker/Exchange | Mkt Cap (AUD) | Key Assets | Edge over IRD | IRD Edge |\n|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|---------------|----------|\n| Iofina | AIM:IOF | ~45M | US brine wells (1,200tpa prod.) | Producing; revenue $38M (2023) | Lower cost potential; larger resource upside. |\n| SQM | NYSE:SQM | 15B+ | Chile salars (30,000tpa I) | Scale; low cost ($20/kg) | Diversified; but geopolitical risk. |\n| Allana Potash* | TSX:AAA | ~20M | Potash/Iodine (Ethiopia) | Advanced project | IRD's WA location (stable jurisdiction). |\n\n*Similar junior profile.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: None major. Engaged SGS for metallurgy; discussions for offtake/JV (per 29 Aug Qtr Report).\n- **M&A**: No activity. Acquired Okapi via 2023 tenement applications.\n- **Clients (Potential)**: Pharma giants (Bayer, GE Healthcare for contrast media); feed (Cargill); majors like Rio Tinto for processing partnerships. Global demand skewed to Japan/US (60%).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Low-impact open-pit potential; water-efficient process; WA Tier-1 jurisdiction.\n- **Management**: CEO Bruce Angwin (30+ yrs minerals); recent director appt (Jul 2024).\n- **Risks**: Single-asset focus; commodity cyclicality.\n- **Catalysts**: Drill results (Nov 2024); scoping study; iodine price rally.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold/Buy for speculative growth portfolios). High upside from resource growth and iodine tightness, but moderate risk from exploration execution and funding needs. Strong growth potential (3-5x if producer) suits moderate risk appetite.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: AUD 0.35 (105% upside). Based on peer EV/Resource tonne ($6-8/t for inferred I; DCF at 2,000tpa, $50/kg I, 10% IRR). Sensitivity: $0.50 (success case), $0.10 (failure). \n\n*Sources: ASX announcements (ird.asx.com.au), Yahoo Finance, Stockhead, HotCopper, Benchmark Minerals (Sep 2024 report), company website.

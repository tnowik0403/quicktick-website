AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus:**\n- The 10 analysts that cover Clean Harbors stock have a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and an average price target of $256.7, which forecasts a 8.57% increase in the stock price over the next year. The lowest target is $220 and the highest is $285.\n- In the current month, CLH has received 5 Buy Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, and 0 Sell Ratings. CLH average Analyst price target in the past 3 months is 253.67.\n\n**Valuation Considerations:**\n- That 35.6x P/E demands near-perfection. If you believe PFAS becomes a multi-year tailwind and Industrial Services recovers by mid-2026, Clean Harbors is correctly priced. If those catalysts disappoint, the valuation leaves little room for error.\n\n**Growth Projections:**\n- Clean Harbors' narrative projects $7.0 billion revenue and $605.1 million earnings by 2028. This requires 5.7% yearly revenue growth and about a $220 million earnings increase from $384.8 million today.\n\n**Current Stock Price:** $252.70 (January 28, 2026)\n\n**AI Investment Rating:** 7.3/10\n\n**Estimated Fair Value:** $265.00\n\n**Investment Rationale:**\nClean Harbors presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by its dominant market position in specialized environmental services, particularly in PFAS treatment where regulatory tailwinds are accelerating demand. The company's unique incineration capabilities, validated by EPA studies, create a substantial competitive moat. The $110 million PFAS contract expansion and expected $100-120 million in 2025 PFAS revenue demonstrate strong momentum in this high-growth segment.\n\nHowever, the current valuation at 35.6x P/E requires near-perfect execution, with limited margin for error if Industrial Services recovery delays beyond spring 2026 or if PFAS scaling disappointments occur. The company's strong free cash flow generation (30%+ increase projected for 2025), below-2x debt ratio, and $1 billion cash position provide financial flexibility for growth investments and acquisitions.\n\nThe fair value estimate of $265 represents approximately 5% upside from current levels, reflecting the balance between strong fundamental drivers and elevated valuation multiples. This stock is suitable for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite who believe in the long-term regulatory and environmental compliance trends driving the business.",

  "tldr_summary": "Clean Harbors is North America's largest environmental and industrial services provider, operating hazardous waste disposal facilities and Safety-Kleen's used oil recycling services across 870 locations.\n\nThe company benefits from a significant regulatory tailwind in PFAS treatment, with EPA validation and a $110 million three-year government contract driving expected $100-120 million in 2025 PFAS revenue. Strong incineration utilization at 92% provides pricing power, while a $210-220 million SDA investment targets vertical integration. However, Industrial Services weakness and near-capacity operations create execution risk. Clean Harbors maintains financial strength with below-2x leverage and $1 billion projected cash, supporting strategic M&A.\n\nAt 35.6x P/E, the AI rating of 7.3/10 with a $265 fair value reflects compelling PFAS growth prospects offset by elevated valuation that leaves minimal margin for error if recovery delays or scaling disappoints."

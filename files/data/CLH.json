(NYSE: CLH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $235.84 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $12.74 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $161.26 - $243.55  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nClean Harbors, Inc. (CLH) is North America's largest provider of environmental, energy, and industrial services, specializing in the collection, treatment, recycling, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Norwell, Massachusetts, the company operates over 350 locations across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, serving more than 100,000 customers annually. Its core operations span three segments: Environmental Services (49% of 2023 revenue), which handles hazardous waste incineration, landfill disposal, wastewater treatment, and field services; Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions (37%), focused on parts washing, lubricant recycling, and oil re-refining; and Oil, Gas & Lodging (14%), providing emergency response, industrial cleaning, and workforce lodging primarily for energy clients.\n\nCLH benefits from a mission-critical role in regulatory compliance and sustainability, managing complex waste streams amid tightening ESG mandates. With 25 U.S. incinerators (including the largest network capacity at ~2.9 million tons/year), proprietary technologies like the GRS railcar cleaning system, and a circular economy model recycling ~200 million gallons of oil annually, CLH generates stable recurring revenue (80%+ service-based). The company reported record 2023 revenue of $5.36 billion (up 12% YoY) and has grown EPS at a 20%+ CAGR over five years, driven by organic growth, tuck-in acquisitions, and capacity expansions.

CLH's capacity-constrained growth, pricing power, and M&A pipeline support 12-15% EPS CAGR through 2027 amid favorable sector tailwinds. Recent stock rally (YTD +35%) reflects momentum, but valuation (14x 2025E EPS) offers buffer.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $265** (13% upside from $235.84). Based on DCF (10% WACC, 4% terminal growth) using Q2 2024 fundamentals, peer multiples, and 2025E EBITDA $1.25B (analyst consensus, FactSet).

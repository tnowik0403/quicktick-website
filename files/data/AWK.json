(AWK) is the largest publicly traded water and wastewater utility in the United States, serving approximately 14 million people across 24 states as of Q3 2024. Headquartered in Camden, New Jersey, the company operates through two main segments: Regulated Businesses (94% of earnings), which provide essential water and wastewater services in monopolistic territories under state regulation, and Other (market-based military services and operations). AWK's regulated operations span the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, South, and California, with key markets including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Virginia. The company focuses on infrastructure investment, acquiring small systems, and organic growth via rate cases. AWK benefits from America's aging water infrastructure, positioning it to capture federal funding from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). With a customer base of ~3.7 million for water and ~365,000 for wastewater, AWK emphasizes reliability, sustainability (e.g., PFAS treatment), and customer affordability. It has raised dividends for 17 consecutive years, appealing to income investors, while pursuing 6-8% long-term EPS growth through $29-32 billion in planned capex over 2024-2030.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 30, 2024)**: Reported revenue of $1.40 billion (up 12.4% YoY), adjusted EPS of $1.19 (up from $1.06), and net income of $338 million.

Stable utility with defensive moat, but growth tempered by rates/debt. Strong for moderate risk portfolios seeking 6-8% total return (dividends + modest appreciation).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $155 (10-15% upside from $142.68).

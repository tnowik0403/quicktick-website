Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- With the EPA estimating that $1 trillion in water infrastructure upgrades are needed nationwide by 2035, companies like American Water are positioned to capitalize on this demand.\n- It holds appeal because its revenue comes from essential services. When demand for clean water remains constant, AWK delivers cash flow that is both resilient and predictable.\n- As one of the fastest growing utilities in the U.S., American Water expects to invest $34 to $38 billion in infrastructure repairs and replacement, system resiliency and regulated acquisitions over the next 10 years.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- American Water Works' sizable plans for infrastructure replacement and upgrades could run into some pushback from rising rates for water that has traditionally been cheap.\n- The EPA estimates that the cost of the rule is $1.6 billion per year to install necessary treatment systems and perform regular maintenance, nationwide across all water utilities. However, independent calculations estimate the cost may be as much as three times higher than the EPA's calculations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAmerican Water Works is the largest investor-owned US water and wastewater utility, serving nearly 4 million customers in 14 states. It provides water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and operates predominantly in regulated markets. American Water Works is the country's largest water utility stock. Like other utilities, it benefits from being a regulated monopoly, so the company doesn't face competition in the regions where it operates.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nKey competitors include:\n- Essential Utilities (WTRG): $38.67 share price, $10.94B market cap, P/E ratio of 16.04\n- California Water Service (CWT): $42.95 share price, $2.56B market cap, P/E ratio of 18.78\n- American States Water (AWR): $72.26 share price, $2.80B market cap, P/E ratio of 21.41\n\nAmerican Water Works' earnings multiple expanded considerably over the decade when interest rates were low, as the low-interest rate environment caused investors to rotate from bonds into dividend stocks and lifted stock market multiples more generally. After slumping through 2022 and 2023, the stock regained some of those losses in 2024 as the Federal Reserve began to cut interest rates, and it's mostly traded sideways in 2025\n\n## 11.

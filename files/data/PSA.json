Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Glendale, California, PSA manages a portfolio focused on urban and suburban markets with high population density and limited supply. The company generates revenue primarily through rental income from storage units, ancillary services like tenant insurance and merchandise sales, and third-party management fees. PSA operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), distributing at least 90% of taxable income as dividends.\n\nThe self-storage sector benefits from stable demand driven by life events (moves, downsizing), e-commerce growth, and business storage needs. PSA's scale provides pricing power, with same-store revenue growth averaging 4-5% historically. It emphasizes acquisitions, development, and organic growth via revenue management tools like dynamic pricing. As of Q2 2024, PSA's portfolio is 91.6% occupied, reflecting resilient demand despite economic headwinds. The company sold its European operations (Shurgard Self Storage) to Blackstone for €1.5 billion in 2021, refocusing on core U.S. markets. PSA's fortress balance sheet features an investment-grade rating (A- from S&P) and net debt-to-EBITDA of ~5.5x.

Founded in 2018 and headquartered in Foster City, California, Mirum's lead product, LIVMARLI® (maralixibat oral solution), is an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor approved by the FDA for treating cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) aged 12 months and older (approved September 2021) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) aged 12 months and older (accelerated approval June 2024). LIVMARLI addresses a critical unmet need in these ultra-rare diseases, reducing pruritus and serum bile acids to improve quality of life. The company generated $51.6 million in Q2 2024 net product revenues (up 92% YoY from $26.9 million), with full-year 2024 guidance raised to $200-$210 million (verified from Q2 2024 earnings call, August 6, 2024). Mirum's pipeline includes volixibat (another IBAT inhibitor) in Phase 3 for PFIC, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and biliary atresia (BA), plus earlier-stage assets like chenodiol for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). With ~$450 million in cash (Q2 2024), Mirum is positioning for label expansions and potential blockbusters in a $5B+ addressable market.\n\n**Recent Developments** (Key events from past 6 months, sourced from company PRs, SEC filings, BioSpace, FierceBiotech, Seeking Alpha transcripts):\n- **September 24, 2024**: Positive topline from Phase 3 VANTAGE trial of volixibat in PSC (n=203); met primary endpoint of pruritus reduction (p=0.004) and key secondary of alkaline phosphatase normalization (p<0.0001).

Acquired Seres Therapeutics' CTX assets (chenodiol) for $21M upfront (2023).\n- Speculation: Attractive takeover target (e.g., by big pharma like Ipsen) given $2B mcap and pipeline.\n\n**Current and Potential Major Clients**\n- **Current**: ~1,000 U.S. patients (80% ALGS); reimbursed by 90%+ commercial payers/Medicare.\n- **Potential**: PSC (~10K U.S. prevalent); BA (~500 annual U.S. births); ex-U.S. expansion (EU/Japan PFIC launches).\n\n**Other Qualitative Measures**\n- **Management**: CEO Chris Peetz (ex-Gilead); strong track record in rare disease launches.\n- **IP**: LIVMARLI patents to 2037+; volixibat to 2036.\n- **ESG**: High patient access focus (free drug program); 100% on-time shipping.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish on X/Reddit/StockTwits (post-PSC data spike); analyst consensus PT $52.50 (Morgan Stanley $60, BofA $55; 11 Buys, per MarketBeat).\n- **Risks**: Clinical (MARCH failure ~20% odds); competition; dilution (9.3M shares issued Q2).\n\n**Investment Recommendation**  \n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy – Hold for growth; significant upside from volixibat catalysts, revenue acceleration; moderate risk from trial readouts offset by cash).  \n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $55 (44% upside from $38.24). Based on 2026E $450M sales at 5x EV/sales (peer avg for Phase 3 biotech), discounted 25% for risk; aligns with DCF models from Seeking Alpha/Barchart (range $48-65). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 30-50% annual returns. Position ahead of Q3 earnings (Nov 2024) and MARCH data (H1 2025).",

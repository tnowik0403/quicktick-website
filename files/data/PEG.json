(PSE&G), the state's largest investor-owned utility. PSE&G delivers electricity and natural gas to approximately 2.4 million electric and 1.9 million natural gas customers across a 2,600-square-mile service territory covering 24 counties in New Jersey, representing about 85-90% market share in its regulated monopoly areas. The company operates in two main segments: Public Service Electric & Gas (regulated utility, ~90% of earnings) and PSEG Power (non-regulated power generation and energy services). PSEG Power focuses on competitive wholesale electricity markets, primarily through its 50% ownership stakes in the Salem (nuclear, 1,174 MW) and Hope Creek (nuclear, 1,173 MW) plants in South Jersey, alongside smaller gas-fired and solar assets totaling ~3,400 MW capacity. PEG emphasizes clean energy transition, grid resilience, and infrastructure modernization amid rising electrification demands from EVs, data centers, and industrial growth. With a focus on regulated returns (9.6% ROE cap under NJ Board of Public Utilities), PEG has delivered consistent dividends for 118 years (Dividend Aristocrat) and invests heavily in capital projects, targeting $3.8-4.2 billion annually through 2028. The company benefits from New Jersey's aggressive clean energy goals (100% clean electricity by 2035) while navigating regulatory and interest rate pressures.

Overall revenue growth 4-6% CAGR (per Q3 guidance).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (TTM as of Q3 2024) | PEG | Exelon (EXC) | FirstEnergy (FE) | Dominion (D) |\n|----------------------------|-----|--------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Market Cap | $44B | $49B | $25B | $47B |\n| Regulated Revenue % | 90% | 95% | 100% | 75% |\n| Dividend Yield | 2.9% | 3.8% | 4.1% | 4.9% |\n| 5-Yr EPS CAGR | 6.2% | 5.1% | 4.8% | 3.9% |\n| Debt/EBITDA | 3.5x | 3.8x | 4.2x | 4.0x |\n- **Edge**: PEG's nuclear assets provide cleaner, baseload edge vs. coal-heavy peers; superior NJ growth vs. slower Midwest peers.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: 50/50 JV with Exelon on Salem/Hope Creek; transmission with OE Connection for offshore wind.\n- **M&A**: No major deals in 2024; sold last fossil plants (2019); potential nuclear expansion tuck-ins.\n- **Major Clients**: Residential (60% electric revenue), commercial/industrial (35%); PSE&G BGS supplies utilities like JCP&L.\n- **Potential Clients**: Data centers (e.g., Google/Amazon hyperscalers scouting NJ; 1 GW pipeline per Q3 call); EV fleets (NJ Transit partnership).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Ralph Izzo retiring 2025; successor DJ Mitchell (CFO) praised for execution.\n- **Credit**: A-/A3 ratings (S&P/Moody's); $2B ATM equity program.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (NJBPU rate cases); weather extremes.\n- **Opportunities**: PJM capacity auctions (PEG won 90% clears in 2024); federal IRA credits.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy for Hold/Buy)**  \n  Rationale: Attractive yield + 6% EPS growth amid utility rerating (sector P/E expanding to 20x); data center tailwinds undervalued; low beta suits moderate risk. Upside from nuclear credits and capex execution outweighs rate headwinds.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $98/share (12% upside).  \n  DCF-based (6% growth to 2028, 5% terminal, 7% WACC); aligns with consensus targets ($92 median per Yahoo/Oct 2024). Strong growth portfolio fit via regulated stability + electrification leverage.",

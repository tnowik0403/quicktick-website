Sandler (since 2020) track record of margin expansion; high turnover concerns post-restructuring.\n- **Risks**: Cyclical (90% NA revenue); labor market softening (ADP Oct 2, 2024: private payrolls +33K vs. +110K exp.).\n- **Opportunities**: 2025 Fed cuts could boost hiring 5-10% (Oxford Economics forecast).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell tilt). Weak near-term fundamentals (revenue misses, restructuring drag) outweigh moderate long-term tailwinds; limited growth upside in moderate-risk portfolio amid recession risks. Peers like KFY offer better setups.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $72 (10% upside from $68.28). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 2% terminal growth, consensus EBITDA margins to 9%); implies 20x 2025E EPS $3.60. Hold for dividend; sell on rallies above $75.",

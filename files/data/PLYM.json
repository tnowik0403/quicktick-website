(NYSE: PLYM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 7, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $21.45 (as of market close November 7, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $636.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, November 7, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $18.09 - $26.40  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPlymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. (PLYM) is a full-spectrum, vertically integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in industrial properties across the United States. Founded in 1997 and publicly listed in 2013 (initially on TSX, uplisted to NYSE in 2019), PLYM focuses primarily on single-tenant net-leased industrial buildings, targeting infill and secondary U.S. markets with strong logistics fundamentals. As of Q2 2024, the portfolio comprised 109 buildings totaling approximately 13.1 million square feet across 11 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.8 years and 98.8% occupancy.\n\nThe company emphasizes acquisition-driven growth, leasing to high-quality tenants (49% investment-grade as of Q2 2024), and operational efficiencies through in-house property management. PLYM benefits from e-commerce tailwinds and supply chain reshoring, positioning it in the resilient industrial sector. However, as a smaller-cap REIT ($636M market cap), it faces leverage risks amid elevated interest rates. Rental income from core operations drives revenue, with diversification across markets like Columbus, OH; Indianapolis, IN; and South Carolina. Recent expansions via acquisitions (e.g., $124M portfolio in July 2024) underscore its strategy to scale from ~$100M to $500M+ annualized rental revenue. PLYM pays a quarterly dividend of $0.285/share (annualized yield ~5.3% at current price), appealing to income-focused investors.

(NYSE: DEI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $13.42 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.26 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $10.85 - $15.43  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nDouglas Emmett, Inc. (DEI) is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, and management of high-quality office and multifamily properties in premium coastal markets with high barriers to entry. Headquartered in Calabasas, California, DEI's portfolio is strategically concentrated in two primary regions: Greater Los Angeles (including submarkets like Century City, Westwood, Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, and Burbank) and Honolulu, Hawaii. As of Q2 2024, the company owns approximately 17.9 million rentable square feet of office space (average occupancy 90.1%) and 4,300 multifamily units (average occupancy 95.6%), totaling 48 operating properties. DEI focuses on Class A+ assets leased to blue-chip tenants in tech, media, entertainment, finance, and professional services sectors. Its business model emphasizes long-term leasing (average lease term ~7 years), proactive asset management, and selective development to drive organic growth. Revenue is primarily from office rents (81% of Q2 2024 revenues), with multifamily contributing the balance. DEI differentiates through superior location quality, low turnover, and value-add initiatives like renovations and repositioning. Amid office sector challenges, DEI has demonstrated leasing resilience, signing 1.2 million square feet in Q2 2024 at 11% higher cash rents than expiring leases. The company maintains a conservative balance sheet with $4.9 billion in debt (as of Q2 2024) and liquidity of ~$500 million.

Market to $15B by 2030. | Intense competition from funded giants; browser changes (Chrome phasing cookies 2025); economic slowdown hits SMB budgets. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Consent Management Platform (CMP)**: Cookie scanner/banners; 95% of revenue.\n- **Data Privacy Operations (DPO)**: DSAR fulfillment, audits, risk assessments.\n- **Vendor Management**: Third-party scanning (1,000+ vendors supported).\n- Pricing: Freemium ($0), Pro ($99/mo), Enterprise (custom, avg. $5K ARR).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **AI Consent Orchestrator** (launched July 2024): Automates A/B testing for consent rates (+20% uplift claimed).\n- **DSAR Pro** (beta Q3 2024): Generative AI for request processing (reduces time 70%).\n- **Global Privacy Radar** (planned Q1 2025): Real-time reg change alerts via API.\n- Roadmap: Zero-party data tools (H2 2025) for post-cookie era.\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: <0.1% in $2B CMP market (est. via 3.6M ARR vs. OneTrust's $500M+; per company disclosures and Statista 2024).\n- **Forecast**: +20-30% YoY market share gain to 0.2-0.3% by 2026, driven by U.S. regs and integrations. Risks: Browser deprecation caps CMP at 30% of TAM long-term. Base case: ARR $6M by YE2025 (+67%).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Competitor       | Market Cap/Valuation | Revenue (Latest) | Key Edge vs. CLYM                  | CLYM Edge                     |\n|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **OneTrust** (Private) | $5B+ (2022)        | $550M (2023 est.) | Enterprise scale, 10K+ clients    | Lower cost (1/10th price)    |\n| **Osano** (Private)   | $1B (2022)         | $50M+ (2023)     | U.S. focus, funding ($45M)        | Multi-reg support, AI faster |\n| **Cookiebot (Usercentrics)** | $200M+ est.     | $30M (2023)      | WordPress dominance               | Broader DPO suite             |\n| **TrustArc** (Private) | N/A                | $20M est.        | Legacy compliance                 | Modern no-code UI             |\n\nCLYM lags in funding/scale but wins on affordability for SMBs (70% customers).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: BigCommerce (Apr 2024), Cloudflare Workers (2023), Google Tag Manager, Tealium, Ensighten. Co-marketing with 20+ agencies.\n- **M&A**: None completed; acquired small DSAR tool in 2022 (pre-OTC).\n- **Current Major Clients**: 5,000+ incl. mid-tier e-comm (e.g., unnamed via case studies: 30% consent rate boost); enterprises like financial services firms (anonymized in 6-K).\n- **Potential Clients**: U.S. retailers (Target-like via BigCommerce), media (post-CCPA), tech SMBs (Shopify ecosystem).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Gili Nachum (ex- cybersecurity); strong track record, 90% retention.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Israel-based, 20% staff there); forex (ILS/USD); reg uncertainty.\n- **ESG**: High privacy focus aligns with sustainability; carbon-neutral hosting.\n- **Sentiment**: Positive chatter on OTC forums (e.g., InvestorsHub: H1 growth hype); no analyst coverage; short interest negligible.\n\n## Recommendation\n**Buy Rating: 4/10 (Sell/Hold)**  \nRationale: Impressive 58% H1 revenue growth and ARR trajectory signal potential in booming privacy sector, but OTC penny status, micro-cap illiquidity, dilution risk (recent shelf filing), and competition cap upside for moderate-risk portfolios. Strong execution could 5x ARR in 2 years, but execution risks high.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $0.002** (10x 2025 ARR multiple on $6M est., 50% discount for OTC/risk; implies 10x upside but volatile). Hold for speculators; sell if needing liquidity. Not suitable for growth portfolios seeking stability.",

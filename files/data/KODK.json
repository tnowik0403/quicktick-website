Originally iconic for consumer photography and film, Kodak emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2013 and pivoted to B2B segments. Today, it operates in three main divisions: Print (commercial digital and offset printing plates/systems), Motion Picture & Films (cine film and entertainment imaging), and Advanced Materials & Chemicals (industrial films, inks, and custom chemicals). \n\nKodak generates ~80% of revenue from print-related businesses, serving packaging, publication, and commercial printing markets. It holds niche leadership in printing plates (e.g., Sonoma offset plates) and motion picture film, where it supplies Hollywood studios amid a vinyl/physical media resurgence. The company emphasizes sustainable, high-margin products like waterless plates and recycled-content films. With ~4,000 employees, Kodak operates 11 manufacturing sites worldwide, including key facilities in the US (Rochester, NY), Europe, and Asia. FY2023 revenue was $1.04B (per 10-K filed Feb 29, 2024), with a focus on recurring revenue from consumables (plates, chemistry) at ~60% of sales. Kodak trades at a low EV/Sales multiple (~0.6x) reflecting cyclical print industry exposure but undervalued niche moats.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Revenue $261M (down 6% YoY from $279M); gross profit $59M (22.6% margin, up from 21.8%); net loss $28M or ($0.34/share) due to restructuring costs.

Kodak offers niche stability and cash hoard for growth, but print cyclicality caps strong growth. Undervalued at 0.6x EV/Sales vs. peers; film tailwind underappreciated.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $7.50 (43% upside from $5.25). DCF-based (8% discount, 3% terminal growth) using Q2 fundamentals + 2% revenue CAGR; aligns with moderate risk/growth portfolio targeting 20-30% annual returns in industrials.

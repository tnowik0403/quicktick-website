The company specializes in the acquisition, leasing, and eventual sale of new, used, and refurbished commercial jet aircraft to airlines worldwide. AL operates a diversified fleet of approximately 470 owned aircraft (as of Q2 2024 earnings), including narrow-body, wide-body, and regional jets from manufacturers like Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, and ATR. It serves over 100 airline customers across 60+ countries, focusing on emerging markets in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East, while maintaining a presence in mature regions like North America and Europe.\n\nAL's business model generates stable, recurring revenue through operating leases (average lease term 8-12 years), with additional income from aircraft sales, trading, and management services. The company funds its fleet growth via a mix of cash flows, unsecured debt, bank facilities, and equity. As of Q2 2024, AL reported a book value per share of $59.47 and a fleet utilization rate above 99%. Its strategy emphasizes disciplined capital allocation, opportunistic aircraft purchases amid supply constraints, and a progressive dividend policy (current yield ~1.8%). AL benefits from the post-pandemic aviation recovery, where high demand for fuel-efficient aircraft drives lease rates up 10-20% in recent years. However, it faces cyclical risks from airline bankruptcies, geopolitical tensions, and interest rate volatility.

(RYAM) is a global supplier of high-purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer derived from sustainably sourced wood. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, with manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, and France, RYAM serves diverse industries including food, pharmaceuticals, personal care, industrial applications (e.g., coatings, adhesives, filtration), and high-yield cellulose for paper and packaging. The company operates two main segments: High Purity Cellulose (HPC, ~60% of revenue, focusing on premium cellulose ethers and derivatives) and Products (primarily commodity pulps like high-yield cellulose and paperboards). \n\nFounded in 2014 as a spin-off from Rayonier Inc., RYAM emphasizes sustainable bio-based materials as alternatives to petrochemicals. It produces over 20 specialty products, leveraging proprietary purification technologies for applications in thickeners, stabilizers, and performance enhancers. With ~2,500 employees, RYAM generated ~$1.65B in trailing 12-month revenue (as of Q2 2024). However, it has faced persistent challenges from high debt (~$800M pre-bankruptcy), volatile pulp prices, and operational inefficiencies, culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on September 30, 2024. The restructuring aims to reduce debt by ~75% via a prepackaged plan supported by 97% of senior secured lenders, with court approval targeted by year-end 2024. Post-emergence, RYAM expects to operate with a leaner balance sheet, focusing on HPC growth amid bio-economy trends.

(CNC, ongoing); Solvay (pharma cellulose JV exploration).\n- **M&A**: None recent; sold Tembec assets 2020. Post-bankruptcy: No plans announced.\n- **Major Clients**: Kimberly-Clark (20%+ revenue, hygiene products); Procter & Gamble (food thickeners); BASF (industrial coatings). Potential: EV battery firms (CNC for separators); aviation fuel majors (lignin pilots).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-quartile sustainability (S&P Global); 100% certified wood sourcing.\n- **Management**: CEO De Lyle Bloomquist (since 2020) praised for restructuring prep; 97% lender vote signals credibility.\n- **Sentiment**: Bearish short-term (bankruptcy); bullish long-term on HPC (Seeking Alpha \"Buy\" post-reorg ratings).\n- **Risks**: Restructuring delays; pulp price volatility (±30% swings).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n**Buy Rating: 4/10 (Sell)**  \nRationale: Bankruptcy overhang caps upside near-term; stock down 90% YTD. Fundamentals weak (Q2 loss-making), but deleveraging could unlock HPC value. Moderate risk appetite unsuited—high volatility expected.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $2.50/share** (Post-restructuring, 2025; 5x 2026E EBITDA of $100M, 50% dilution-adjusted; implies 270% upside for growth portfolios if HPC grows 10%+ annually). Hold cash until emergence (~Q1 2025). Verified inputs: Q2 2024 earnings (Aug 6), bankruptcy filings (Sept 30), stock data (Oct 10).",

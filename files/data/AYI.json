Pipeline: bolt-ons in IoT (~$50–100M).\n- **Major Clients**: Walmart, Amazon (warehouse lighting); federal govt (GSA schedules); hyperscalers (data centers via nLight). Top 10 clients ~20% revenue.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Hold for current shareholders; Buy on dips for growth upside. Rationale: Resilient FY2024 beat, ISG acceleration (high-margin 30%+), undervalued vs. peers (EV/EBITDA 14x vs. sector 18x). Construction headwinds priced in; 5–7% CAGR with 22% margins supports re-rating.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $340 (19% upside). DCF-based (5% terminal growth, 9% WACC, FY2025 EBITDA $850M); aligns with 22x forward EPS on $15.50 FY2025 consensus. Moderate risk: Cyclical exposure offset by 45% recurring ISG revenue goal.\n\n(Sources: Aggregated from Bloomberg, FactSet, company IR, analyst notes Oct 2024.)",

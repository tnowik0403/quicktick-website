Analysis proceeds on UNH as the intended subject, verified via Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, SEC filings, and company IR site (as of November 1, 2024).\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of market close Nov 1, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $585.04 |\n| Market Capitalization | $540.3 billion |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $630.73 / $436.38 |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | 29.8 |\n| Dividend Yield | 1.48% ($8.40 annualized) |\n\n## Company Overview (212 words)\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) is the largest health insurer and healthcare services company in the United States by revenue and market cap, operating a diversified model across two primary segments: UnitedHealthcare (insurance) and Optum (health services). UnitedHealthcare provides health insurance plans to ~51 million members (as of Q3 2024), including employer-sponsored, individual, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid coverage. Optum, contributing ~50% of profits, encompasses Optum Health (care delivery), Optum Rx (pharmacy benefits management, #2 PBM with 25% market share), Optum Insight (data/tech/analytics), and Optum Financial (consumer-directed benefits). \n\nFounded in 1977, UNH leverages scale for cost efficiencies, vertical integration (e.g., owning clinics, pharmacies), and data analytics to manage care costs and outcomes. In 2023, it served 1 in 10 Americans, with revenues of $371.6B. Recent focus includes expanding value-based care, home health, and AI-driven personalization amid aging demographics (Baby Boomers entering MA). Challenges include regulatory pressures on MA reimbursements and cyber risks (e.g., Feb 2024 Change Healthcare hack). UNH's moat stems from network density, sticky employer contracts, and Optum's high-margin growth (~17% revenue CAGR past 5 years), positioning it as a defensive growth play in a $4.5T U.S. healthcare market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported Oct 17, 2024):** Revenues $100.8B (+9.3% YoY); Adjusted EPS $7.15 (beat estimates by $0.27); Optum revenues $64.1B (+18%); UnitedHealthcare revenues $84.6B (+6%).

(NASDAQ: PSNL) is a precision oncology company specializing in advanced genomic sequencing and analytics for cancer diagnostics and monitoring. Founded in 2011 and public since 2019, it leverages proprietary technologies like the ImmunoID NeXT platform to deliver tumor-informed molecular residual disease (MRD) testing and comprehensive tumor profiling. Its flagship product, NeXT Personal, is a personalized liquid biopsy test that detects circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with high sensitivity using whole-genome sequencing matched to a patient's unique tumor profile. This enables minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment post-treatment, immunotherapy response monitoring, and early relapse detection across solid tumors like breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.\n\nPersonalis serves biopharma sponsors (80%+ revenue) for clinical trials and a growing number of health systems for clinical use. It operates in the $10B+ liquid biopsy market, emphasizing tumor-naive alternatives' limitations by offering >95% sensitivity in MRD via personalized panels. With ~200 employees, headquartered in Fremont, CA, Personalis reported Q2 2024 revenue of $10.5M (verified from Aug 7, 2024 earnings). The company is positioned at the intersection of genomics and AI-driven analytics, aiming to transform cancer care from reactive to proactive.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 1, 2024**: GRAIL, Inc.

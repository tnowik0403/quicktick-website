Founded in 2015 as a spin-off from Darden Restaurants, FCPT targets \"operator-led\" concepts in the quick-service restaurant (QSR), fast-casual, and polished casual dining segments, emphasizing mission-critical locations with investment-grade or top credit tenants. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), its portfolio comprises 1,015 properties across 45 states and Puerto Rico, with a 99.8% occupancy rate, weighted average remaining lease term of 8.5 years (including options), and 101.4% annualized base rent coverage based on tenants' trailing 12-month EBITDA. Rental revenues are 100% triple-net lease structure, shifting expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance) to tenants, providing predictable cash flows with built-in rent escalators averaging 1.7% annually. Key tenants include Darden Restaurants (29.4% of rent, e.g., Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse), Applebee's (11.1%), and Burger King (6.9%). FCPT has executed 326 investments totaling $3.0 billion since inception, with a disciplined cap rate discipline around 6-7%. The company benefits from a niche focus in the resilient restaurant sector, which represents ~1% of total U.S. retail real estate but offers defensive qualities amid economic cycles due to essential dining demand.

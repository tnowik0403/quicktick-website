Founded in 1907 as a bicycle messenger service in Seattle, UPS has evolved into a Fortune 100 company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with approximately 500,000 employees worldwide. The company operates one of the largest aviation fleets (over 500 aircraft) and ground fleets (more than 125,000 vehicles) globally, handling over 24 million packages daily. UPS segments its business into U.S. Domestic Package (ground and air services within the U.S.), International Package (exports, imports, and domestic services abroad), and Supply Chain Solutions (forwarding, logistics, and distribution). In 2023, UPS delivered 5.7 billion packages, generating revenue primarily from small and middle-market (SMB) customers (now ~45% of U.S. volume post-Amazon de minimis changes). Beyond parcels, UPS offers freight forwarding, customs brokerage, and specialized healthcare logistics via UPS Healthcare. The company's integrated network emphasizes efficiency through technologies like ORION (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation), which saves ~100 million miles annually. UPS invests heavily in sustainability, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050, and is pivoting toward higher-margin healthcare and SMB segments amid e-commerce shifts.

This makes United Parcel Service the world's 245th most valuable company according to our data.\n\nMarket Cap: $91.261B; Shares Outstanding: 848.39M; Dividend Yield: 6.10%; Beta: 1.09; EPS (TTM): $6.47; P/E (TTM): 16.62; Revenue (TTM): $89.483B; ROE (TTM): 33.67%.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nUPS is a publicly traded company, and its business is divided into three main segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package, and Supply Chain & Freight. The U.S. Domestic Package segment is the largest and accounts for the majority of the company's revenue. This segment provides ground and air delivery services for packages and documents within the United States. The International Package segment provides air and ground delivery services for packages and documents to more than 220 countries and territories. The Supply Chain & Freight segment provides logistics and supply chain management services, including transportation management, freight brokerage, and customs brokerage.\n\nThe company offers a range of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services; day-definite services; cross-border ground package delivery; contract-only, e-commerce solutions for non-urgent, and cross-border shipments; and international service for urgent and palletized shipments. It also provides international air and ocean freight forwarding, contract logistics, custom brokerage and insurance, mail services, healthcare logistics, distribution, and post-sales services.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) is doubling down on its customer-first strategy by expanding its end-to-end portfolio with two ground shipping options for residential and commercial shippers: UPS Ground Saver® and UPS® Ground with Freight Pricing. \"UPS is on a mission to transform our customer experience by offering an end-to-end portfolio which provides delivery, returns and pickup services seven-days-a-week,\" said UPS Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer Matt Guffey. \"Ground Saver and Ground with Freight Pricing represent the first of many product enhancements UPS will roll out in 2025.\" UPS Ground Saver is a reliable, economical shipping solution for less urgent packages, leveraging the UPS® Smart Logistics Network.\n\nUPS is deploying more innovative technology like RFID, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation than ever before. The company made great progress in 2024 with the rollout of Smart Package Smart Facility. More than half of our U.S. package cars are now equipped with RFID readers and our new label technology enables customers to print their shipping labels with RFID embedded right in the label.\n\nOne product UPS has developed is UPS Premier, which uses RFID and cellular sensor technology to notify its network operators that a package has urgent or temperature-sensitive materials inside. It can also provide precise location information, such as where a package is on an aircraft, for easy intervention if inclement weather or other issues occur during the shipping process.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nUPS is positioning itself under a \"better and bolder\" approach to become the premium small package provider and logistics partner in the world. Over the next three years, UPS plans to make bold moves to create a growth flywheel in premium markets, while at the same time drive higher productivity and efficiency. During the conference, UPS will highlight several strategic initiatives that will enable market share capture and expand its addressable market to drive incremental growth.\n\nUPS is leaning into Healthcare, SMB, B2B and International to power future growth. As planned, UPS is accelerating the glide down of Amazon volume and U.S. network reconfiguration, while deploying additional automation through its Network of the Future initiative. That strategy is paying off, as Carol and Brian outlined strong expense control and revenue-per-piece improvement that helped deliver U.S. operating margin expansion in the third quarter year-over-year.\n\n\"We've reached an agreement in principle with our largest customer for a significant reduction in volume, lowering their volume with us by more than 50% by the second half of 2026,\" Tome told investors. \"With this, we will right-size our network and retain the volume that is nutritive for us and for our customer.\"\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nUPS serves approximately 3.4 million package delivery customers daily. In 2022, individual consumer shipping volume reached 6.7 billion packages globally. UPS supports over 2.3 million small and medium-sized business customers worldwide. These businesses generate approximately $43.2 billion in revenue for UPS annually. UPS serves 82% of Fortune 500 companies, generating $61.5 billion from enterprise-level customers in 2022.\n\nCEO Carol Tome told investors on the carrier's Q4 earnings call that it grew its U.S. small and medium-size business (SMB) penetration in 2024. UPS finished the year with SMBs comprising 28.9% of its total U.S. volume, a 0.3% year-over-year increase.\n\nUPS also credited UPS' digital access program (DAP), as it generated $3.3 billion in global revenue. That's a 17% year-over-year increase.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Quarterly Performance\nFor 2024, revenue was $91.1 billion. Operating profit of $8.5 billion; non-GAAP adjusted operating profit of $8.9 billion. Operating margin was 9.3%; non-GAAP adjusted operating margin was 9.8%. Diluted EPS totaled $6.75; non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $7.72. Cash from operations was $10.1 billion.\n\n### Q4 2024 Results\nUPS announced fourth-quarter 2024 consolidated revenues of $25.3 billion, a 1.5% increase from the fourth quarter of 2023. Consolidated operating profit was $2.9 billion, up 18.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and up 11.2% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Diluted earnings per share were $2.01 for the quarter; non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.75, 11.3% above the same period in 2023.\n\n### Cost Management\nThe company expects $3.5 billion in total year-over-year cost savings for 2025, which rivals its annual capital expenditure budget. UPS's \"Transformation 2.0\" slashed 34,000 jobs, closed 93 sites and saved $2.2 billion this year. By closing 93 facilities and eliminating 34,000 operational positions during the first nine months of 2025, the company realized $2.2 billion in cost savings. The company expects $3.5 billion in total year-over-year cost savings for 2025.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Healthcare Logistics Growth**: UPS is boosting its healthcare logistics business through in-house expansion and outside acquisitions. The carrier wants to reach $20 billion in annual healthcare revenue by 2026 — doubling what it made in 2023.\n\n- **E-commerce and Digital Services**: UPS Digital, a key segment, is experiencing robust growth. Services like ROE and Happy Returns contributed to a substantial 32.5% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n- **Automation and Technology**: UPS is moving from a scanning network to a sensing network through its \"smart package, smart facility, RFID initiative.\" UPS equipped nearly 60,000 package cars with RFID sensors in 2024, which represent 66% of its fleet.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Volume Pressures**: UPS has experienced notable volume declines in recent years, with parcel volume dropping 10.3% from 2022 to 2023. Revenue also declined 6.4% year-over-year in 2023.\n\n- **Amazon Relationship**: UPS announced in January 2025 that it will slash volumes it handles for Amazon by 50% over the next 18 months as it focuses on higher-yield freight.\n\n- **Trade Policy Uncertainty**: The company is closely monitoring potential trade policy adjustments, especially in the U.S.-China corridor. International revenues are expected to decline about 2%, mainly due to weakening demand on China-to-U.S. lanes.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nUPS currently holds approximately 20-23% of the U.S. parcel delivery market by volume, making it the second-largest traditional carrier behind USPS but ahead of FedEx. However, the company's market position has shifted significantly as Amazon Logistics has captured roughly 28% of parcel volume. By volume, UPS handled 4.6 billion packages in 2023, representing about 20-23% of the U.S. parcel market. This positions UPS as the second-largest carrier overall, trailing USPS (31% market share, 6.9 billion packages in 2024) but ahead of FedEx (15% market share, 3.4 billion packages).\n\nUPS's revenue share (35% in 2023) significantly exceeds its volume share (20-23%), indicating the company's success in capturing higher-value shipments. UPS remains the largest traditional parcel carrier by revenue, generating approximately $68.9 billion in parcel revenue during 2023.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nGlobally, FedEx's courier revenue share sits at approximately 7%, behind UPS (11%) and DHL (15%). This reflects FedEx's premium positioning and concentration in North American markets. The two American logistics giants compete directly across most service categories, with UPS maintaining revenue leadership.\n\nUPS went from $58B revenue in 2013 to leading the pack with $91B in the trailing twelve months. UPS is also the most valuable of the three major carriers with over $120B market cap (basically equal to the sum of the value of its two main contenders) and is by far the most profitable of the three (TTM): $6.7B versus $4.3B (of FedEx and DHL).\n\nCarriers outside of FedEx, UPS, the U.S. Postal Service and Amazon's logistics arm delivered 2.3 billion packages domestically in 2024, up 44% from the year prior. In turn, their market share by volume grew from 7% to 10%. Most U.S. parcel volume growth over the next three years will come from the private networks of Amazon, Walmart and other retailers, \"resulting in a flat to negative growth for UPS, FedEx and USPS.\"\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) announced on January 8, 2025 that it has completed the acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, which provide industry-leading, complex healthcare logistics solutions across Europe.\n\nUPS announced that it has agreed to acquire Frigo-Trans, and its sister company BPL, industry-leading, complex healthcare logistics providers based in Germany. Frigo-Trans' network includes temperature-controlled warehousing that covers six temperature zones from cryopreservation (-196°C) to ambient (+15° to +25°C); a Pan-European cold chain transportation solution and temperature-controlled and time-critical freight forwarding capabilities.\n\n### Cancelled Acquisition\nUPS said Thursday it has ended plans to acquire Mexican express delivery and logistics company Estafeta because the companies were unable to satisfy all closing conditions. In a Form 8-K statement issued last week, UPS said that it, \"terminated its plans to acquire Estafeta due to the inability of all closing conditions to be satisfied.\"\n\n### Asset Disposals\nUPS completed a divestiture of its Coyote Logistics business within Supply Chain Solutions during 2024, generating a pre-tax gain of $156 million.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Operational Changes (2024-2025)\nUPS previously announced initiatives under Fit to Serve to right-size its business through a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions throughout 2024 and create a more efficient operating model to enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics.\n\nUPS achieved approximately $1.0 billion in savings from its Fit to Serve initiative. The company also remains laser focused on driving greater productivity from the assets it owns. UPS is deploying more innovative technology like RFID, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation than ever before. The company made great progress in 2024 with the rollout of Smart Package Smart Facility.\n\n### Strategic Repositioning\nUPS is accelerating its \"glide down\" of Amazon volume, with plans to reduce Amazon packages by more than 50% by June 2026. UPS aims to reach a 12% U.S. operating margin by the end of 2026, up from 7% in Q1 2025. The company is betting that shedding unprofitable volume and streamlining operations will create a more profitable, agile business model.\n\n### Sustainability Initiatives\nUPS is very close to reaching its 2025 goals for 25% renewable electricity and 40% of alternative fuel use – a milestone on its way to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The company powered its global facilities with 15% renewable electricity and a whopping 30% of ground fuel came from alternative sources.\n\n## 13.

PT $98, Barclays \"Overweight\" Oct 2024); online forums (Reddit/StockTwits) bullish on unlock but cautious on freight cycle.\n- **Risks**: Freight downturn prolongation; spin-off execution (regulatory/tax hurdles).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy). Spin-off catalyst + margin recovery support upside amid stabilizing freight (Cass Freight Index +1.2% Sep 2024). Moderate risk from cyclicality, but asset-light model resilient.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $125/share (17% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth), incorporating spin value (~$15/share NAST) and 10% EBITDA CAGR to 2026. Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns.",

Robinson Managed Solutions™, the next generation of logistics management. This innovation will solve a growing gap in the market for shippers wanting seamless access to cutting-edge TMS technology, 3PL managed transportation and 4PL services from one provider, at scale , with unmatched configurability , as supply chains grow increasingly complex .\n\nBut the company this week is announcing the adoption of an AI-driven tool, the Always-on Logistics Planner, in its 4PL offering C.H.

Growth Strategy\n\nWe've talked extensively over the past year about our new Robinson operating model and the disciplined execution that the model is enabling, as well as how we're leveraging our industry leading talent and technology to raise the bar in logistics. In what continues to be a historically prolonged freight recession, with market growth in 2024 that did not materialize as had been projected, the difference in our execution versus last year is stark. Our people are embracing the discipline needed to generate higher highs and higher lows across market cycles, resulting in a higher quality of volume, greater productivity, and an expansion of our gross profit and operating profit margins.\n\nManagement at the giant logistics company has been consistently on-message about their technology gains, citing growing use of AI to drive processes more efficiently (and with fewer workers) as a key reason for the way it has outperformed its peers. Much of the talk by C.H. Robinson CEO Dave Bozeman (NASDAQ: CHRW) in calls with analysts and other forums has focused on the impact of AI in the company's primary business, its brokerage operations in its North America Surface Transportation (NAST) segment.\n\nAutomation and AI Expansion: Management believes ongoing investment in generative AI and automation will further decouple headcount from volume, supporting margin expansion and business scalability regardless of market cycles. Customer Supply Chain Shifts: The company expects continued resilience from supporting customers' efforts to diversify sourcing and adapt to changing tariff regimes, potentially lifting demand for customs and managed supply chain solutions. Cost Flexibility and Lean Operations: Ongoing productivity initiatives and dynamic workforce planning are expected to help maintain or improve operating margins, even if freight demand remains subdued or volatile.\n\n## 6.

Robinson is one of the world's largest logistics platforms, with $23 billion in freight under management and 2024 total revenues of $17.7 billion.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Financial Highlights:**\nGross profits increased 10.4% to $672.9 million Income from operations increased 71.1% to $183.8 million Adjusted operating margin increased 940 basis points to 26.8% Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 369.2% to $1.22\n\n**Full Year 2024 Performance:**\nGross profits increased 5.8% to $2.7 billion Income from operations increased 30.0% to $669.1 million\n\n**Q3 2024 Performance:**\nGross profits increased 15.5% to $723.8 million Income from operations increased 58.7% to $180.1 million Adjusted operating margin increased 660 basis points to 24.5%\n\nMarket Cap19.612B · Shares Out118.14M · 10 Day Average Volume1.19M · Dividend2.52 · Dividend Yield1.52% Beta0.90 · EPS (TTM)4.93 · P/E (TTM)33.65 · Fwd P/E (NTM)29.28 · EBITDA (TTM)922.545M · ROE (TTM)34.32% Revenue (TTM)16.505B · Gross Margin (TTM)16.70% Net Margin (TTM)3.64%\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\nIn what continues to be a historically prolonged freight recession, with market growth in 2024 that did not materialize as had been projected\n\nTruckload industry pricing headwinds from excess capacity will probably linger into the first half of 2026, assuming tariff headwinds constrain demand.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nC.H. Robinson's turnaround since the start of 2024, evidenced most clearly in its rising stock price for more than a year, has been attributed to many factors, a strengthening freight market certainly not being one of them. (C.H. Robinson stock hit yet another 52-week high Wednesday at $128.46 and is up about 24.6% just in the last month). Management at the giant logistics company has been consistently on-message about their technology gains, citing growing use of AI to drive processes more efficiently (and with fewer workers) as a key reason for the way it has outperformed its peers.\n\nAs a result, our ocean and air shipments grew each quarter on a year-over-year basis, and each grew more than 5% for the full year. Through improvements in process standardization and automation and embracing the rigor of our operating model, the forwarding team decoupled headcount growth from volume growth, reduced their average headcount for the year more than 10%, and achieved productivity improvement of greater than 15% for the full year.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nCH Robinson has a 17% marketshare; Landstar has 6%; XPO has 5%; TQL and Coyote control 4% each, and Echo Global has 3% of the US brokerage market. The other 61% is 'other', i.e, small brokerages. There is still plenty of room for large brokerages to grow larger through consolidation rather than stealing each other's marketshare.\n\nHunt has established a robust leadership position in intermodal , with a 20%-plus share of an approximate $25 billion industry. This shows C.H. Robinson operates in a competitive but fragmented market with significant consolidation opportunities.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\nJ.B.

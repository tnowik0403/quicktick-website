In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

(MORN) is a Chicago-based global leader in independent investment research, data, and analytics, serving individual investors, financial advisors, asset managers, and institutions. Founded in 1984, it provides data on over 600,000 investment offerings, including mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, and alternatives, across 220+ countries. Core offerings include the star ratings system (pioneered in 1985), portfolio tools, and software platforms. Revenue is segmented into Morningstar Research Services (52% of Q2 2024 revenue: data/tools for advisors/institutions), PitchBook (36%: private market data), Morningstar Sustainalytics (8%: ESG ratings), and DBRS Morningstar (4%: credit ratings). With ~11,000 employees, Morningstar emphasizes data-driven insights, AI integration, and sustainable investing. It derives ~70% of revenue from subscriptions, ensuring recurring stability. Recent expansion into private markets via PitchBook (acquired 2021) and AI-powered tools positions it for growth amid rising demand for alternatives and ESG data.

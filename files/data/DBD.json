Headquartered in North Hudson, Ohio, with ~21,000 employees worldwide, the company designs, manufactures, deploys, and services hardware, software, and integrated systems that enable secure, efficient self-service transactions. In banking, DBD dominates with automated teller machines (ATMs), cash recyclers, and digital banking software; in retail, it provides point-of-sale (POS) terminals, kiosks, and checkout automation. \n\nFounded from the 2016 merger of Diebold (est. 1859) and Nixdorf Computer, DBD operates in ~100 countries, generating ~70% of revenue from services (recurring) and the rest from hardware/software. Fiscal 2023 revenue was $3.76 billion, with a focus on software margins (60%+ gross). The company shifted post-merger toward high-margin services (45% of gross profit) amid declining hardware sales due to digital shifts. Recent restructuring addressed $2.4B debt via a 2023 RCF amendment and 2024 exchange offers. DBD targets \"banking everywhere\" and frictionless retail, leveraging AI-driven software like Vynamic Cloud for ATMs and Retail X suite. Challenges include legacy debt and cyclical hardware, but tailwinds from global ATM/branch modernization support mid-single-digit growth.

Company Overview\n\nCritical Metals Corp operates as a mining exploration and development company in Austria and Southern Greenland, exploring for lithium and rare earth element deposits. The company is a leading mining development company focused on critical metals and minerals, producing strategic products essential to electrification and next generation technologies for Europe and its western world partners. The company is based in Road Town, British Virgin Islands and is a subsidiary of European Lithium Limited. \n\nThe company's flagship asset, the Tanbreez Project, is a permitted, globally significant critical minerals asset positioned to unlock a sustainable, reliable and long-term rare earth supply for North America and Europe. Once operational, Tanbreez is expected to supply rare earth elements (REEs) to customers in the western hemisphere to support the production of a wide range of next-generation commercial products, as well as demand from the defense industry. The Wolfsberg Lithium Project is located 270 km southwest of Vienna in Austria's Carinthia region and is the first fully permitted mine in Europe, strategically located with access to established road and rail infrastructure and expected to be the next major producer of key lithium products to support the European market.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nCritical Metals (CRML) stock is priced at $13.56, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.6 billion. As of January 7, 2026, the market capitalization of CRML is $1.63B. The stock's 52-week range extends from a low of $1.23 to a high of $32.15. Critical Metals has surged 115% so far in 2026, and the stock had also climbed another 12% in premarket trading. Revenue (ttm) is $560.62k with Net Income Available to Common (ttm) of -$51.87M and Diluted EPS (ttm) of -$0.56.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nCritical Metals Corp is currently a development-stage mining company with two primary asset portfolios:\n\n**Tanbreez Rare Earth Project (Greenland):**\n- Expected to possess greater than 27% heavy rare earth elements (HREE), which carry a much higher value than light rare earth elements. In an industry where competitors primarily target light rare earth elements (LREE), Tanbreez is believed to be unique due to its significant size and HREE asset mix.\n- Tanbreez management has estimated the resource at 4.7 billion tonnes, including 28.2 million tonnes of total rare earth oxides.\n- The Tanbreez tenure is a Mineral Exploitation Licence, MIN 2020-54, in southern Greenland covering 18km2.\n\n**Wolfsberg Lithium Project (Austria):**\n- Backed by over four decades of exploration data dating back to the 1980s, the project boasts a S-K1300 compliant mineral resource and has advanced through multiple stages of technical validation—including detailed engineering assessments and a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS).\n- The company is expected to deliver a new definitive feasibility study for the Wolfsberg lithium project in the first quarter of 2025, incorporating a second mineralized zone that could potentially double the current resource of 12.9 million tonnes at an average lithium oxide grade of 1% and support a mine life of 20 years.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Tanbreez Development Timeline:**\n- Commercial production remains distant, with initial output targeted for 2028 at 85,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides annually. The company has secured offtake agreements for 75% of planned output, with additional agreements expected to be signed in early 2026.\n- The pilot-plant section is scheduled to be ready for use on or before May 2026.\n- Critical Metals Corp ordered a turnkey Integrated Mobile Geochemical Analysis Centre from Bromet for approximately US$1m to support the Tanbreez rare earth elements project and pilot plant activities. This acquisition represents a significant investment in technical capability and underscores the Company's commitment to operating as a world-class mining organization.\n\n**Wolfsberg Production Timeline:**\n- The company's Wolfsberg lithium project represents the first fully permitted spodumene mine on the continent, with first production targeted for 2026/2027.\n\n**Processing Infrastructure:**\n- Critical Metals teamed up with the Obeikan Group to build a lithium hydroxide processing plant in Saudi Arabia. Once commissioned, the refinery – to be held under a 50/50 joint venture – is expected to produce up to 20,000 tonnes of battery-grade material and will be the first lithium hydroxide processing plant within the Middle East North Africa region.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Strategic Asset Development:**\nCritical Metals Corp plans to have the ability to further support its commercial network in Europe while simultaneously being able to evaluate additional opportunities to tap into the upside potential of the North American market.\n\n**Geographic Diversification:**\nThe company has executed strategic offtake deals with ReAlloys and UCORE, and a term sheet that unites a powerhouse team to deliver a world-class, EU-based rare earth operation. Both CRML and the Romanian government will apply for the recently announced €3.5 billion package for the supply of rare earth metals to the EU.\n\n**Technological Advancement:**\nCRML in consultation with the Romanian offtake partners have shown that an increase in the grade of concentrate from Greenland is essential. To achieve these higher-grade concentrates, the Company is now investigating a redesigned process that will increase the concentrate grade from 2.2-2.5% to in excess of 3% TREEs Eudialyte concentrate.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Confirmed Offtake Partners:**\n- Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW) has transferred funds of US$15 million to ECM Lithium AT GmbH for the offtake of battery grade lithium hydroxide from the Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Austria.\n- Critical Metals Corp expects to supply up to 10,000 metric tons annually of rare earth concentrate from its Tanbreez Project to Ucore Rare Metals Inc, representing approximately 10% of the project's initial projected production. The concentrate will be used as feedstock for Ucore's rare earth element processing facility in Alexandria, Louisiana and Kingston, Ontario.\n- The company signed a Letter of Intent for an offtake agreement with REalloys Inc., a private company completing an S-4 merger to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker BLBX. REalloys is one of the only U.S. companies with integrated midstream and downstream rare earth capabilities.\n\n**Strategic Government Partnerships:**\n- Critical Metals Corp executed the Term-Sheet for creating a 50%-50% joint venture between CRML and Fabrica de Prelucrare a Concentratelor de Uraniu S.R.L. (FPCU) of Romania, a state-owned entity and a strategic partner from a European Union and NATO member country. The term sheet provides CRML with long-term offtake rights for 50% of the entire Tanbreez concentrate production.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2025, Critical Metals's revenue was $560,623, an increase of 376.48% compared to the previous year's $117,660. Losses were -$51.87 million, -62.80% less than in 2024. Revenue for the trailing twelve months was $560,620, while the company maintains $7.3 million in total cash against a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio of 6.40%. Return on equity stands at -128.30%, reflecting ongoing operational losses.\n\nRight now, Critical Metals is still unprofitable and burning cash (FCF yield: –36.18% vs. market's 1.82%). Its Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is deep in the red at –92.22% (market average: 11.03%), dragged down by heavy upfront investment and write-offs. On the upside, the net debt/EBITDA ratio is just 0.15x (market average: 1.41x), so the company isn't weighed down by debt.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Rare Earth Market Position:**\nCritical Metals Corp signed a binding heads of agreement to acquire a controlling interest in the Tanbreez Greenland Rare Earth Mine, one of the largest rare earth deposits in the world. With China dominating more than 90% of the REEs, Critical Metals Corp's acquisition of the mine strategically would establish it as a reliable supplier of critical minerals for the western world.\n\n**Secured Market Share:**\nTogether with the recent off-take agreement signed with Ucore, this takes the total to 25% of the total production of the Tanbreez project for US customers. Critical Metals' 50/50 Romania JV secures 50% of Tanbreez concentrate, lifting long-term offtake to 75% and creating a NATO-aligned EU rare earth chain.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nCritical Metals has plenty of competition among junior explorers and developers (think Lithium Americas, MP Materials, Lynas Corp.), but its projects stand out: it's one of the few rare earth names under Western control, and it's been getting growing strategic support from the US government—keen to shore up supply chains for clean energy and defense.\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n- Its unique, Western-controlled assets and the chance of meaningful US government support, giving it a possible edge in the rare earth supply chain.\n- Other US-listed rare earth companies like Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML) and USA Rare Earth Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR), along with Energy Fuels Inc., are experiencing gains as beneficiaries of Western diversification efforts.\n\n**Competitive Landscape:**\n- MP Materials (No. 3) operates Mountain Pass in California, the only rare-earth elements mining operation in the U.S. The company produces rare-earth magnets and materials in Texas.\n- Lynas Rare Earths (No. 1) mines for rare-earth minerals at its Mt. Weld mine in Australia and produces rare-earth materials at its processing plants in Australia and Malaysia.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Acquisitions:**\n- Under the terms of the amended agreement, Critical Metals Corp now has the right to increase its ownership stake in the Tanbreez Project from 42% to 92.5% upon the issuance of approximately 14.5 million ordinary shares of the Company to Rimbal. Critical Metals Corp is required to consummate the increase in ownership promptly upon receipt of Greenland governmental approval of the transaction.\n\n**Strategic Joint Ventures:**\n- Critical Metals Corp and the Obeikan Group incorporated Arabian New Energy Corp, a 50%/50% joint venture company which is geared towards developing, constructing and commissioning a lithium hydroxide processing plant. Arabian New Energy Corp has appointed Hatch Ltd. to commence design work on a lithium refinery in Saudi Arabia, which is expected to produce up to 20,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.\n\n**Government Partnerships:**\n- MP Materials received a $400 million preferred equity investment from the Pentagon. The Trump administration has bought a stake in several publicly traded U.S. companies it considers essential to the nation's national security. This includes three critical minerals companies -- Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, and rare-earth elements company MP Materials.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Construction and Development Milestones:**\n- Critical Metals Corp (NASDAQ: CRML) has approved and started construction of an Arctic-grade multi-use building in Qaqortoq, Greenland to support the Tanbreez rare earths project. The works are under a full turnkey contract with 60° North Greenland covering design, permitting, logistics, construction and commissioning. The facility (~80m x 20m, 10m clear height) is divided into three sections with mezzanines for offices and is engineered for Arctic conditions.\n\n**Geopolitical Catalysts:**\n- In the past week, Critical Metals Corp, a company with a mining project in development on the Arctic island, has fielded questions from tech investors about how the U.S. acquiring Greenland would impact that asset and its development strategy. Sage said U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Greenland had generated additional \"buzz\" for the project from investors.\n- Critical Metals stock jumped 12% in pre-market trading following President Trump's comments about acquiring Greenland for national security reasons. Shares of Critical Metals Corp. surged nearly 12% during Monday's pre-market trading session, reaching $16.81.\n\n**Regulatory Progress:**\n- Critical Metals Corp has received a notice from the Carinthian state government that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required for the Wolfsberg Lithium Project, which is strategically located in Austria. This is an important step on the way to realizing the project and establishing a European battery supply chain for electromobility.\n\n## 12.

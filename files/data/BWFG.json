Attractive valuation (0.85x TBV, 7x fwd P/E vs. peer 11x), resilient NIM/deposits, and 15-20% upside to fair value. Growth upside from C&I shift, but CRE headwinds cap to moderate risk (suits profile). Hold for dividend; buy on dips <$25.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $33 (20% upside). Derived from 1.0x TBV ($25 book) + 25% premium for 14% ROE + 5% growth (DCF: 10% discount rate, 4% perp growth; aligns KBW/analyst PTs). Strong growth potential if CRE stabilizes.",

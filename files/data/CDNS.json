Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nIn January 2026, Cadence announced a Chiplet Spec-to-Packaged Parts ecosystem to reduce engineering complexity and accelerate time to market for customers developing chiplets targeting physical AI, data center, and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. To help reduce risk and streamline customer adoption, Cadence is collaborating with Samsung Foundry to build out a silicon prototype demonstration of the Cadence® Physical AI chiplet platform, including pre-integrated partner IP on the Samsung Foundry SF5A process.\n\nIn September 2023, Cadence released software called ChipGPT, allowing companies to create custom silicon with assistance from AI. Therefore, we have massive investment in agentic AI, which you will see as we announce more products going forward. And we already have several partnerships in there, and we are highlighting one of them.\n\nCadence's Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express(UCIe) IP provides industry-standard die-to-die connectivity, with a protocol IP portfolio that enables fast integration of interfaces such as LPDDR6/5X, DDR5-MRDIMM, PCI Express (PCIe) 7.0, and HBM4.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe company applies its underlying Intelligent System Design strategy to deliver software, hardware, and IP that turn design concepts into reality. Recognizing that chips don't live in isolation, Cadence expanded into system-level analysis, multi-physics simulation, and drug design. This broadened the total addressable market far beyond traditional semiconductor companies, leading to a record backlog of $7.0 billion as of Q3 2025.\n\nRecent acquisitions, including ARM Artisan Foundation IP and Hexagon's MSC software, are expanding Cadence's capabilities and market reach. And it will actually the run rate should cross a billion dollars in 2026 if the acquisition closes.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCadence developed advanced verification platforms supporting multiple design domains, with over 90% of Fortune 500 technology companies utilizing their tools. By late 2022, Cadence had clients such as Tesla and Apple Inc. Cadence supports 75% of top aerospace and defense technology companies. As of 2023, Cadence serves 88% of global consumer electronics manufacturers.\n\nYes, NVIDIA uses both. Yes. All these guys. They want to keep it to equal within the company because that gives them price. The largest chip design companies, such as NVIDIA, AMD and Broadcom, are likely to have similar full-service pricing contracts with EDA vendors.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nRecord Backlog of $7.0 Billion Raising 2025 Revenue Outlook to ~14% Growth YoY. \"I am pleased to report that Cadence delivered strong results for the third quarter of 2025, with broad-based momentum across all our businesses,\" said John Wall, senior vice president and chief financial officer. \"Strong financial and operational performance resulted in Q3 backlog of $7.0 billion, putting us on track to deliver a strong 2025.\"\n\nTotal revenue was $1.339 billion, GAAP operating margin was 31.8%, and non-GAAP operating margin 47.6%. GAAP EPS was $1.05 with non-GAAP EPS $1.93. Revenues for 2025 are now estimated to be in the range of $5.262-$5.292 billion compared with $5.21-$5.27 billion guided earlier. Non-GAAP EPS for 2025 is expected to be between $7.02 and $7.08 compared with $6.85-$6.95 guided earlier.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, Cadence Design Systems reported R&D expenses of $1.1 billion, representing 31.7% of total revenue. Cadence invested approximately $250 million in talent acquisition and compensation for software engineering professionals in 2023.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\nAccelerating AI adoption is fueling growth across EDA, IP, hardware, and system analysis businesses, with Cadence highlighting strong partnerships and new wins. The accelerating AI megatrend is fueling an unprecedented wave of design activity across industries, ranging from hyperscaler infrastructure to fast-growing physical AI realm autonomous driving, drones, and robotics, to the emerging domain of science and AI.\n\nHardware Strength: Demand for hardware emulation and prototyping remains very strong and is expected to grow further into 2026.\n\n### Headwinds:\nTo be fair, while the core business is robust, geopolitical risks, especially those involving US-China relations, still have the potential to disrupt supply chains and customer demand in the short term. Cadence shares are hovering near $318 (last traded Dec. 24), after a year that featured multiple volatility catalysts: earnings beats, raised guidance, a major M&A announcement, and a series of U.S.-China policy swings that temporarily dis\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket share figures from 2024 place Synopsys at approximately 31%, Cadence at 30%, and Siemens at 13%, making it effectively a two-and-a-half-player market at the top. Synopsys and Cadence together control nearly 75% of the market, giving them significant pricing power and stability.\n\nCadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS) is a critical enabler of the modern semiconductor industry, holding a strong number two position in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe EDA market is a highly stable and entrenched oligopoly dominated by three companies: Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA (formerly Mentor Graphics). Together, these three firms command over 90% of the global EDA revenue.\n\nIt is worth noting at this point that Cadence and Synopsys are very similar in what they provide. Most large customers are customers of both, creating a best-of-breed toolset from the broader SNPS / CDNS / Mentor product suite and using each to play pricing off each other.\n\nWhile Ansys is a fantastic company with a deep moat in its own right, Cadence's operating margins (~33% vs. ~25%), ROIC (>25% vs. ~10%), and historical stock performance are simply in a different league. Cadence, on the other hand, has proven its ability to execute at the highest level, making it the stronger investment choice.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nOn September 4, 2025, Cadence Design Systems announced it would acquire the design and engineering business of Stockholm-based Hexagon AB for €2.7 billion (approximately $3.16 billion) in a stock-and-cash deal. The acquisition includes Hexagon's MSC Software business, a provider of engineering simulation and analysis software and workflows.\n\nCadence Design Systems's most recent deal was a Merger/Acquisition with ChipStack. The deal was made on 10-Nov-2025. Cadence acquired OpenEye Scientific Software for $500 million in September 2022, rebranding the company OpenEye Cadence Molecular Sciences and making it into a business unit. OpenEye signed Pfizer as a software client in October 2023.\n\nInitial IP partners joining Cadence include Arm, Arteris, eMemory, M31 Technology, Silicon Creations and Trilinear Technologies, as well as silicon analytics partner proteanTecs. To help reduce risk and streamline customer adoption, Cadence is collaborating with Samsung Foundry to build out a silicon prototype demonstration of the Cadence® Physical AI chiplet platform.\n\n## 12.

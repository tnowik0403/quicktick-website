(BBCP) is North America's leading provider of concrete pumping services, operating a fleet of approximately 1,100 specialized pumps across the U.S. and U.K. Founded through consolidation starting in 2016, the company delivers ready-mix concrete placement for large-scale construction projects, including high-rise buildings, bridges, dams, and data centers. Its services span concrete pumping (line pumps, boom pumps), concrete placement (laser-guided screeds, conventional screed work), and turnkey concrete services combining pumping and placement.\n\nBBCP operates under brands like Brundage-Bone Concrete Pumping (U.S. leader), RW Martin (U.S. placement), Concrete Pumpers UK, and Premier Cement Mixing (U.K.). The fragmented $5-6B U.S. concrete pumping market (per company 10-K) allows BBCP ~10-15% share via scale advantages in fleet utilization (85-90% target), safety (lowest EMR rating in industry), and tech integration (dispatch software). Revenue is project-based, cyclical with construction spending, with 90%+ from U.S. operations. FY2024 revenue was $490.6M (down 7% YoY due to non-core divestitures), but Q1 FY2025 (ended Dec 31, 2023) showed $112.0M revenue (-11% YoY) amid soft megaprojects; gross margin held at 29.8% (per Q1 10-Q filed Feb 6, 2024). The company targets margin expansion to 32-35% via fleet modernization and M&A.

It operates through two main business lines: Property & Casualty (P&C) reinsurance, which covers risks like natural catastrophes, specialty lines (e.g., aviation, marine, credit), and casualty; and Life & Health (L&H) reinsurance, focusing on longevity, mortality, morbidity, and health risks. SCOR serves over 300 clients worldwide, including primary insurers in more than 160 countries, with a balanced book split roughly 50/50 between P&C and L&H. The company emphasizes innovation through data analytics, AI-driven underwriting, and parametric insurance solutions. As of H1 2024, SCOR managed €15.1 billion in shareholders' equity and maintained a Solvency II ratio of 220%, reflecting strong capital adequacy. Its SCOR 2022 Ambition plan targets a 10% average return on equity (RoE) through 2025, prioritizing disciplined underwriting, capital efficiency, and digital transformation. SCOR differentiates via its \"Peace of Mind\" strategy, delivering reliable capacity to clients amid volatile markets, while navigating challenges like climate change and inflation. With a global footprint (key hubs in Paris, Zurich, London, New York, and Asia), SCOR ranks among the top 10 reinsurers by premiums, underscoring its role in stabilizing the insurance ecosystem.

(RGP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024 close, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $7.22\n- **Market Capitalization**: $244.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $6.97 - $14.42\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 248,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 12.4x\n- **Forward P/E**: 8.1x (analyst consensus)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nResources Connection, Inc. (RGP), founded in 1996 and headquartered in Irvine, California, is a professional services firm providing consulting expertise to Fortune 1000 and Global 1000 enterprises. Operating primarily through its Resources Global Professionals brand, RGP delivers flexible, project-based talent solutions in high-demand areas including finance & accounting (F&A), information technology (IT), corporate governance, risk & compliance, internal audit, program management, and human capital strategy. The company deploys over 3,000 professionals across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, emphasizing \"right-sized\" teams for targeted projects rather than full-time hires. In fiscal 2024 (ended May 31, 2024), RGP generated revenue primarily from the U.S. (85%), with billings driven by hourly consultant rates averaging $125-$200. The firm has pivoted toward higher-margin \"Valuing Practices\" (e.g., restructuring, supply chain), divesting lower-margin operations like its UK business in June 2024. RGP differentiates via its \"professional services continuum,\" blending consulting with staffing, amid a $500B+ global management consulting market. Recent challenges include macroeconomic headwinds, but restructuring positions it for niche recovery in tech-enabled advisory.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (August 1, 2024)**: Revenue $162.8M (↓3.4% YoY), net income $4.8M (↓66%), diluted EPS $0.15 (↓61.5%) vs. $0.39 prior year.

Michael (SVP, General Counsel) appointed Interim CEO.\n- **UK Business Sale (June 17, 2024)**: Sold to Mirakel for $2.6M cash, eliminating ~$20M annual low-margin revenue to focus on core markets.\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (June 20, 2024)**: FY2024 revenue $689.0M (↓10.4% YoY), net income $24.4M (↓37%), EPS $0.72 (↓38%).

U.S. professional staffing/consulting: <2% (dominated by Big 4 at 40%+).\n- **Forecast**: Mild decline to 0.4-0.8% by FY2027 due to scale disadvantage; potential stabilization if Valuing Practices hit 50% mix (mgmt. target). Organic growth -2% to +3% annually (consensus: Barclays, August 2024).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (FY2024 or Latest) | RGP | FTI Consulting (FCN) | Hackett Group (HCKT) | ASGN Inc. |\n|---------------------------|-----|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| **Revenue** | $689M | $3.5B | $288M | $4.4B |\n| **YoY Growth** | -10.4% | +15% | +9% | +2% |\n| **Gross Margin** | 32.3% | 32% | 37% | 30% |\n| **Market Cap** | $244M | $8.1B | $845M | $1.5B |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 5.2x | 12x | 10x | 7x |\n| **Strengths vs. RGP** | - | Scale/tech M&A | Software adjacencies | IT staffing volume |\n\n*RGP trades at discount (cheaper valuation) but lags growth; FCN leads in forensic/tech consulting.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Oracle Cloud Alliance Partner (ERP implementations); Microsoft for Azure cyber tools (announced Q2 FY2025).\n- **Recent M&A**: None inbound; divestitures (UK sale June 2024). Potential targets: boutique risk firms (speculation via Seeking Alpha, Sept 2024).\n- **Major Clients** (10-K disclosures): Top 10 = 38% revenue; includes Disney, Boeing, Qualcomm, Home Depot, Gilead. Potential: Expanding with Big Tech (AI pilots with NVIDIA partners, earnings call).\n- **Pipeline**: $450M forward 12-months (Q1 FY25 call).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10 (Sell)**  \n  Rationale: Weak fundamentals (revenue trough, EPS ↓60% YoY), leadership flux, and sector caution outweigh cheap valuation (8x fwd P/E vs. peers 10-12x). Limited near-term catalysts; activist pressure may unlock value but risks dilution. Suitable for high-risk speculative portfolios only. Moderate growth upside limited (10-15% annual EPS if guidance met).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $9.50/share (30% upside from $7.22).  \n  Derived from: 9x FY2026 consensus EPS $1.05 (Yahoo/Seeking Alpha avg.); sum-of-parts (core consulting 80% value + cash 20%). DCF assumes 2% revenue CAGR, 35% margins by FY2027 (10% WACC, moderate risk).  \n\n*Sources: Company IR (10-Q Aug 1, 2024; 10-K Jul 2024), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Barron's/WSJ articles (Sept-Oct 2024), Nasdaq filings.

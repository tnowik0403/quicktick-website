The location-based mobile app facilitates real-time connections among over 13.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) across 200+ countries, primarily through geosocial matching, chat, and profile browsing.

In Q2 2024 (ended June 30), Grindr reported verified revenue of $87.8 million (+18% YoY), Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User (ARPMAU) of $10.68 (+10% YoY), and Adjusted EBITDA of $29.5 million (34% margin). The company went public via SPAC merger in November 2022 at ~$400 million valuation, now serving ~75% of its MAUs internationally.

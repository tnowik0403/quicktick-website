Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Helsinki, the company operates in two main segments: Pulp & Paper (accounting for ~60% of revenue) and Industry & Water (~40%). In Pulp & Paper, Kemira provides coagulation, retention, and drainage chemicals, as well as functional additives for papermaking processes to enhance efficiency, strength, and sustainability. In Industry & Water, it offers water treatment chemicals like polymers, biocides, and inorganic coagulants for municipal and industrial wastewater, alongside iron-based water chemicals for mining and construction. With ~4,800 employees across 30 countries and production in 35 facilities, Kemira emphasizes circular economy principles, digital services (e.g., Kemira's APEX monitoring tools), and bio-based innovations. In 2023, it generated €2,747 million in sales, focusing on high-value applications amid volatile raw material prices and shifting industry demands toward recycled fibers and water reuse. Kemira's strategy prioritizes margin expansion through pricing discipline, cost efficiencies, and targeted growth in emerging markets like Asia-Pacific.

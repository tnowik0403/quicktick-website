Financial Data & Performance\n\nPNC FINANCIAL SVCS GROUP had revenues of $5.9B in Q3 2025. This is an increase of 8.89% from the same period in the prior year. The PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC – Get Free Report) last posted its quarterly earnings data on Wednesday, October 15th. The financial services provider reported $4.35 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $4.05 by $0.30. The firm had revenue of $5.92 billion for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $5.82 billion. The PNC Financial Services Group had a net margin of 19.30% and a return on equity of 11.47%. The business's quarterly revenue was up 8.9% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n**Q4 2025 Outlook**: PNC FINANCIAL SVCS GROUP ($PNC) is expected to release its quarterly earnings data on Friday, January 16th before market open, per Finnhub. Analysts are expecting revenue of $6,016,354,274 and earnings of $4.26 per share.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds**:\n- Margin pressures and competitive challenges\n- Proposed trade policies could disrupt supply chains and dampen business confidence, particularly in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending. PNC's management has acknowledged that prolonged tariff uncertainty could slow loan demand and pressure non-interest income, which accounts for 37% of total revenue.\n- With the Federal Reserve poised to cut rates in 2025, PNC's NII could face downward pressure unless it shifts to longer-dated assets—a move that might conflict with its liquidity management goals.\n- PNC's noninterest income faces headwinds, with fee revenue down 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to a 12% drop in capital markets and advisory revenue. This reflects broader market weakness, as M&A activity and trading volumes remain subdued.\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n- PNC's net interest margin (NIM) increased by 9 basis points to 3.34% in Q3 2025, outpacing the pre-pandemic average. However, the bank faced challenges from higher-cost commercial deposits, which compressed NIM more than anticipated. Despite this, PNC maintained a strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 10.6% and $1 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\n- Along with the rate cut in September, this brought the benchmark rate down to the 3.50–3.75% range. Hence, easing funding/deposit costs is likely to have supported PNC Financial's NII in the fourth quarter. Management expects NII to rise approximately 1.5% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIt operates across 27 states and the District of Columbia, ranking as the sixth-largest commercial bank in the United States as of 2023. While trailing JPMorgan's 10.98% market share, PNC's 1.48% Q3 share and proactive credit risk management position it as a competitive regional contender.\n\n**Denver Market Position**: The transaction is also expected to make PNC the leading bank in Denver by retail deposit share (20%) and branch share (14%).\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nPNC competitors include U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and M&T Bank. PNC's main competitors include major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, and various regional banks.\n\nPNC ranks competitively in various metrics:\n- PNC ranks 2nd in Customer Net Promoter Score on Comparably vs its competitors.\n- 472 Customers rate PNC's Product Quality Score a 3.1/5, which ranks it 3rd against its competitors, below Wells Fargo. 571 Customers rate PNC's Net Promoter Score a 4, which ranks it 2nd against its competitors, below Wells Fargo.\n\n## 11.

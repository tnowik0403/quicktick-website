The company owns and operates ~1,995 funeral service locations, 1,547 cemeteries, and 498 crematories across 49 states, 8 Canadian provinces, and Puerto Rico, serving ~600,000 families annually. SCI generates revenue primarily from at-need services (funerals, cremations upon death) and preneed sales (pre-planned contracts sold in advance, ~40% of revenue). Its integrated model spans funeral planning, embalming, cremation, burial, memorialization (markers, urns), and cemetery maintenance. SCI benefits from a fragmented industry with high barriers to entry due to real estate-intensive operations and regulatory approvals. With a trust-based preneed backlog exceeding $14B (as of Q2 2024), SCI emphasizes recurring revenue streams, operational efficiency via shared services, and demographic tailwinds from aging Baby Boomers. The company reported $4.22B in FY2023 revenue, focusing on market consolidation and digital enhancements for customer experience.

Decline risk if direct disposals grow >15% penetration.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (FY2023 or Latest) | SCI | Carriage Services (CSV) | Arbor Memorial (Private) |\n|---------------------------|-----|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Revenue** | $4.22B | $407M | ~$300M (est.) |\n| **Locations** | 1,995 funerals + 1,547 cemeteries | 200 funerals | 150+ Canada |\n| **Market Share (U.S.)** | 15-18% | ~2% | N/A |\n| **Preneed Backlog** | $14.4B | $1.1B | N/A |\n| **Margins (Adj. EBITDA)** | 32% | 28% | ~25% (est.) |\n| **Stock Perf. YTD** | +25% | +15% | N/A |\n\nSCI leads in scale, backlog, and efficiency; CSV more acquisitive but volatile.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: NFDA member; tech ties with Tribute Technology for online obits (renewed 2024).\n- **Recent M&A**:\n  | Date | Deal | Details |\n  |------|------|---------|\n  | Aug 2024 | 3 TX funeral homes | $15M tuck-in. |\n  | May 2024 | Midwest cemeteries | Added 200k sq ft sales potential. |\n  | Q1 2024 | 5 locations Canada | Bolsters preneed. |\n- Pipeline: 15-20 deals in negotiation (Q2 call).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Retail consumers (600k families/year); preneed from estates/insurance (e.g., MetLife, Prudential integrations).\n- **Potential**: Veteran's Affairs expansions; hospice chains (e.g., VITAS partnerships); corporate wellness programs for end-of-life planning.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Moat**: Real estate portfolio (1,900+ properties, $5B+ value); regulatory trusts protect backlog.\n- **ESG**: High cemetery endowments ($2B+); diversity initiatives (30% women in mgmt).\n- **Sentiment**: Analyst consensus \"Moderate Buy\" (avg PT $82, per MarketBeat Oct 2024); Reddit bullish on \"recession-proof.\"\n- **Risks**: Litigation (preneed lawsuits settled 2023); debt maturity 2026 ($1B).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Hold with Upside Bias**). Strong demographics/preneed offset near-term death normalization; valuation attractive at 11x EV/FCF vs. peers. Moderate risk from cyclical deaths/debt.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $92 (15% upside). DCF-based (8% growth 5yrs, 3% terminal, 9% WACC); targets strong growth portfolio amid Boomers aging. Hold below $75; buy dips.",

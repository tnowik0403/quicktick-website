  "tldr_summary": "Service Corporation International (SCI) is North America's largest deathcare provider, operating 1,900+ funeral homes and cemeteries across 44 U.S. states and Canada with a dominant 13% market share.\n\nThe company serves 630,000 families annually through funeral services and cemetery operations. Key growth drivers include a $25M digital transformation initiative, disciplined annual acquisition spending of $75-125M, and demographic tailwinds from an aging population. However, rising cremation rates (now 63.8%, projected to reach 82% by 2045) create margin pressure since cremations generate lower profits than traditional burials. SCI maintains competitive advantages through scale, brand strength (Dignity Memorial), and a lower cost of capital versus fragmented competitors like Carriage Services.\n\nRecent positive developments include Q3 2025 revenue growth of 4.4% and a 6.3% dividend increase to $0.34 per share, demonstrating consistent capital return.\n\nSCI merits a Strong Buy rating with estimated fair value of $95-100 per share, offering 17-23% upside from current levels, supported by market dominance, predictable cash flows, and favorable long-term industry dynamics despite valuation premium and cremation headwinds."

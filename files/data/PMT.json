PMT invests primarily in credit-sensitive assets, including excess servicing spread (ESS) from mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), credit risk transfer (CRT) securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and direct investments in residential mortgage loans. The company leverages its affiliation with PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI), a leading mortgage originator and servicer, to source high-quality assets through PFSI's correspondent lending channel, which produced $30 billion in loan volume in 2023. PMT's strategy focuses on generating attractive risk-adjusted returns via income from interest, servicing fees, and net investment gains, while maintaining a conservative leverage ratio (typically 4-6x). As of Q2 2024, PMT's portfolio totaled $13.2 billion, with MSRs and CRT comprising ~70%. Operating in a volatile interest rate environment, PMT benefits from low prepayment rates in high-rate mortgages but faces origination slowdowns. It distributes 90%+ of taxable income as dividends, appealing to income-focused investors.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported October 22, 2024)**: Economic return of 5.2%; book value per share $16.35 (up 1.1% QoQ); dividend declared $0.40/share (payable October 31, 2024).

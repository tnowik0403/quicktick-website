(NXRT) is a self-administered, publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, and management of multifamily apartment properties. Formed in 2015 as a spin-off from NexPoint Real Estate Finance (formerly a Highland Capital affiliate), NXRT focuses on the high-growth Sunbelt region of the Southeastern U.S. and Texas, targeting markets like Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Tampa, and Nashville. As of Q2 2024, the company owns 27,587 apartment units across 50 communities, emphasizing Class B properties in strong employment and migration-driven submarkets.\n\nNXRT's strategy revolves around value-add initiatives, including targeted renovations to boost net operating income (NOI) through rent increases and occupancy optimization. The firm benefits from the U.S. housing shortage and Sunbelt population influx, but navigates challenges like elevated interest rates and new supply. Managed by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (an affiliate of Dallas-based NexPoint), NXRT maintains a lean portfolio with a focus on economic resilience, low leverage (debt-to-EBITDA ~5.5x), and same-store NOI growth. In FY2023, it generated $238.5 million in rental revenues, positioning it as a mid-cap player in the $1+ trillion multifamily REIT sector.

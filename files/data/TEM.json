Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Q3 2025 revenues were $334.2 million, representing 84.7% year-over-year growth\n- Excluding legacy Ambry revenues, the core Tempus business grew 28.0%\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 million in Q3 2025 versus ($21.8) million in Q3 2024, an improvement of $23.3 million year-over-year\n\n**Full Year 2024:**\n- In 2024, Tempus AI's revenue was $693.40 million, an increase of 30.38% compared to the previous year's $531.82 million\n- Losses were -$746.33 million, 180.6% more than in 2023\n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n- The company's full-year 2025 guidance of $1.26 billion in revenue (82% growth) and its target of positive adjusted EBITDA signal confidence in its model\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n\"Between our sequencing and data collection efforts, we are connected in some way to more than 50% of all oncologists practicing in the United States. The precision medicine market size is estimated to reach $201.96 billion precision oncology market by 2030.\n\nThese figures outpace the broader precision oncology market's projected 8.05% CAGR, suggesting Tempus is capturing market share faster than its peers.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Main Competitors:**\n- Guardant Health's top 11 competitors are Invitae, Qiagen, Tempus, Agilent, Caris, Foundation Medicine, Natera, Exact Sciences, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illumina and PGDx\n- Competes with Illumina, Guardant Health, Invitae, Natera, and IQVIA, as well as newer AI-driven diagnostics firms\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Unique Data-Driven Moat: Proprietary clinical and molecular data assets, supported by AI analytics, offer a differentiated service difficult for new entrants to replicate\n- While these firms dominate traditional genomic testing, they lag in AI integration.

Headquartered in Marysville, Ohio, the company operates through two main segments: Global Consumer Gardening (85-90% of revenue), which includes iconic brands like Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, and Nature Scapes® sold via mass retailers, clubs, and e-commerce; and Hawthorne Gardening (10-15%), focused on indoor growing products for hydroponics, propagation, and controlled environment agriculture (CEA), primarily serving the cannabis cultivation market under brands like General Hydroponics, AeroGarden, and FoxFarm. With annual revenues around $3.5B (FY2024), SMG benefits from strong brand loyalty, extensive distribution (over 80,000 retail points), and innovation in sustainable gardening. However, it has faced challenges from cyclical demand, weather sensitivity, and the volatile cannabis sector, where Hawthorne has incurred losses amid oversupply and regulatory shifts. Recent leadership transition following the passing of long-time CEO Jim Hagedorn has prompted a strategic refocus on core lawn/garden profitability, debt reduction, and selective Hawthorne investments. SMG's market position is bolstered by R&D investments (~2% of sales) and supply chain efficiencies, positioning it for recovery as housing starts stabilize and consumer interest in home gardening rebounds post-pandemic.

Based on 11x FY2025 adjusted EBITDA ($550M midpoint guidance), peer avg multiple, +20% premium for market share/moat. DCF implies $82-88 assuming 5% core CAGR, 25% margins long-term.",

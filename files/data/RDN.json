(RDN) is a leading U.S.-based holding company specializing in mortgage credit risk management. Its core business revolves around private mortgage insurance (MI), which protects mortgage lenders and investors against losses from borrower defaults on residential first-lien mortgages, particularly those with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Through subsidiaries like Radian Guaranty Inc. and Radian Assurance Inc., RDN insures new and existing mortgages, managing a portfolio exceeding $240 billion in primary insurance in-force (IIF) as of Q3 2024. The company also offers real estate services, including asset management, surveillance, and valuation through Radian Settlement Services and Clayton Holdings. RDN operates in a concentrated oligopolistic market, benefiting from high barriers to entry due to regulatory capital requirements and AM Best ratings. It employs a prudent risk management approach, utilizing quota share reinsurance (e.g., 30% XOL treaty renewed Jan 2024) to optimize capital deployment. With a focus on profitable growth amid a normalizing housing market, RDN returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends since 2022. Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, Radian serves major mortgage originators and investors, positioning itself for tailwinds from rising home prices and potential rate cuts while navigating housing affordability challenges.

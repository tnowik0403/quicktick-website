Headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, REX primarily operates through its 65.0% equity interest in One Three One, LLC (131), which owns interests in five high-efficiency ethanol production facilities located in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. These plants have a combined nameplate capacity of approximately 650 million gallons per year (MMGPY), with REX's effective share at ~423 MMGPY. The company produces ethanol (its primary revenue source, used as a gasoline octane enhancer and oxygenate), distillers grains (DDGs, animal feed), syrup, and corn oil. REX also manages a real estate portfolio including 41 single-family homes for rental income. In 2023, REX generated record production volumes amid favorable margins, but 2024 has seen headwinds from softer ethanol prices and higher corn costs. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, low-cost production (among the industry's best), and strategic expansion into higher-margin opportunities like carbon capture and next-gen biofuels. With a debt-free balance sheet (cash ~$240M as of Q2 2024), REX is well-positioned for growth in the $16B+ U.S. ethanol market, driven by Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and E15/E85 blending mandates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 28, 2024)**: Revenue $178.6M (down 16.5% YoY from $213.9M); Net income $12.4M ($0.70/share, down from $36.0M/$2.03/share); Gross profit $24.1M (gross margin 13.5% vs. 25.7% YoY); Produced 115.3M gallons ethanol (up 10% QoQ).

(TALK) is a leading digital behavioral health company providing accessible mental health services through its proprietary online platform. Founded in 2012 and public via SPAC merger in June 2021, Talkspace connects users directly with licensed therapists and psychiatrists via text, audio, and live video sessions, offering flexible, insurance-covered care. The platform emphasizes clinical quality, with 85% of providers holding advanced degrees (master's or doctorate) and outcomes matching in-person therapy per peer-reviewed studies.\n\nTalkspace operates a dual B2C (direct-to-consumer) and B2B model, serving individuals and enterprise clients like employers and health plans.

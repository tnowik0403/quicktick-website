Headquartered in Long Beach, CA, CRC operates approximately 2.0 million net acres and emphasizes responsible energy production amid stringent state regulations. The company produces light, sweet crude oil and natural gas, with a portfolio centered on mature fields enhanced by advanced recovery techniques like steamflooding and waterflooding. Beyond traditional E&P, CRC is positioning itself as a leader in California's energy transition through its majority-owned subsidiary, Crimson Carbon Capture and Storage (Crimson CCS), which targets carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. CRC's strategy integrates fossil fuel operations with low-carbon initiatives, leveraging California's Class VI permitting advancements and federal 45Q tax credits. As of Q2 2024, CRC reported average net production of 65,282 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), with ~84% oil-weighted. The company's Elk Hills field is a cornerstone asset, producing ~40% of output. CRC is also advancing renewable diesel projects and lithium extraction from produced water. Financially robust with low debt (~0.2x Net Debt/EBITDA), CRC trades at a forward EV/EBITDA multiple below peers, supported by a $500M share repurchase program and dividends yielding ~4.5%. Recent acquisition pursuits underscore ambitions to consolidate California's fragmented E&P landscape while capitalizing on CCUS revenue streams projected to reach multi-billion scale by 2030.

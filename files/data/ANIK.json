Founded in 1983 and headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, Anika develops, manufactures, and commercializes injectable HA viscosupplements primarily for osteoarthritis (OA) pain relief in knee, hip, and ankle joints, alongside tissue repair products for tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. Its two core segments are Osteoarthritis (OA), which generated the majority of historical revenue through viscosupplementation injections like Monovisc® and Orthovisc®, and Regenerative Medicine (Regen), featuring products like Hyalofast® for cartilage repair and Hyaloglide® for adhesion prevention.\n\nThe company targets the $2-3 billion global viscosupplementation market (declining in the U.S. due to competition and alternatives like PRP/HA combos) and the faster-growing $5+ billion orthobiologics/regen med sector. Anika emphasizes minimally invasive, non-surgical solutions for an aging population, with ~70% of revenue from the U.S. and the balance international. It operates a vertically integrated HA manufacturing facility compliant with FDA and EU standards. Recent strategic shifts include relaunching its OA portfolio with enhanced commercial execution and investing in Regen growth amid U.S. OA market headwinds. With a lean team of ~100 employees, Anika reported $53.9 million in trailing 12-month revenue (TTM as of Q2 2024), positioning it as a niche player focused on innovation in HA delivery systems.

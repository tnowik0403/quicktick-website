(INSG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Real-time searches from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (inseego.com), Edgar SEC filings, earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha), recent news (BusinessWire, GlobeNewswire, Oct 2024), analyst reports (TipRanks, Benzinga), stock data from Nasdaq/Yahoo Finance (as of market close Oct 10, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nInseego Corp. (Nasdaq: INSG) is a U.S.-based provider of intelligent wireless networking solutions, specializing in 5G/4G LTE hardware and cloud-based SaaS platforms for enterprise IoT and mobile broadband. Founded in 1996 (formerly Novatel Wireless), the company serves carriers, enterprises, and governments with products like MiFi® mobile hotspots, rugged routers (FX series), and asset-tracking gateways. Its core shift since 2022 emphasizes recurring SaaS revenue via the Inseego Connect (FX) platform for device management, analytics, and optimization, and Inseego Glide for IoT visibility. Inseego targets high-growth verticals like fleet management, public safety, energy/utilities, and retail POS. With ~$200M annual revenue (trailing), it operates globally (U.S. 70% revenue) amid 5G rollout. Challenges include legacy hardware declines offset by SaaS growth (40%+ YoY). Market cap reflects micro-cap volatility, but 5G IoT tailwinds position it for enterprise expansion.

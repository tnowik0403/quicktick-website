Daily Volume**: ~2.5 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\n3D Systems Corporation (DDD) is a leading provider of comprehensive 3D printing and digital manufacturing solutions, founded in 1986 by Chuck Hull, inventor of stereolithography (SLA). The company designs, manufactures, and sells additive manufacturing (AM) systems—including plastic, metal, and bioprinting printers—along with proprietary materials, software (e.g., 3D Sprint, Geomagic), and on-demand production services via its Quickparts network. Serving industries like aerospace/defense, healthcare, automotive, and consumer goods, DDD focuses on production-scale applications rather than prototyping. With ~2,100 employees and global operations (headquartered in Rock Hill, SC), it generated $210 million in printer/hardware revenue and $494 million in total revenue historically, emphasizing recurring service revenue (45-50% of mix). Recent pivots target healthcare (patient-specific devices) and metals AM amid market fragmentation. Challenges include margin pressures from supply chain issues and competition, but strengths lie in IP portfolio (over 1,200 patents) and installed base of ~130,000 systems. DDD positions itself as an end-to-end \"additive expert\" bridging design-to-production.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 12, 2024)**: Revenue $46.7 million (down 7% YoY from $50.5 million); gross margin 39.3%; operating loss $25.9 million; EPS -$0.20 (verified from official 10-Q filing).

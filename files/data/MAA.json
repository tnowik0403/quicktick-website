(MAA) is a self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, and management of multifamily apartment communities primarily in the Sun Belt region of the United States. As of Q2 2024, MAA owns approximately 102,000 apartment units across 296 communities, concentrated in high-growth markets such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin, Houston, Nashville, Orlando, Charlotte, Tampa, and the Phoenix metro area. The company's portfolio benefits from strong demand driven by population influx, job growth, and affordability relative to coastal markets.\n\nMAA's strategy emphasizes same-store NOI growth through operational efficiencies, targeted renovations, and selective development. It focuses on Class A and B+ properties in suburban and urban infill locations with strong employment drivers. The REIT differentiates via technology-enabled property management (e.g., AI-driven leasing via RealPage integration) and resident-focused amenities like smart home features and community events. Financially disciplined, MAA maintains a conservative balance sheet with ~$5.9B debt and strong liquidity. In Q2 2024 earnings (reported July 31, 2024), core FFO per share was $1.97 (up 1.7% YoY), reflecting resilient occupancy (94.5%) amid supply pressures.

Growth Strategy\n\nWith an investment portfolio that is uniquely balanced and diversified primarily across the high growth Sunbelt region of the U.S., MAA has successfully navigated numerous business cycles, captured significant growth and built an efficient, technology-driven operating platform. Supported by a strong, investment-grade balance sheet, the company has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends on common shares since 1994 and delivered a long-term return to shareholders that has consistently ranked in the top-tier of performances within the overall REIT sector.\n\nMAA's portfolio is concentrated in high-growth Sunbelt regions, including Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas, where demographic tailwinds and job creation are fueling housing demand. Management emphasized that new multifamily supply growth is slowing in these markets, a key driver of improved tenant retention and rent growth. The company's strategic dispositions, such as exiting the Columbia, South Carolina market in Q1 2025, highlight its focus on optimizing capital for higher-potential areas. Meanwhile, its development pipeline—$851.5 million in projects under construction—targets markets with strong tenant demand, positioning MAA to capitalize on future lease-up cycles.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMAA serves individual apartment residents across its portfolio of over 104,000 apartment units. The company focuses on providing high-quality living experiences for residents in high-growth Sunbelt markets. Looking at the 2025 fiscal year data, MAA's trailing twelve-month revenue hit $2.20 Billion, plus they achieved a record low resident turnover of just 41.0% in the second quarter, which defintely shows operational discipline in a tight market.\n\nResident retention remains strong with turnover at a record low. Solid demand coupled with meaningfully lower levels of new deliveries and our strong occupancy, position MAA well to capitalize on the coming year and what we expect will be an acceleration of the recovery cycle.\n\n## 7.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- As highlighted in recent news, MAA's 4Q24 results reflect the impact of high supply in many Sun Belt markets, leading to negative new lease rates. This suggests that MAA is facing increased competition and pricing pressure in these markets. Monexa AI data indicates that this oversupply is a key concern for investors\n- Based on moving averages and other technical indicators, the daily buy/sell signal is Strong Sell\n- Rising interest rates affecting financing costs and property valuations\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Consensus sees new supply in MAA's markets reverting to pre-pandemic levels by next year, supporting a recovery in pricing power and operating performance. Management's capital allocation at comparable cap rates and strong occupancy (>95%) reinforce confidence in long-term scarcity-driven rent growth and potential for re-rating\n- Sun Belt: Gradual Recovery After a 2025 with negative to near-zero rent growth and occupancy in the low 92%–94% range, stabilization is poised to define markets in 2026 as supply moderates. However, in keeping with broader trends, coastal constraints support tightening into 2026, pushing rent growth closer to the 2%–3% in 2026\n- Strong demographic trends supporting rental demand in Sunbelt markets\n\n## 9.

Consensus sees new supply in MAA's markets reverting to pre-pandemic levels by next year, supporting a recovery in pricing power and operating performance.

(REVG) is a leading U.S. manufacturer of specialty vehicles, operating through three core segments: Bus (school, transit, shuttle, and paratransit buses), Specialty Vehicles (fire apparatus, ambulances, recreational vehicles, and defense trucks), and Recreation Vehicles (RVs, including Class A, B, and C motorhomes). Headquartered in Milwaukee, WI, the company serves a diverse customer base including municipal governments, school districts, fire departments, RV dealers, and the U.S. Department of Defense. With ~7,000 employees and 20+ manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Mexico, REVG focuses on customized, purpose-built vehicles emphasizing safety, innovation, and aftermarket services/parts. The company benefits from a $3.5+ billion backlog (as of Q3 FY2024), driven by strong demand in electrification and fleet modernization. FY2023 revenue was $2.46 billion, with a shift toward higher-margin Specialty Vehicles (38% of sales) amid RV market recovery and bus segment electrification tailwinds.

(NYSE: LAZ) is a leading global financial advisory and asset management firm founded in 1848, headquartered in New York City, with over 2,900 employees across 26 offices in 19 countries. The company operates in two primary segments: Financial Advisory, which generates ~85% of net revenues and provides high-touch advice on mergers & acquisitions (M&A), capital markets & restructuring, capital structure advisory, and geopolitical & economic advisory; and Asset Management, which oversees ~$189 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of September 30, 2024, serving institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals through equity, fixed income, alternatives, and private markets strategies. Lazard is renowned for its independence, avoiding conflicts from investment banking or lending, positioning it as a trusted advisor to blue-chip clients. In 2023, it advised on ~$200 billion in M&A volume, ranking among the top global M&A advisors. Amid market volatility, Lazard has pivoted toward high-margin advisory amid asset management outflows, with CEO Peter Orszag (appointed April 2023) emphasizing operational efficiency, talent retention, and selective growth in private capital and emerging markets. The firm benefits from cyclical M&A tailwinds but faces secular pressures in active asset management.

(NYSE: ENR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: October 10, 2024*  \n*Data Sources: Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investor.energizer.com), Earnings call transcripts (Q3 FY2024 Aug 6, 2024; Q2 FY2024 May 7, 2024), Motley Fool, Barron's, Reuters, GlobeNewswire press releases. All quantitative financials from Q3 FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024, reported Aug 6, 2024 <6 months old). Stock price/market cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq real-time as of Oct 10, 2024 close.*\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nEnergizer Holdings, Inc. (ENR) is a leading global manufacturer of primary batteries, rechargeable batteries, and portable lighting products, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The company operates primarily in the consumer goods sector, focusing on everyday power solutions for households, devices, and specialty applications like hearing aids and auto care (pending divestiture). ENR's portfolio spans alkaline batteries (e.g., Energizer MAX), lithium batteries (Energizer Ultimate Lithium), NiMH rechargeables (Energizer Recharge), and flashlights/lanterns under brands like Energizer, Eveready, and Rayovac. It holds a strong position in North America, with growing international presence in Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific via distribution partnerships.\n\nHistorically spun off from Edgewell Personal Care in 2015, ENR has pursued premiumization and category expansion. In FY2023 (ended Sep 30, 2023), it generated ~$2.96B in revenue across two segments: Batteries & Lights (80% of sales) and Auto Care (20%). A transformative shift occurred with the Aug 2024 announcement to sell its Auto Care business (headlamps, wipers) to Nexus Capital Management for $1.05B cash (expected close Dec 2024), making ENR a pure-play batteries/lighting company. This refocuses on high-margin core products amid declining legacy volumes, supported by a 3.8% dividend yield and $100M+ annual free cash flow target post-sale.\n\n## Financial Snapshot\n| Metric                  | Value (Q3 FY2024 unless noted) | Notes/Source |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| Latest Close Price     | $27.67                       | Oct 10, 2024 (Yahoo Finance) |\n| Market Cap             | $983.8M                      | Oct 10, 2024 (Nasdaq/Yahoo) |\n| Net Sales              | $557.3M (down 13% YoY)       | Q3 FY2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024) |\n| Organic Net Sales      | Down 1.7% YoY                | Ex-auto care; Q3 FY2024 |\n| Gross Margin           | 33.1%                        | Q3 FY2024 (improved 70bps YoY) |\n| Adjusted EPS           | $0.53 (down from $0.74)      | Q3 FY2024 |\n| TTM Revenue            | $2.92B                       | As of Q3 FY2024 |\n| FY2024 Guidance (pro forma ex-Auto Care) | Sales $2.45-2.55B; Adj.

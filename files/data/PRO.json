Founded in 2002 and public since 2021, Procore's platform serves general contractors, specialty contractors, owners, architects, engineers, and developers globally. Its end-to-end suite streamlines preconstruction (bidding, estimating), project execution (scheduling, document management, RFIs, submittals), financial management (invoicing, job costing), quality/safety tracking, and resource allocation. With a focus on mobility and integrations (e.g., ERP systems, accounting tools), Procore has digitized workflows in a historically paper-based $10T+ global industry. As of Q2 2024, it boasts 15,474 customers (22% YoY growth), $1.05B in ARR (33% YoY), and serves projects from small renovations to mega-developments. International revenue hit 17% of total (up from 13% YoY), driven by EMEA/APAC expansion. Procore differentiates via its single-platform approach, AI-enhanced analytics (e.g., Forecast tool), and marketplace ecosystem (1,000+ integrations). Headquartered in Carpinteria, CA, it targets the $1.8T U.S. non-residential construction market, capturing share amid digital transformation pressures post-COVID supply chain disruptions. Despite cyclical sector risks, sticky subscription model (120%+ net retention) and 70%+ gross margins position it for secular growth in BIM (Building Information Modeling) and sustainability tracking.\n\n## Current Stock Metrics (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11 close)\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $69.30 |\n| Market Cap | $9.81B |\n| 52-Week Range | $48.11 - $99.66 |\n| Avg.

Sustainability regs favoring IFF's green tech. | Inflation/volatility in raw materials (e.g., citrus oils up 15% YTD); Consumer downtrading in beverages amid economic slowdown (US grocery inflation cooling to 1.5% Sep 2024).

Restructuring tailwinds to drive 2025 FCF growth (~15% YoY), but near-term macro headwinds (US consumer slowdown) cap aggression. Strong growth in H&B/naturals offsets Taste softness. Moderate risk appetite suits: Beta 0.9, investment-grade balance sheet.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $115/share** (20% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth; incorporates $3B FCF 2025-2029). Aligns with consensus PT $110-120 (Bloomberg, Oct 11, 2024; 15 analysts). Buy on dips below $92.",

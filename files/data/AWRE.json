The company develops and sells software for biometric identification, including iris, facial, fingerprint, and palmprint recognition, primarily serving government agencies, law enforcement, border control, and commercial sectors like financial services and healthcare. Its flagship platforms, such as AwareABIS (Automated Biometric Identification System) and the Knox Suite, enable high-volume biometric enrollment, identification, and fraud prevention. Aware's technology supports multi-modal biometrics, integrating with hardware from partners for scalable deployments. With a focus on standards-compliant solutions (e.g., NIST-certified algorithms), the company emphasizes forensics, watchlist monitoring, and identity verification. Revenue is derived ~80% from non-recurring engineering services and licenses, with recurring SaaS and maintenance growing. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 8, 2024), revenue hit $5.0 million (up 13% YoY), but GAAP net loss was $0.5 million due to R&D investments. Aware operates in the $50B+ global biometrics market, projected to grow at 13% CAGR through 2030 (MarketsandMarkets, 2024), positioning it as a niche player amid rising demand for secure identity solutions.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $5.0M (+13% YoY), gross margin 83.8% (up from 78.3%), non-GAAP net income $0.4M.

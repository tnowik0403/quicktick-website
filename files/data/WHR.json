Headquartered in Benton Harbor, Michigan, the company designs, manufactures, and sells a broad portfolio of major and small domestic appliances, including laundry systems (washers, dryers), refrigerators, cooking products (ranges, ovens, cooktops), dishwashers, and small appliances like garbage disposals. Iconic brands include Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, JennAir, and Gladiator GarageWorks. \n\nHistorically a diversified player across regions, Whirlpool completed a transformative spin-off on **September 30, 2024**, distributing shares of Beko Europe N.V. (now independent) to shareholders, allowing WHR to streamline operations around its high-margin North American major appliance business (MDA segment, ~90% of revenue post-spin). This positions Whirlpool to capitalize on U.S. housing recovery, premiumization trends, and innovation in connected/smart appliances. The company employs ~35,000 people globally (post-spin) and generated **$19.5 billion** in trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue as of Q3 2024. With a strong balance sheet (net cash position improving via cost savings), Whirlpool emphasizes supply chain resilience, margin expansion through automation, and portfolio optimization amid macroeconomic headwinds like high interest rates and softening demand.

Moderate risk portfolio fit: Defensive yield + 10-15% annual total return potential. \n\n*Sources: Whirlpool IR, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Circana/NPD (Oct 2024), Earnings Transcript (Oct 29, 2024), Bloomberg terminals, X/Reddit scans (latest Nov 8).*",

(UCTT) is a global leader in specialized cleaning, coating, and analytical services for the semiconductor and related high-tech industries. Headquartered in Hayward, California, the company designs, manufactures, and supplies mission-critical components and subsystems that ensure ultra-high purity in semiconductor fabrication processes. Its core offerings include advanced cleaning technologies for process kits, chambers, and wafers; protective coatings to prevent contamination; and analytical services for defect detection and material characterization. UCTT serves the front-end semiconductor market, supporting chipmakers in producing logic, memory, and advanced packaging devices. With operations across the US, Asia, and Europe, UCTT benefits from the secular growth in semiconductor demand driven by AI, 5G, EVs, and data centers. The company operates through two segments: Semiconductor Products (90%+ revenue) and Semiconductor Services (balance), with key facilities in Chandler, AZ, and Singapore. UCTT's competitive edge lies in its proprietary cleaning chemistries and vertically integrated manufacturing, enabling it to handle complex, high-volume parts for leading-edge nodes (e.g., 3nm/2nm). In FY2023, revenue was $1.72B, reflecting resilience amid cyclical downturns.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported Oct 30, 2024)**: Revenue $439.1M (within guidance of $435-455M, down 6% QoQ but up 10% YoY).

Daily Volume: 268,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nHEICO Corporation is a premier provider of high-performance aftermarket replacement parts, subassemblies, and specialized components primarily for the aviation, defense, space, industrial, and medical sectors. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Hollywood, Florida, HEICO operates through two main segments: the Flight Support Group (FSG), which accounts for ~71% of net sales and focuses on FAA-approved replacement parts (including PMA and OEM alternatives) for commercial, regional, business, and military aircraft; and the Electronic Systems Group (ESG), representing ~29% of sales, which designs and manufactures electronic components for defense platforms (e.g., missiles, radar), space applications (e.g., satellites), and industrial/medical equipment.  \n\nHEICO's competitive edge lies in its niche market dominance, often holding \"monopoly-like\" positions in high-margin aftermarket parts where OEMs charge premiums. The company emphasizes organic growth through R&D-driven PMA certifications (cheaper, reliable alternatives to OEM parts) and a disciplined M&A strategy targeting bolt-on acquisitions in adjacent niches. With a fleet of ~13,000 active PMA/STC parts and serving over 1,000 customers globally, HEICO benefits from secular tailwinds like aging commercial fleets, rising defense budgets, and space commercialization. In FY2024 (ended Oct 29, 2024), HEICO achieved record net sales of $3.56 billion (up 22% YoY), driven by FSG's aftermarket demand and ESG's defense contracts. Gross margins averaged ~40%, reflecting pricing power and operational efficiency. HEICO's \"buy-and-build\" model has delivered ~15% CAGR in EPS over the past decade, positioning it as a resilient compounder in aerospace/defense.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported Feb 13, 2025, for period ended Jan 31, 2025)**: Net sales $956.7M (+27% YoY); Operating income $259.4M (+42% YoY); Diluted EPS $0.99 (+46% YoY).

Online buzz (StockTwits/Reddit): Bullish on M&A pipeline amid defense spend.\n- **Risks**: 45% debt/EBITDA post-Wencor (manageable); Cyclicality tied to air travel (IATA forecasts +4.5% RPK 2025).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 9/10 (Strong Buy)**: Exceptional growth (15%+ CAGR potential), margin durability, and M&A firepower outweigh moderate valuation premium. Ideal for growth portfolios; hold through cycles.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $265** (16% upside from $228.47). Based on 28x FY2026 EPS ($9.50 est., 15% growth), DCF (12% IRR, 3% terminal), peer avg (11x sales). Moderate risk via diversified segments (commercial 60%, defense 40%).",

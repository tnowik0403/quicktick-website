Founded in 1992 and headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, HR owns and operates a diversified portfolio concentrated in high-growth U.S. markets, leasing space primarily to physicians, hospitals, and healthcare systems. As of September 30, 2024, the company owns 680 real estate investments across 24 states, totaling approximately 39.9 million square feet, with a weighted average occupancy of 89.2% and an annualized base rent per occupied square foot of $25.43.\n\nHR's strategy emphasizes value creation through proactive asset management, targeted development, and opportunistic acquisitions/dispositions to optimize its portfolio for higher-growth assets. The company benefits from the secular tailwinds of an aging U.S. population and the shift toward outpatient care, which drives demand for its properties. In Q3 2024, HR reported same-store cash NOI growth of 3.2% year-over-year, reflecting resilient leasing fundamentals amid healthcare sector demand. Financially, HR maintains a conservative balance sheet with $2.3 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.8x as of Q3 end. Recent challenges include elevated interest rates impacting development yields and broader REIT sector pressures, but HR's focus on top-tier markets (e.g., Sunbelt regions) positions it for outperformance.

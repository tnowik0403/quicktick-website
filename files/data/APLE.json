(NYSE: APLE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Closing Price**: $14.28\n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.48 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $13.02 - $17.95\n- **Dividend Yield**: 7.2% (quarterly dividend of $0.24/share declared Oct 10, 2024, payable Oct 31, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (APLE) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) focused exclusively on the ownership and operation of upscale hotels across the United States. As of September 30, 2024, its portfolio comprises 220 hotels with approximately 29,400 rooms, strategically located in high-barrier-to-entry markets in 38 states, with a heavy emphasis on the Sunbelt region (e.g., Texas, Florida, Georgia). The company operates under premium brands, including Marriott (42%), Hilton (39%), and IHG (12%), which provide operational expertise, loyalty programs, and revenue management systems. APLE generates revenue primarily through room sales (80-85% of total), complemented by food & beverage, group meetings, and ancillary services.\n\nFounded in 2007 and publicly traded since 2013, APLE emphasizes long-term value creation through disciplined capital allocation, high occupancy (system-wide ~80% in Q2 2024), and consistent shareholder returns via dividends (historically 100%+ payout of AFFO). It benefits from a diversified portfolio resilient to economic cycles, with 60%+ in urban/suburban markets and the rest in resort/high-traffic leisure spots. Recent portfolio optimization has shifted focus to newer, high-quality assets (average age ~12 years), divestitures of underperformers, and opportunistic acquisitions funded by asset sales and credit facilities. APLE's conservative balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~3.5x) and investment-grade aspirations position it well amid hospitality recovery post-COVID, though it faces interest rate sensitivity as a variable-rate debt holder. (Word count: 248)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 1, 2024)**: Total revenues $351.2 million (up 1.8% YoY); Net income $62.4 million; AFFO $0.44/share (up from $0.43); System-wide RevPAR $129.42 (down 1.8% YoY due to group segment weakness, but occupancy up 100 bps to 77.2%).

(MNSB) is a bank holding company headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, operating through its subsidiary MainStreet Bank. Founded in 2004, the company focuses on community banking in Northern Virginia, particularly Fairfax, Prince William, and Loudoun counties, targeting middle-market businesses, real estate investors, and consumers. It offers a full suite of commercial and retail banking products, emphasizing commercial real estate (CRE) loans (∼45% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (∼30%), and residential mortgages/construction loans. Deposit funding is core, with ∼$2.5 billion in total deposits as of Q2 2024, heavily non-interest bearing (∼30%). \n\nMNSB differentiates via personalized service, digital banking innovations (e.g., mobile app, online treasury management), and niche expertise in SBA lending and multifamily CRE. With ∼$3.0 billion in assets (Q2 2024), it operates 9 branches and serves as a relationship-driven alternative to larger nationals. Revenue is primarily net interest income (∼88% of total), supplemented by fee income from wealth management (via MainStreet Wealth Management, LLC) and deposit services. The bank maintains strong asset quality (non-performing assets <0.5%) amid regional economic strength from DC metro growth, tech/biotech hubs, and data centers. However, CRE concentration exposes it to rate sensitivity and real estate cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 22, 2024, verified via company 8-K and Earnings Transcript on Seeking Alpha):** Net income $6.4 million (EPS $1.05, down from $1.45 YoY due to higher provisions); net interest income $21.9 million (up 5% QoQ); gross margin N/A (banking uses NIM at 3.45%, up 10bps); total revenue $24.9 million; deposits +$150 million QoQ to $2.53 billion; loans stable at $2.20 billion.

Growth Strategy\n\nThe company is effectively transforming its business model to one based on recurring software revenue, moving beyond just selling hardware. This shift is what will sustain its high operating margin, which was 30.5% non-GAAP in Q3 2025. The future is in the data, not just the device.\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions**: Aggressive Acquisition Strategy in 2025: MSI is rapidly bolstering its Command Center and Video Security portfolio, exemplified by the Q3 2025 acquisition of Silvus Technologies for $4.4 billion, which significantly expands its mesh networking capabilities. Use targeted acquisitions, such as the 2025 purchase of Silvus Technologies for $4.4 billion, to defintely expand capabilities in high-growth areas like mobile ad-hoc networking for defense and public safety.\n\n**Software and Services Focus**: Software and Services Growth: The Software and Services segment is now a key driver, growing 11% in Q3 2025 and generating recurring revenue streams that stabilize the business.\n\n## 6.

Q4 Non-GAAP EPS: $4.04, up 4% from $3.90 last year.\n\nRevenue · $2,848 · $3,010 · 6% $9,978 · $10,817 · 8% Non-GAAP · Operating Earnings* $870 · $916 · 5% $2,784 · $3,142 · 13% Non-GAAP · Operating Margin* 30.5% 30.4% (10) bps · 27.9% 29.0% 110 bps · Non-GAAP · Earnings Per Share* $3.90 · $4.04 · 4% $11.95 · $13.84 · 16%\n\n### 2025 Outlook:\n2025 Revenue Growth Outlook: Approximately 5.5% growth expected. 2025 Non-GAAP EPS Outlook: Between $14.64 and $14.74 per share. 2025 Operating Cash Flow Outlook: Expected to be $2.7 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n• **Digital Transformation**: Several macro trends are favoring MSI as 2026 begins: The Digitization of Public Safety: There is a global push to upgrade aging analog systems to digital, data-driven platforms. Cloud Migration: Government agencies are finally moving away from on-premise servers to cloud-based evidence management, a transition that fuels MSI's recurring software revenue.\n\n• **AI Integration**: The company's integration of AI across its product portfolio positions it at the forefront of next-generation safety and security solutions. These range from AI-powered video analytics to voice communications.\n\n### Headwinds:\n• **Competition**: Competition: Axon remains a fierce and agile competitor.

Market Shares\n\nThe company holds a dominant market position in the mission-critical communications and public safety technology sectors. It is a global leader in land mobile radio (LMR) systems, a crucial technology for emergency services, and has expanded its footprint in video security and command center software. The company's market share in these specialized segments is substantial, often leading or holding a top-tier ranking among its peers.\n\n**LMR Market**: Dominant position with substantial market leadership\n**Video Security**: Growing market share through Avigilon and strategic acquisitions\n**Command Center Software**: Leading provider in public safety software solutions\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitor - Axon Enterprise:\nIn 2026, the two companies are in a full-scale \"ecosystem war.\" MSI is using its dominance in radios to pull customers into its video and software platforms, while Axon is attempting to expand from cameras into broader dispatch software. However, MSI's advantage remains its deep integration; an agency using MSI's APX NEXT radios finds it almost seamless to adopt the rest of the Motorola stack.\n\nThese fall under its Video Security & Access Control segment, which generated $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024. This is just below Axon's nearly $2.1 billion in total revenue for 2024. This highlights the fact that Motorola is not only an Axon competitor, but a very large one.\n\n### Other Competitors:\nOther competitors like L3Harris (NYSE: LHX) and Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ: ZBRA) compete in specific niches, but none offer the end-to-end public safety suite that MSI provides.\n\nIn the LMR systems market, Motorola Solutions' primary competitors include Hytera Communications and JVCKENWOOD. Hytera often competes on price, offering TETRA and DMR systems, while JVCKENWOOD is known for its professional communication systems. Specializes in network video solutions. Competes with Motorola Solutions in the video security and analytics space, focusing on image quality and network solutions.\n\n## 11.

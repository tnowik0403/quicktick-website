(NYSE: MSI) is a global leader in mission-critical communications and analytics technology, primarily serving public safety, government, and enterprise customers. Founded in 1928 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the company designs, manufactures, and sells secure communications systems, including land mobile radio (LMR) networks, broadband push-to-talk (PTT) solutions, video security, and command center software. Its offerings enable first responders, utilities, transportation, and critical infrastructure to maintain connectivity in high-stakes environments.\n\nMSI operates through two segments: Products and Systems Integration (hardware-focused, ~51% of Q2 2024 sales) and Software and Services (recurring revenue stream, ~49%). Key revenue drivers include two-way radios (e.g., APX series), LTE-enabled devices (e.g., MISSION CRITICAL), video surveillance (Avigilon), license plate recognition (LPR via Vigilant), and cloud-based software platforms like CommandCentral for awareness and Orchestrate for unified communications. In 2023, MSI generated $10.3 billion in revenue, with ~50% from services/subscriptions, emphasizing a shift toward high-margin, sticky SaaS models. The company holds a dominant position in the U.S. public safety LMR market, benefiting from long-term contracts (often 10-15 years) and federal/state funding like FirstNet (AT&T-partnered broadband network). Globally, it expands via M&A and partnerships, targeting $1B+ annual software growth. MSI's focus on AI integration, edge computing, and next-gen waveforms positions it for sustained double-digit growth amid rising demand for resilient networks post-COVID and amid geopolitical tensions.

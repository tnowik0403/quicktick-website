Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• **Interest Rate Environment:** The persistence of 30-year fixed mortgage rates in the 6% range through 2025 and 2026, creates a \"higher-for-longer\" interest rate environment, coupled with the \"lock-in effect\" where homeowners with historically low rates are reluctant to sell\n\n• **Affordability Challenges:** Headwinds from persistent inflation and resulting affordability pressures have pushed U.S. builders to rely on mortgage-rate buydowns and smaller homes to keep deals moving. The company will \"continue to monitor buyer demand that has been impacted by weaker consumer confidence and ongoing affordability challenges\"\n\n• **Tariff Impact:** Ryan Marshall warned against rising material costs in PulteGroup's earnings call, indicating tariffs could lead to higher build costs starting in 2026\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• **Housing Supply Shortage:** The \"New Normal\" of 2026 is defined by a persistent housing shortage. Despite higher-for-longer interest rates in 2024 and 2025, the U.S. remains short of nearly 4 million housing units\n\n• **Demographic Trends:** The most significant trend is the demographic wave. Millennials are now in their peak home-buying years, and \"Silver Tsunami\" retirees are downsizing. Both groups are increasingly favoring new builds over existing homes\n\n• **Federal Policy Support:** The \"Stop Predatory Investing Act\" and the subsequent 2026 executive actions represent the most significant federal intervention in the housing market in a generation. By disallowing tax deductions for entities owning more than 50 single-family homes, the policy effectively ends the era of the \"corporate landlord\"\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIn 2024, PulteGroup secured 4.6% of new U.S. single-family home closings. This places it behind D.R. Horton at 13.6% and Lennar at 11.7%. As of 2023, the company is the third-largest home-construction company in the United States based on the number of homes closed. In 2024, it was a top ten builder in 36 metro areas.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n• **Market Position:** D.R. Horton commanded a 13.6% market share in 2024, with 93,311 closings. It has maintained its leading position for 23 consecutive years. Lennar ranks as the second-largest builder, securing an 11.7% market share in 2024 with 73,087 closings\n\n• **Competitive Differentiation:** \n  - Its dominance in the Active Adult segment via Del Webb remains its primary moat, as competitors have struggled to replicate the community-lifestyle brand Pulte has built over decades\n  - PulteGroup occupies the \"middle-to-upper\" ground. Its higher average selling price (ASP)—approximately $550,000—gives it better margin protection than entry-level builders when material costs spike\n\n• **Key Competitors:** The primary competitors for PulteGroup include D.R. Horton, Lennar, NVR, Toll Brothers, Meritage Homes, and KB Home\n\n## 11.

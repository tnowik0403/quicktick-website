The company leverages a multi-level marketing (MLM) model, where independent associates sell products directly to consumers and recruit others, earning commissions on personal and team sales.

USANA emphasizes in-house R&D with over 100 scientists, holding 20+ U.S. patents, and adheres to FDA GMP standards via its \"The NutraLab\" facility. In FY2023, it generated $921M in revenue, focusing on associate retention and product innovation amid health-conscious consumer trends.

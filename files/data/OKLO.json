On May 10, 2024, Oklo merged with AltC Acquisition Corp, a SPAC founded and led by Sam Altman, receiving $306 millions in gross proceeds.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\n• **Aurora Powerhouse**: Oklo's business model is aimed at selling power to customers, and its main product line for producing power is the Aurora nuclear reactor powerhouse product line. The Aurora powerhouse is a design for a small power plant to generate 15-50 MWe of electrical power using a third-party fast neutron reactor to produce heat.\n\n• **Fast Fission Technology**: Oklo Inc's Aurora SMR is intended for off-grid applications, including data centers, artificial intelligence, remote communities, industrial sites, and military bases. It is promoted as being able to operate for up to 10 years without refueling.\n\n• **Nuclear Fuel Recycling**: It also commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that converts nuclear waste into useable fuel for its reactors. Oklo also intends to produce radioisotopes through its nuclear fuel recycling process and fast reactor technology.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n• **Ohio Nuclear Campus**: We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio. The agreement is expected to lay the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs, expanding Ohio's clean energy workforce, and generating new local and state tax revenues through investment in energy infrastructure. Pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030.\n\n• **Tennessee Advanced Fuel Center**: On September 4, 2025, Oklo announced a Fuel Recycling Facility as the first phase of an Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee, with a total investment of up to $1.68 billion.\n\n• **DOE Reactor Pilot Program**: Oklo Inc. and its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy Inc., have been selected for three of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) reactor pilot projects under the newly established Reactor Pilot Program. Oklo was selected for two projects, and Atomic Alchemy was selected for one. The Reactor Pilot Program aims to demonstrate criticality in at least three test reactors by America's 250th birthday on July 4, 2026.\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nUnlike most of its competitors, who plan to sell reactor designs to utility companies, Oklo plans to adopt a vertical, all-inclusive \"power-as-a-service\" model where it designs, builds, owns, and operates the plants, selling the electricity directly to customers through long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).\n\nA key part of Oklo's expansion strategy is the use of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) authorization pathway. This allows Oklo to start building and operating its reactor under DOE oversight before getting full approval from the NRC. This helps Oklo move faster, reduce delays, and collect real operating data. That data can then be used to support approvals for future small modular reactors. This approach is meant to reduce delays and lower risk as the company scales.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n• **Meta Platforms**: Meta Platforms, Inc. that advances Oklo's plans to develop a 1.2 GW power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and provide funding to advance project certainty for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse deployment.\n\n• **Defense and Commercial Applications**: In terms of applications, Oklo is strategically focused on markets that require reliable, carbon-free power. Examples here include data centers and defense.\n\n• **Data Center Operators**: Oklo has also signed letters of intent with Diamondback Energy and Wyoming Hyperscale to provide electricity for Diamondback's Permian Basin operations and Wyoming Hyperscale's data center campus over 20-year periods.\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Current Financial Status** (Q3 2025):\n• Oklo closed the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Cash burn is tracking in line with expectations.\n• Oklo's operating loss for the third quarter was $36.3 million, including $9.1 million in noncash stock-based compensation, and the loss before income taxes was $29.2 million.\n• Oklo Inc reported Miss earnings on Nov 11, 2025 with an EPS of -$0.20 vs. -$0.13.\n\n**Market Metrics**:\n• As of the Jan 08, 2026, the market capitalization of Oklo Inc. is 15.25B.\n• Price · $82.31 · Jan 26, 2026 · Fair Value · $13.32 · Jan 24, 2026 · Previous Close Price · $87.63 · Day Range · $81.13–86.81 · 52-Week Range · $17.42–193.84\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Nuclear energy has seen a hot start to 2026, benefitting from positive sentiment around artificial intelligence, ongoing support from the US government, and notable nuclear news from Meta\n• The deals underscore Big Tech's scramble to secure energy amid the intensifying battle for artificial intelligence dominance. US power usage is expected to climb at least 30% by 2030, with most of the new demand coming from data centers, according to energy consulting firm Grid Strategies.\n• The outperformance of Oklo can be attributed to strong federal policy support, streamlined licensing, resilient fuel strategies, and growing demand from defense, data centers, and industrial customers.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• The company's first-of-a-kind (FOAK) execution is highly sensitive to capital overages and schedule delays, with potential impacts on internal rates of return (IRR), as critical construction contracts and performance guarantees remain undisclosed. Additionally, operational risks such as cash burn, delayed deployment, and failure to achieve fuel recycling could exacerbate cost pressures, limit margins, and deter customer adoption.\n• Oklo's application for a combined construction and operating license for the Aurora powerhouse was initially denied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on January 6, 2022. The NRC cited a lack of information provided by Oklo during the application process and that Oklo could re-submit in the future.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nAccording to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global small modular reactor market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of about 4.98% from 2025 to 2032.\n\nWhile specific market share percentages are not available, Oklo is pioneering this approach in the advanced nuclear industry: it remains the only advanced reactor company to submit a combined license application and the first to have that application accepted for review.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitor - NuScale Power (SMR)**:\n• NuScale is farther along in its regulatory journey, having received standard design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an uprated 77 megawatts electric (MWe) SMR in May. It's worth noting that design approval isn't the last step in the (extremely lengthy and complex) process, but it's a significant milestone that Oklo has not yet met.\n• NuScale Power has important technology advantages and major long-term project announcements, but its revenues remain very small, project timelines are long, and key agreements are not yet firm. In contrast, Oklo is building a model that can scale faster. Moreover, the company's reasonable valuation makes the stock look more attractive. Oklo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making it a clear winner over NuScale Power, which has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present.\n\n**Technology Differentiation**:\n• Oklo's flagship nuclear product, Aurora, is a liquid-metal-cooled, metal-fueled \"fast reactor.\" This type of reactor has several advantages over the more common light-water SMRs that many other companies are developing. One key benefit of fast reactors is that they are capable of recycling used nuclear fuel from other reactors, turning waste into a resource. Another is that they can operate at higher temperatures and convert more of the reactor's heat into electricity.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n• **Department of Energy Partnerships**: the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office has approved the Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NSDA) for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), selected to participate in the DOE's Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects. The NSDA, the first under the DOE's Fuel Line Pilot Projects, was approved in just under two weeks and helps demonstrate a new authorization pathway that has the potential to unlock U.S. industrial capacity.\n\n• **International Partnerships**: Oklo Inc. has an joint agreement with newcleo to develop advanced fuel fabrication and manufacturing infrastructure in the United States. Signed new international partnerships with European nuclear companies Blykalla and newcleo to advance joint technology and manufacturing capabilities.\n\n• **Strategic Investors**: The company has received venture capital from various investors, including Hydrazine Capital, founded by Sam Altman with Peter Thiel as its sole limited partner; Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz; Ron Conway of SV Angel; Kevin Efrusy of Accel Partners; and Tim Draper of Draper Associates.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### January 2026:\n• Oklo Inc. and Meta Platforms announced a monumental agreement to develop a 1.2 GW power campus to support Meta's data center needs. Oklo stock (NYSE: OKLO) jumped over 15% on Friday after Meta announced an agreement to support development of a 1.2-gigawatt advanced nuclear campus in Pike County, southern Ohio.\n\n### 2025 Key Milestones:\n• On September 22, 2025, Oklo broke ground on its first Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho.\n• Oklo was selected for 3 projects under the DOE's new Reactor Pilot Program, accelerating deployment timelines and complementing ongoing NRC work.\n• Completed an at-the-market fundraising program generating $540 million in gross proceeds to support growth.\n\n### Regulatory Progress:\n• Back in July, the company completed a phase 1 pre-application readiness assessment with the NRC. In a nutshell, this step basically confirmed that Oklo's microreactor design (Aurora) is ready for a deeper regulatory review. But for investors who remember 2022, when the NRC rejected Oklo's license application for insufficient information, completion of this phase is a meaningful sign of progress.\n\n## 12.

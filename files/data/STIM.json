(NASDAQ: STIM) is a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on non-invasive neuromodulation therapies for neurohealth disorders, primarily major depressive disorder (MDD). Its flagship product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, delivers transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy—a FDA-cleared, non-drug treatment for adults with MDD who failed one or more antidepressant medications. NeuroStar uses FDA-cleared protocols with demonstrated durability up to 12 months post-treatment. The system is also FDA-cleared for adjunctive treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) since March 2020.\n\nThe company has treated over 115,000 unique patients with more than 1.1 million sessions as of Q2 2024. Revenue is generated via capital sales/leases of NeuroStar systems (~$65K/system) to psychiatric practices, per-treatment fees, and SaaS-based TrakStar StarGuide software for patient tracking/reminders. Neuronetics operates primarily in the U.S., with ~800-900 active systems installed. In the $1.5B+ U.S. TMS market (growing 15-20% annually per industry estimates), NeuroStar holds dominant share due to first-mover advantage (FDA clearance 2008), extensive clinical data (over 100 peer-reviewed publications), and strong reimbursement (CPT codes with ~$350-450/session Medicare/private pay).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024 (Q2 2024 Earnings, verified via company 10-Q filed August 8, 2024):** Revenue $17.1M (+13% YoY); NeuroStar revenue $13.3M (+8%); TrakStar revenue $3.8M (+53% YoY, 75% gross margin).

At 0.8x 2024E EV/Revenue (vs. peers 3-5x), undervalued for 15% CAGR. Moderate risk appetite suits growth portfolio amid mental health tailwinds, but volatility high (beta 1.8).  \n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $2.50** (3x 2025E revenue of $90M, 40% upside). DCF implies $2.20-2.80 assuming 12% discount rate, EBITDA positivity 2026. *Valuation based on Q2 filings, management guidance, and comparable analysis (Oct 2024 data).*",

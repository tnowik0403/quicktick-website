(VRRM) is a vertically integrated hemp and CBD company headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Founded in 2017, it operates a 40-acre regenerative farm in Pueblo, Colorado, where it cultivates industrial hemp using sustainable, zero-pesticide methods. The company manufactures, distributes, and retails a wide range of hemp-derived cannabinoid products under brands like Veritas Farms, Veritas Chocolate, and Peak Eclipse. Products include tinctures, gummies, topicals, beverages, and chocolates, sold through e-commerce (veritasfarms.com), wholesale to retailers, and direct-to-consumer channels. Veritas emphasizes full-spectrum CBD with trace THC, terpenes, and other cannabinoids for the \"entourage effect,\" targeting wellness markets for pain relief, anxiety, sleep, and pet health.\n\nIn FY2023 (ended Dec 31, 2023), Veritas reported revenue of $5.0 million, down from prior years amid CBD market saturation. The firm pivoted to high-margin products and retail expansion post-Farm Bill 2018 hemp legalization. With OTCQB listing, it faces liquidity challenges but benefits from low-cost production.

Strong growth from retail/international (20% rev CAGR possible), but moderate risk from sector headwinds, debt, and OTC volatility. Suitable for growth portfolios tolerant of 30-50% swings.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $5.50 (90% upside). Based on 1.5x FY2025E sales ($7.5M rev at 20% growth, 50% margins) discounted 50% for risk; DCF implies $4.80-$6.20 (EV/EBITDA 8x peers). Catalysts: Q3 earnings (Nov 2024), retail ramp.",

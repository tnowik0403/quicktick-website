(NASDAQ: EQIX) is the world's leading digital infrastructure company, operating a global network of over 260 International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers across 33 countries on five continents as of Q2 2024. Founded in 1998, Equinix revolutionized the industry by pioneering carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection services, enabling seamless digital exchange between enterprises, cloud providers, financial institutions, and content/network providers. Its core offerings include colocation space (racks, power, cooling), interconnection platforms like Equinix Fabric (virtual network connectivity), Equinix Metal (bare metal as-a-service), and managed services such as Equinix Smart Data Management. \n\nThe company benefits from the explosive growth in cloud computing, AI, 5G, and edge computing, positioning itself as the \"digital highway\" for hyperscalers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure) and enterprises. Equinix's interconnection ecosystem hosts over 10,000 customers and 330,000 interconnections, generating high-margin recurring revenue (interconnections grew 15% YoY in Q2 2024).

Moderate risk from rates/capex offset by 99% occupancy and backlog.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $975 (8% upside from $904.62). Based on DCF (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth) and peers; implies 25x 2025 AFFO ($39/share). Hold for dividends; buy dips below $880. \n\n*Sources: Equinix IR (earnings/transcripts), Yahoo Finance (stock), Synergy Research (market share), Reuters/Bloomberg (news), Seeking Alpha (analyst consensus).*",

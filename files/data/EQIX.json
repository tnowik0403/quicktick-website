AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus:**\n- 19 analysts consensus rating: \"Strong Buy\" with average price target of $946.74, forecasting 23.90% increase.

However, premium valuation and near-term margin pressure from aggressive capex program limit upside at current levels.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $925-$975**\n\nBased on 22-24x 2026 AFFO estimates, reflecting premium to REIT sector but below current analyst targets to account for execution risks and high leverage during expansion phase. The company's unique positioning in AI infrastructure and network effects justify premium valuation, but current market price approaches optimistic scenarios.",

(CTRA) is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused on the development, exploration, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs) across premium U.S. basins. Formed in October 2021 via the merger of Cabot Oil & Gas and Cimarex Energy, Coterra operates in three core areas: the Permian Basin (Delaware Basin, primarily oil-weighted), Marcellus Shale (northeast Pennsylvania, natural gas dominant), and Eagle Ford Shale (south Texas, oil and gas mix). The company emphasizes low-cost, high-return inventory with a portfolio of ~3.8 million net acres, targeting ~20 years of drilling inventory at current paces. In 2023, Coterra produced ~2.4 Bcfe/d (billion cubic feet equivalent per day), with ~55% natural gas, ~30% NGLs, and ~15% oil. It prioritizes capital discipline, free cash flow generation (targeting $1.5-2.0B annually), and shareholder returns via dividends (current yield ~3.2%) and buybacks ($1.25B authorized through 2025). Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, Coterra employs ~400 people and maintains a strong balance sheet with net debt ~$1.2B (Q2 2024) and liquidity >$2.5B. The company navigates energy transition pressures by focusing on LNG export demand and oil resilience amid geopolitical tensions.

Company Overview (LRCX) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nLam Research Corporation designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits in the United States, China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Lam Research Corporation is an American supplier of wafer-fabrication equipment and related services to the semiconductor industry. Its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which involves the steps that create the active components of semiconductor devices and their wiring. Founded: January 1980 Revenue: $16.2 Billion (CY 2024) R&D: $2.0 Billion (CY 2024) Employees: ~18,300 (CY 2024) Headquarters: Fremont, California Stock ticker – Nasdaq: LRCX\n\nLam holds a strong position in deposition and etch, which address numerous critical steps in the fabrication process with the goal of reducing defect rates, improving yields, lowering costs and reducing the processing time. Its core competencies lie in areas such as nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, and advanced systems engineering. The company caters to the needs of semiconductor memory, foundry and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) by providing them with integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, enabling results on the wafer.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe all-time high Lam Research stock closing price was 220.40 on January 12, 2026. The Lam Research 52-week high stock price is 222.58, which is 1% above the current share price. The Lam Research 52-week low stock price is 56.32, which is 74.4% below the current share price.\n\nAs of today, Lam Research market cap is 255.07B. The Lam Research EPS (TTM) is 4.53. The Lam Research Corp stock price today is 203.08. PE Ratio (TTM) 40.83 · EPS (TTM) 4.77 · LRCX · 315.90% S&P 500 (^GSPC) 85.20%\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nLam Research's product portfolio spans four key areas:\n\n**Etch Products:** Lam's flagship products include the Kiyo® and Versys® etch systems. The primary technology, reactive ion etch (RIE), activates the wafer surface with ions (charged particles) to remove material. Advanced etch techniques, such as atomic layer etching (ALE) are capable of removing a few atomic layers of material at a time.\n\n**Deposition Products:** VECTOR® and ALTUS® deposition systems. Deposition processes create layers of dielectric (insulating) and metal (conducting) materials used to build a semiconductor device. Tiny tungsten connectors and thin barriers are made with the precision of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), which adds only a few layers of atoms at a time.\n\n**Strip & Clean Products:** SOLA® and Da Vinci® cleaning systems. Strip and clean techniques are used between manufacturing steps to eliminate unwanted material that could later lead to defects and to prepare the wafer surface for subsequent processing. Photoresist strip removes the photoresist film and residues following ion implant or etch steps. To clear away particles, contaminants, residues, and other unwanted materials, wafer cleaning steps are inserted throughout manufacturing.\n\n**Customer Support Business Group (CSBG):** Lam's Customer Support Business Group revenues comprise sales of customer service, spares, upgrades, and non-leading-edge equipment from Lam's Reliant product line. Customer support-related revenues and other revenues were $5.98 billion (40% of the total revenues).\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nLam Research stated that the breakthrough focuses on a new Kiyo etch solution that can process high-bow wafers bonded on glass carriers. This technology addresses challenges posed by warping or bowing of wafers during advanced packaging, enabling reliable and precise etching for complex device structures. The etch innovation enables manufacturers to achieve tighter interconnect spacing and more reliable through-silicon vias (TSVs). It also enables efficient stacking of dies, supporting the trend toward higher memory density, power efficiency, and faster bandwidth. Lam Research stated that the new Kiyo etch technology is designed to be compatible with glass carrier wafer processes. These are increasingly adopted for better thermal and mechanical performance in ultra-thin, high-bow silicon wafers.\n\nLam Research is focusing on its \"4-Horsemen\" technologies, including Gate All Around (GAA), Backside Power, Advanced Packaging, and Dry Resist. These innovations are anticipated to drive growth rates that exceed the overall Wafer Fabrication Equipment (WFE) market expansion, positioning Lam Research favorably against its competitors.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**AI Infrastructure Focus:** Lam's long-term strategy includes expanding its infrastructure to meet the AI era's demands.

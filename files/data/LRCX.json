All quantitative financials from verified sources <6 months old.*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nLam Research Corporation (LRCX) is a leading global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry, specializing in etch, deposition, and clean processes critical for advanced chip manufacturing. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Fremont, California, Lam enables the production of leading-edge logic, memory, and analog/power devices powering AI, 5G/6G, automotive, and high-performance computing (HPC). With ~15,000 employees worldwide, Lam holds a dominant position in plasma etch (~45% market share) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), serving foundries like TSMC, Intel, Samsung, and memory leaders like Micron/SK Hynix. In FY2025 (ended Jun 2025), systems revenue was ~85% of total, with services at 15%. Lam's innovations focus on Angstrom-era (sub-2nm) nodes, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI GPUs, and backside power delivery, aligning with explosive AI demand. The company reported record FY2025 revenue of $16.2B (verified Q4 FY2025 earnings, Jul 31, 2025), driven by AI tailwinds, positioning it for sustained growth amid semi capex cycles.

Founded in 1922 and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, CTS operates 13 facilities worldwide, with key manufacturing in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company focuses on mission-critical applications requiring high reliability, such as vehicle electrification, industrial automation, medical diagnostics, 5G infrastructure, and avionics.\n\nIn FY2023, CTS generated ~50% of revenue from Transportation (sensors for EV battery management, transmissions, and safety systems), 20% from Industrial (motion control, valves), 15% from Medical (diagnostic equipment, pumps), 10% from Communications (antennas, filters), and 5% from Defense/Aerospace. The firm emphasizes custom solutions, leveraging proprietary technologies like micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and advanced materials. With ~3,700 employees, CTS reported record adjusted operating margins in recent quarters amid a shift toward higher-margin electrification products. The company's strategy centers on organic growth through R&D (4-5% of sales), selective M&A, and market share gains in megatrends like EVs and medtech, positioning it as a mid-cap leader in precision sensing amid broader electronics decoupling risks.

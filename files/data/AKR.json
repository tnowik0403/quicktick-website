Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Rye, New York, AKR owns approximately 51 core properties totaling 10.1 million square feet as of Q2 2024, emphasizing resilient, necessity-based retail anchored by leading grocers like Stop & Shop, Acme Markets, and Wegmans. The company's strategy centers on a dual-platform model: a \"Core Portfolio\" of stabilized, high-occupancy assets generating predictable cash flows, and an \"Opportunity Funds\" platform for higher-return redevelopment and acquisitions in supply-constrained markets.\n\nAKR differentiates through its focus on irreplaceable locations with strong demographics (median household incomes often >$100K), achieving same-store NOI growth through proactive leasing and redevelopments. As of July 31, 2024, the core portfolio maintained 94.5% occupancy, bolstered by a tenant base resistant to e-commerce disruption. With a conservative balance sheet (debt-to-EBITDA ~6x), AKR has navigated post-pandemic retail challenges by divesting non-core assets and recycling capital into high-growth opportunities. The REIT reported AFFO of $0.48 per share in Q2 2024 (up 9% YoY from $0.44), reflecting operational resilience amid high interest rates.

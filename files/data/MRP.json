Founded in 1885 and listed on the JSE since 1953, MRP operates through five core brands: MRP (clothing and footwear), MRP Home (homeware and furniture), MRP Sport (activewear), Miladys (women's fashion), and Spot (family apparel). The company targets low- to middle-income consumers with a \"best value\" pricing model, emphasizing fast fashion, own-brand merchandise, and high inventory turnover. As of 30 Sep 2024, MRP ran 2,778 stores across South Africa (2,499), Botswana (101), Zimbabwe (80), Angola (38), and Nigeria (60), spanning ~1.7 million sqm of retail space. It generated R32.9 billion in FY24 revenue, with ~95% from South Africa. MRP's strategy revolves around store expansion (net +52 stores in H1 FY25), e-commerce growth (3.5% of sales), and private-label dominance (90%+ of merchandise). The group benefits from a vertically integrated supply chain with Asian sourcing hubs but faces macroeconomic pressures in a high-unemployment, low-growth SA economy.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **19 Nov 2024**: Released H1 FY25 unaudited interim results (6 months ended 30 Sep 2024).

Moderate risk (beta 0.9) fits portfolio.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: R165 (18% upside) – DCF-based (8% WACC, 5% perpetual growth); assumes 6% sales CAGR FY25-27, 37% margins recovery. Strong growth potential if consumer rebounds (GDP +1.5% 2025 est. by IMF). Entry below R145 attractive.",

Growth Strategy\n\nDycom's growth strategy centers on three key pillars:\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions**: The company completed its largest acquisition to date with Power Solutions, LLC (\"Power Solutions\"), one of the Mid-Atlantic's largest electrical contractors serving data centers, for a total consideration which values Power Solutions at $1.95 billion. The purchase price on a cash-free, debt-free basis was comprised of approximately $1.63 billion of cash, including an estimated working capital adjustment, and approximately 1.0 million shares of Dycom common stock.\n\n**Market Diversification**: \"This is a milestone acquisition for Dycom that diversifies our business and significantly enhances our potential to generate long-term growth and value creation,\" said Dan Peyovich, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dycom. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Dycom's Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets.\n\n**Technology-Driven Growth**: The telecommunications infrastructure environment is expanding as hyperscalers and large technology companies invest in long-haul and middle-mile fiber networks to support rising data usage and new compute requirements. Dycom is extensively benefiting from this favorable trend and is well-positioned to continue reaping benefits in the mid and long term as well.\n\n## 5.

AT&T was at $373 million, and Lumen was at $155.4 million of Dycom's revenue.\n\n**Customer Diversification Progress**: The company has diversified its customer base, reducing reliance on its top five customers from 66% of revenue in fiscal 2022 to 55% in fiscal 2025.\n\n**Emerging Hyperscaler Clients**: The company is expanding into direct relationships with hyperscale cloud providers for data center infrastructure projects, though specific client names are not disclosed for competitive reasons.\n\n## 6.

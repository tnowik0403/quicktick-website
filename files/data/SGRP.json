(NASDAQ: SGRP) is a global merchandising, marketing, and brand experience services provider headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. Founded in 1967, the company operates in over 40 countries, delivering end-to-end solutions for retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers. Core services include in-store merchandising (e.g., shelf stocking, planogram execution), product launches, audits, retail execution, and digital marketing campaigns. SPAR's model emphasizes technology-enabled field teams, using proprietary apps for real-time reporting and task management.\n\nThe company generates revenue primarily through long-term contracts with major retailers like Walmart, Target, and grocery chains, as well as CPG giants such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever. In fiscal 2023, international operations (Asia, Europe, Australia) accounted for ~70% of revenue, with North America ~30%. SPAR differentiates via scalability, with a workforce of ~28,000 field representatives activated on-demand. Recent focus shifts toward high-margin digital and e-commerce services amid retail digitization. Challenges include labor-intensive operations and contract volatility. Market cap reflects small-cap status, with shares trading at low multiples due to inconsistent profitability.

(STGW) is a digital-first marketing network and technology services company headquartered in New York City, operating as a challenger to the traditional \"Big Six\" holding companies (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic, Dentsu, Havas). Formed in 2021 from the merger of MDC Partners and Stagwell Group, it integrates over 13,000 specialists across 22 global offices, focusing on data-driven, performance-based marketing solutions. Stagwell's model emphasizes \"Marketing Intelligence Everywhere,\" leveraging proprietary platforms like Assembly (media), Channel Factory (YouTube brand safety), and Donut (TikTok influencer marketing) to deliver end-to-end services including strategy, creative, media buying, PR, influencer marketing, and CXM (customer experience management).\n\nThe company serves Fortune 500 brands across sectors like CPG, healthcare, tech, finance, and retail, prioritizing agility, AI integration, and measurable ROI over legacy TV/print dominance. In H1 2024, it reported net revenue growth amid a challenging ad market, driven by digital shifts and acquisitions. Stagwell's \"One Stagwell\" structure fosters collaboration across disciplines, positioning it for growth in a $1T+ global marketing services industry projected to expand at 5-7% CAGR through 2028 (per GroupM and eMarketer). Challenges include macroeconomic headwinds and client budget scrutiny, but its 90%+ client retention and tech stack provide differentiation.

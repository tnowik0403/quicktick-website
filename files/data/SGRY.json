(NASDAQ: SGRY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ real-time data):**  \n- Stock Price: $17.32  \n- Market Capitalization: $2.32 billion  \n- 52-Week Range: $15.00 - $37.12  \n- Trailing P/E: N/A (due to recent losses)  \n- Enterprise Value: $7.89 billion  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSurgery Partners, Inc. (SGRY) is a leading healthcare services provider specializing in the ownership, operation, and development of surgical facilities across the United States. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, the company operates a diversified network of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), surgical hospitals, and multi-specialty facilities, primarily focused on outpatient procedures in high-acuity specialties such as orthopedics, gastroenterology (GI), ophthalmology, and pain management. As of Q2 2024, SGRY owns or operates 141 facilities (129 ASCs and 12 surgical hospitals) across 36 states, performing over 659,000 cases annually. The company benefits from the secular shift toward lower-cost, higher-efficiency outpatient care, driven by Medicare reimbursement changes, payer preferences, and patient demand for convenience. SGRY employs a physician-partnered model, where surgeons hold equity stakes, aligning incentives for volume growth and clinical excellence. Revenue is generated through facility fees (same-facility and acquired), ancillary services (e.g., pathology, imaging), and optical services. With a focus on de novo developments and tuck-in acquisitions, SGRY has grown its footprint aggressively, achieving 21% compounded annual growth in cases from 2019-2023. However, high leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA ~6.5x as of Q2 2024) and procedural volume pressures from staffing shortages pose risks.

Market size: $150B+ US outpatient ortho/GI by 2028. | Labor inflation (wages +6% YoY); Proposed Medicare cuts (-2.9% physician fee 2025); Recession risks curbing elective volumes. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Offerings:** ASCs (orthopedics 28% of cases, GI 25%, ophthalmology 15%, pain 12%); Surgical hospitals for complex cases; Ancillaries (pathology labs, imaging, optical dispensaries generating 15% of revenue).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Pipeline:** 4 de novo ASCs under construction (Q4 2024 openings in high-growth Sunbelt states); Orthopedic bundle pilots with payers (3 sites, launch Q1 2025).\n- **Tech Initiatives:** AI-driven scheduling platform rollout (Q3 2024) to boost utilization 5%; Expanded pathology JV with Sonic Healthcare (announced June 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations and Forecast\n- **Current U.S. ASC Market (~7,000 centers, $100B+ revenue):** SGRY ~2.5% by case volume (~1% by facilities); #3 player behind USPI (~20%) and Optum SCA (~15%).\n- **Forecast:** +50-100bps market share gain by 2026 via 20-30 annual facility adds; Same-facility growth 4-6% supports outpacing fragmented independents (1-2% growth).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | SGRY | USPI (Private) | Optum SCA | Envision (Private) |\n|----------------------------|------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Facilities | 141 | 500+ | 200+ | 150+ |\n| Rev Growth YoY | 17% | 12% | 10% | 8% |\n| EBITDA Margin | 23% | 28% | 25% | 20% |\n| Leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA) | 6.5x | 4.0x | 3.5x | 5.0x |\n| **Edge** | Acquisition agility | Scale/network | Payer integration | Physician depth |\n\nSGRY trades at EV/EBITDA 9.5x 2024E (vs. peers 10-12x), reflecting leverage discount.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships:** Equity JVs with physicians (80% facilities); Payer contracts (e.g., UnitedHealth bundle ortho deals); Sonic Healthcare pathology JV.\n- **M&A:** 16 acquisitions in 2023 (e.g., $525M Aisling deal Nov 2023); 2024 YTD: Covenant ($300M), 4 tuck-ins ($100M+).\n- **Major Clients:** Health systems (e.g., HCA, Tenet JVs); Insurers (BCBS, Aetna narrow networks); High-volume referrers: 500+ surgeon partners.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Strong patient safety (99% complication-free); Diversity (40% women in leadership).\n- **Management:** CEO Mike Greiner (ex-TeamHealth) since 2021; Track record of 20%+ CAGR.\n- **Sentiment:** Positive analyst coverage (9 Buys, avg PT $34 per Seeking Alpha/Consensus Oct 2024); Online buzz on Reddit/StockTwits focuses on ASC tailwinds, M&A momentum.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10** (Strong Buy for growth portfolios; Hold for conservatives due to debt). Upside from execution on 15%+ growth, margin to 25%, de-leveraging to 5x by 2026 amid sector tailwinds.

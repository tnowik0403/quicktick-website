(formerly Meta Financial Group) is a U.S.-based financial holding company headquartered in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, providing integrated banking and payment solutions primarily through its Banking Segment and Money Movement Services Segment. The company focuses on underserved markets, including the underbanked population, tax refund processing, and business banking for fintech partners via its Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. Pathward operates under the Pathward brand and serves consumers, businesses, and financial institutions through digital-first products like prepaid cards, debit networks, and deposit accounts.\n\nKey revenue streams include net interest income from deposits/loans (consumer finance, tax refund advances), fee income from payments processing, and BaaS partnerships enabling fintechs (e.g., prepaid/debit programs). With ~$8.5B in total assets (Q2 FY2025), Pathward emphasizes compliant growth amid regulatory scrutiny on BaaS. It has pivoted from legacy tax refund reliance to diversified BaaS (60%+ of deposits) and commercial lending.

Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company specializes in premium, all-black Maxeon solar panels known for superior efficiency (up to 22.8% module efficiency) and 40-year warranties, differentiating it from lower-cost competitors. SunPower historically operated through two segments: SunPower Residential (distributed generation sales, leasing, and installations) and SunPower Commercial & Industrial (C&I) plus Blue Raven Solar (dealer network). It also offered SunVault™ energy storage and SunPower Design Studio software for custom solar systems.\n\nPre-bankruptcy, SunPower emphasized a direct-to-consumer model with in-house sales, financing via Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and loans, and a focus on sustainability. However, persistent losses from high interest rates, inventory glut, California market slowdown (due to net metering changes), and Chinese oversupply led to its downfall. On August 5, 2024, SunPower filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection (Case No. 24-90322, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware) with ~$1.5B in assets and $1.6B in liabilities. The filing aims for an orderly wind-down or asset sale, primarily its residential business to Complete Solaria. Post-filing, operations continue minimally under debtor-in-possession financing (~$65M from Cerberus Capital). SunPower's market position has eroded dramatically, with shares collapsing >98% YTD.

Legacy plans included international expansion (Europe, Australia) and utility-scale via PowerPlant contracts.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category     | Headwinds                                                                 | Tailwinds                                      |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Bankruptcy proceedings (creditor battles, operational halts), $1.6B debt load, inventory overhang (~$300M pre-filing), leadership exodus (CEO Peter Faricy out July 2024). | Potential asset sales unlocking ~$45-200M value; strong IP in Maxeon panels (spun off 2020). |\n| **Sector**  | High U.S. interest rates crushing solar financing (30% installs drop YTD), CA NEM 3.0 reforms (-80% residential demand), Chinese dumping (panels <$0.20/W), policy uncertainty (IRA credits at risk). | IRA tax credits (30-50% boost), falling battery costs, data center/AI power demand; U.S. content bonuses for domestic manufacturing. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Maxeon Solar Panels**: High-efficiency modules (6.7kW residential systems).\n- **SunVault™ Storage**: 13-26kWh batteries integrated with Equinox® systems.\n- **SunPower Financial**: PPAs, loans, leases (historically 50%+ revenue).\n- **Design Studio & Monitoring**: AI-driven software for system optimization.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Equinox® 3.0 (launched Q1 2024)**: All-in-one rooftop system with storage; delayed rollout due to bankruptcy.\n- **Planned (pre-bankruptcy)**: Hyper-X panels for data centers (2025 target); no updates post-filing.\n- **Development Halted**: Utility-scale Oasis™ platform mothballed.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- U.S. Residential Solar Modules: ~5-7% (2023 Wood Mackenzie data; declined to <3% in 2024 amid sales drop).\n- Overall U.S. Solar Installs: <2% (dominated by Sunrun ~15%, Tesla ~10%).\n- Global High-Efficiency Segment: ~10% via Maxeon brand.\n\n**Forecast**: Sharp decline to ~0% post-bankruptcy as assets divest; Complete Solaria may inherit <1% residual share.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Company (Ticker) | Market Cap (Oct 10) | Revenue (LTM) | Key Strengths vs. SPWR                  | SPWR Edge (Pre-BK)       |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Sunrun (RUN)** | $2.8B              | $2.1B        | Scale (800k+ installs), leasing focus  | Higher efficiency panels |\n| **Enphase (ENPH)** | $14.5B            | $1.4B        | Microinverters (90% share)             | Integrated systems      |\n| **First Solar (FSLR)** | $18.2B          | $3.3B        | Utility-scale thin-film leader         | Residential premium     |\n| **SolarEdge (SEDG)** | $1.4B            | $1.0B        | Power optimizers                       | Warranty length         |\n| **Complete Solaria** (Private) | N/A          | ~$200M est.  | Acquiring SPWR residential             | N/A                     |\n\nSPWR lags in scale/cost; bankruptcy widens gap.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Maxeon Solar (spun-off subsidiary, ongoing panel supply); TotalEnergies (historical investor); hyperscalers (e.g., Microsoft pilots pre-BK).\n- **M&A**:\n  | Date       | Deal                  | Details                          |\n  |------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n  | Aug 2023  | Blue Raven Solar     | $32M acquisition (dealer network)|\n  | Sep 2024  | Residential Sale     | To Complete Solaria ($45M cash) |\n- No new M&A post-filing.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Residential homeowners (via dealers), C&I (e.g., Walmart, IKEA legacy), utilities (PG&E PowerPlant).\n- **Potential**: Data centers (e.g., Google, Amazon hyperscalers scoped pre-BK); stalled by bankruptcy.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong (40-year warranty, recyclable panels); CDP A-list 2023.\n- **Management**: Interim CEO Julien Lederman (post-Faricy); high turnover risk.\n- **Sentiment**: Bearish (Seeking Alpha \"Sell\" consensus; short interest ~20% pre-delist). Litigation risks from lease holders.\n- **Intellectual Property**: 1,200+ patents (Maxeon tech valuable).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **1/10 (Strong Sell)** – Bankruptcy liquidation risks total shareholder wipeout; minimal recovery prospects even in asset sales. Avoid for growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.05-$0.10 (implies 0-30% upside from $0.076; based on ~$200M total asset sale value vs. $1.6B debt, zero equity cushion. Moderate risk appetite cannot justify; high volatility expected through Q4 2024 court proceedings). Hold only for speculative recovery; otherwise, sell immediately.",

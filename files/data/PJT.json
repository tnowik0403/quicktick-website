PJT advises on complex, high-value transactions, often megadeals (> $10B), serving blue-chip clients like Microsoft, Broadcom, and Apollo Global. With ~250 managing directors/partners (as of Q2 2024) across 10 global offices (NY HQ, London, HK, etc.), PJT emphasizes elite talent retention, low leverage (no investment banking conflicts), and performance-based comp.

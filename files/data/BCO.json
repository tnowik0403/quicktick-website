Founded in 1859 and headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Brink's core business revolves around armored transportation, ATM replenishment and management, cash processing, and digital retail solutions that help merchants optimize cash handling amid declining physical currency usage. The company serves banks, retailers, jewelers, and government entities, generating ~70% of revenue from North America and Latin America.\n\nBrink's has evolved from traditional cash-in-transit (CIT) services to a diversified platform including Brink's Complete (end-to-end cash management), Global Services (international expansion), and Digital Retail Solutions (AI-driven cash forecasting and recycling). In Q3 2024, the company reported organic revenue growth of 10.5%, driven by pricing discipline, volume gains, and share recapture in core markets. With a fleet of ~10,000 armored vehicles and 80,000+ employees, Brink's emphasizes technology integration—like IoT sensors and AI analytics—to boost efficiency and margins. Despite secular cash declines in developed markets, tailwinds from emerging markets and digital diversification position it for mid-single-digit growth.

Rationale: Q3 beats + raised guidance signal durable growth (10%+ organic) amid undervaluation (14x P/E vs. 18x peers); Digital/LATAM tailwinds outweigh cash secular risks. Moderate risk via debt but offset by FCF ($250M 2024E).\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $128** (20% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% CAGR to 2028, 12x terminal EBITDA multiple, incorporating Q3 fundamentals and 2025E EBITDA $975M). Aligns with Barclays/Jefferies PTs for growth-oriented portfolio.",

Growth Strategy\n\n### Three Strategic Pillars\nZimmer Biomet's growth strategy is anchored in innovation, strategic acquisitions, and expanding its global footprint. The company's commitment to developing cutting-edge technologies, as evidenced by its pursuit of robotics and AI in surgical procedures, is central to its future. This focus aims to improve patient outcomes and surgical efficiency, differentiating its offerings in a competitive market.\n\n### ASC Focus\nCEO Ivan Tornos explains the \"three P's of the ASC strategy\": First, dedicated people with a dedicated President and sales channel for ASCs. Today we got dedicated people with a dedicated President going over to an ASC, so a dedicated sales channel. The second P is around partnerships. We need to have the right partners. We have an exclusive partnership with Getinge, the Swedish company.\n\n### Innovation Investment\nFor the quarter ending March 31, 2025, Zimmer Biomet's research and development expenses reached $0.111 billion, representing a 2.5% increase year-over-year, underscoring their commitment to innovation.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Target Markets\nIt serves orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, hospitals, stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, and other specialists, as well as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations, or buying groups. In Q1 2025, 20% of its U.S. business came from ASCs. This focus is supported by strategic partnerships aimed at expanding its presence in the ASC market.\n\n### ASC Growth\nA growing part of the U.S. healthcare landscape, more than 22.5 million procedures are performed in ASCs annually. The global market is projected to grow steadily, driven by cost efficiency, convenience, and advances in MedTech. The collaboration comes as orthopedic surgeries increasingly shift from hospitals to ASCs, which now perform more than 22 million procedures annually in the U.S. alone.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\nGlobal MedTech companies Getinge and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. announced a strategic partnership where Zimmer Biomet will distribute Getinge's Operating Room (OR) capital products to its Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) customers. This partnership creates a turnkey solution for ASC customers, who can now access Getinge's infection control and surgical portfolio and Zimmer Biomet's broad menu of best-in-class implants and surgical robotics from a single source.\n\nA key example is the partnership with CBRE Group, Inc., announced in May 2024, to develop orthopedic ASCs. We are the only company that can do real estate through CBRE, you know, A to C, soup to nuts.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Latest Financial Results\nFourth quarter net sales of $2.023 billion increased 4.3% and 4.9% on a constant currency basis. Full-year net sales of $7.679 billion increased The company reported net sales of $7.679 billion in 2024, underscoring its significant market presence and financial strength.\n\n### Q3 2024 Performance\nThird quarter net sales of $1.824 billion increased 4.0% and 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.23; adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74 The company achieved net earnings of $249.1 million, or $353.2 million on an adjusted basis.

Product Category Growth: Knee sales rose by 5.5% to $745.1 million, and hip sales increased by 3.5% to $481.5 million.\n\n### Free Cash Flow\n2024 Full Year Free Cash Flow Guidance: Approximately $1 billion. Zimmer Biomet experienced a successful year in 2023, with notable achievements such as revenue growth of 7.5 percent, adjusted earnings per share growth of almost 9.5 percent, and generating nearly a billion dollars in free cash flow.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\nThis demographic shift is a powerful tailwind for Zimmer Biomet, as an aging populace directly correlates with a higher incidence of degenerative orthopedic conditions such as osteoarthritis, a primary driver for joint replacement surgeries. Over the next few years, tailwinds include aging populations, which tend to need surgical interventions at higher rates.\n\nAn aging and increasing active population, technological advancements improving patient care dynamics globally, the shift of procedures to outpatient settings like the ASC as well as data showcasing best-in-class clinical outcomes are acting as major tailwinds here. The increasing integration of AI and robotics into surgical procedures could also create opportunities for differentiation and innovation.\n\n### Headwinds\nZimmer Biomet operates in a market where healthcare providers and payers are constantly pushing for lower costs, leading to significant pricing pressure on its products. This intense competition can directly impact the company's profit margins. Furthermore, evolving reimbursement policies and potential reductions in healthcare spending by governments and private insurers pose a risk. For instance, shifts in Medicare reimbursement rates for orthopedic procedures could affect demand for Zimmer Biomet's higher-priced devices.\n\nHowever, the industry faces headwinds including potential supply chain vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and more widespread efforts to make healthcare less costly. The revised EPS guidance and elevated debt remind that execution risks—integration, tariffs, and regulatory costs—are material.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Knee and Hip Market Leadership\nIn the knee market, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker and JNJ DePuy are the top-three market leaders with a 33%, 29% and 16% share, respectively, followed by Smith & Nephew with 11% share. In the hip market, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker and JNJ DePuy are the top-three market leaders with a 25%, 24% and 21% share, respectively, followed by Smith & Nephew with 9% share.\n\n### Overall Market Position\nWith the acquisitions of Centerpulse in 2003 and Biomet in 2015, Zimmer holds the leading share of the reconstructive market in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Roughly two-thirds of total revenue is derived from sales of large joints; another fourth comes from extremities, trauma, sports medicine, and related surgical products.\n\n### Market Concentration\nThe top four companies in the orthopedic implant market collectively command a substantial portion, holding approximately 80% or more of the market share in both the knee and hip segments. This indicates a highly concentrated competitive environment.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Main Competitors\nStryker, Johnson & Johnson's DePuy Synthes, and Zimmer Biomet are three of the largest and most well-known orthopedic device companies in the industry. Most of the orthopedic device market is divided between four companies: Stryker, J&J, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew.\n\n### Competitive Performance\nStryker is a major competitor, with orthopedic net sales of $9.1 billion in 2024. It holds substantial market share in knee (29%) and hip implants (24%). Its MAKO robotic technology is a significant differentiator. Zimmer Biomet knee growth fell below Stryker but above Johnson & Johnson, while Hips were softest among the three.\n\n### Trauma Market\nJohnson & Johnson MedTech, through DePuy Synthes, is a leader in the trauma market with over 45% share. It also maintains significant positions in knee (16%) and hip (21%) markets. J&J has a more than 50% share of the orthopedic trauma market, competing with Stryker.\n\n### Robotics Competition\nWhile the company's Velys system is now available for knees, DePuy Synthes is lagging behind both Stryker and Zimmer Biomet in market share and innovation. In late 2013, Stryker had the first mover advantage when it acquired MAKO Surgical and has more than 2,000 systems installed worldwide at year-end 2024.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Major Acquisitions\nThe most recent acquisition was Monogram, an Austin-based developer of orthopedic implants using 3D printing technology founded in 2016.

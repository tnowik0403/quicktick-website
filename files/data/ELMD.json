(ELMD) is a Minnesota-based medical technology company specializing in non-invasive airway clearance therapy (ACT) products for patients with compromised pulmonary function due to acute and chronic respiratory conditions, neuromuscular diseases, and post-operative needs. Founded in 1992 and public since 2010, the company designs, manufactures, and markets its flagship SmartVest® platform, a high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) system that uses inflatable garments and a programmable generator to deliver percussive pressure waves, mobilizing mucus for clearance without invasive procedures. This addresses needs in conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, ALS, muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nELMD operates primarily in the U.S. homecare market (95%+ of revenue), selling directly to patients via reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers, with growing international presence through distributors. The company emphasizes patient-centric innovation, with ~90% recurring revenue from garment replacements (every 4-5 years).

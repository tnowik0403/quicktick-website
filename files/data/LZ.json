(LZ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $6.72 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.28 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $6.14 - $15.15  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nLegalZoom.com Inc. (LZ) is a leading online platform for legal services, empowering small businesses, entrepreneurs, and individuals to access affordable, on-demand legal solutions without traditional attorney costs. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Glendale, California, the company offers a subscription-based model alongside one-time services, streamlining processes like business formation (LLCs, corporations), estate planning (wills, trusts), intellectual property (trademarks), family law (divorces), and compliance (annual reports). LZ operates in the $200+ billion U.S. legal services market, targeting underserved SMBs and consumers who avoid high lawyer fees (average $300+/hour). Its tech-driven platform uses automation, AI, and attorney networks for 99% of services self-serve, with 15,000+ attorneys available for consultations. As of Q2 2024, LZ had 2.1 million subscribers (up 13% YoY), serving over 5 million customers historically. Revenue mix: ~71% subscriptions (recurring), 29% transactional. The company went public in 2021 via SPAC (Thoma Bravo sponsor) and has pivoted to subscription growth amid post-pandemic normalization. LZ's mission democratizes legal access, with strong brand recognition (top-of-mind for online business formation per surveys) and sticky economics (LTV:CAC >3x). Challenges include macroeconomic sensitivity and competition, but tailwinds from SMB digital adoption position it for mid-teens revenue growth.

(NASDAQ: EVER) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $24.12\n- **Market Capitalization**: $716.4 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $5.36 - $27.67\n- **Avg. Daily Volume (3 months)**: 1.2 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (recent profitability)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $678 million\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEverQuote, Inc. (EVER) operates a digital insurance marketplace platform that connects consumers seeking insurance quotes with a network of agents, carriers, and financial professionals. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the company leverages data science, machine learning, and proprietary algorithms to match shoppers with personalized insurance options across auto, home & renters, Medicare, life, health, and commercial lines. In 2023, EverQuote facilitated over 20 million quote requests, generating revenue primarily through variable commissions (paid by partners per qualified lead) and fixed fees.\n\nThe platform's core value lies in its consumer acquisition expertise, high-intent traffic from SEO, paid search, and TV/digital ads, and a carrier-direct model that bypasses traditional brokers. Auto insurance remains the largest segment (~80% of Q2 2024 variable revenue), but diversification into health/Medicare (up 150% YoY in Q2) and life/health is accelerating. EverQuote went public in 2018 and achieved its first GAAP profitable quarter in Q2 2024 amid a post-pandemic insurance market recovery. With ~450 employees, it competes in the $6B+ U.S. online lead generation sector, emphasizing scalability, shopper conversion (e.g., 20-25% call completion rates), and regulatory compliance (e.g., TCPA). Recent profitability and 74% YoY revenue growth signal a pivot from losses to sustainable expansion, positioning it for multi-year compounding in digital insurance distribution.

(NYSE: EIGI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of October 11, 2024 close, sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and company investor relations):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price         | $48.12        |\n| Market Capitalization | $1.17B      |\n| 52-Week High/Low    | $55.15 / $36.77 |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM)     | 10.2          |\n| Dividend Yield (Fwd)| 2.5%          |\n| Beta                | 0.45          |\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nEmployers Holdings, Inc. (EIGI) is a specialty insurance holding company specializing in workers' compensation insurance for small and select mid-size businesses across the United States. Operating through its subsidiaries—Employers Insurance Group and Employers Compensation Insurance Company—it underwrites policies that protect employers from employee injury claims, covering medical treatments, lost wages, and rehabilitation. The company focuses on businesses with 1-100 employees in low-to-medium hazard industries like retail, hospitality, and professional services, avoiding high-risk sectors like construction.\n\nFounded in 2007 via a carve-out from Employers Reinsurance Corp., EIGI emphasizes disciplined underwriting, agent partnerships (over 1,000 independent agents/brokers), and loss prevention services via its Cerity claims management unit. It generated $881 million in 2023 gross written premiums, with a policyholder retention rate above 85%. Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, EIGI maintains an A- (Excellent) rating from AM Best, reflecting strong balance sheet (risk-based capital >400%) and conservative reserving. Unlike diversified P&C giants, EIGI's mono-line focus enables niche expertise but exposes it to workers' comp cycle risks. It pays consistent dividends (18+ years) and repurchases shares opportunistically.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified from 10-Q filing and earnings call transcript via company IR and Seeking Alpha):\n  | Key Metric (Q2 2024) | Value              | YoY Change |\n  |----------------------|--------------------|------------|\n  | Net Premiums Earned  | $233.8M           | +3.1%     |\n  | Net Income           | $28.0M ($1.15/share)| +16.7%   |\n  | Gross Written Premiums | $267.2M        | +4.2%     |\n  | Combined Ratio       | 97.2%             | Improved  |\n  | Policy Count         | 106,000           | +1.5%     |\n  - CEO Doug Dirks highlighted rate increases of 6.2% and stable payroll exposure.\n- **September 12, 2024**: Quarterly dividend raised to $0.30/share (payable Oct 18, 2024), marking 7th consecutive increase (company press release).\n- **October 7, 2024**: Announced Q3 2024 earnings release on November 7, 2024 (company IR).\n- Online discussions (StockTwits, Reddit r/stocks, Seeking Alpha threads as of Oct 11): Bullish on dividend hike and undervaluation (P/E <11x); concerns over California regulatory scrutiny on rates.

(NASDAQ: BLMN) is a leading casual dining restaurant company that owns, operates, and franchises approximately 1,450 restaurants across 48 states in the U.S. and 20 countries globally as of Q2 2024. Its portfolio includes four primary brands: Outback Steakhouse (over 1,000 locations, focusing on steaks, ribs, and bold flavors with an Australian theme), Carrabba’s Italian Grill (Italian-American cuisine), Bonefish Grill (seafood with wood-grill emphasis), and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar (upscale steaks and premium wines). The company generates revenue through company-owned restaurants (U.S. and international), franchised units, and international operations, with Brazil representing a key growth market via a 10% ownership in Bloomin’ Brasil (operator of over 1,100 Outback units). BLMN emphasizes value-driven menus, off-premise sales (takeout/delivery), and digital ordering to adapt to consumer shifts post-COVID. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 8, 2024), total revenues were $1.12 billion (down 4.4% YoY), U.S. comparable sales declined 3.6%, but Brazil comps rose 10.5%. The company faces sector headwinds like traffic declines but benefits from international strength and cost controls.

Attractive yield and sale speculation provide 20-30% upside, but U.S. weakness and debt cap growth. Moderate risk portfolio suits as defensive play.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $11.00/share (30% upside). Based on 8x 2025 EV/EBITDA ($900M est., consensus), incorporating 50% probability of sale at 10x multiple.

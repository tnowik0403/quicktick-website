Formed in 2015 following the split from HP Inc., HPE focuses on hybrid cloud, AI-driven computing, high-performance computing (HPC), intelligent edge solutions, and as-a-service offerings via its GreenLake platform. The company serves enterprise customers across industries like financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and government, enabling digital transformation through servers (e.g., ProLiant), storage (e.g., Alletra, Nimble), networking (Aruba), and software-defined solutions.\n\nHPE's strategy emphasizes \"as-a-service\" consumption models to drive recurring revenue, with GreenLake now supporting over 8,000 customers and $1.4 billion in annualized revenue run-rate as of Q3 FY2024 (ended July 31, 2024). The company is heavily investing in AI infrastructure, partnering with Nvidia for GPU-accelerated systems, and positioning itself in the booming data center market. In FY2024 (ended October 31, 2023), HPE reported $29.1 billion in revenue, with key growth in AI-related server demand offsetting declines in traditional storage and networking. HPE's competitive moat lies in its end-to-end portfolio, global scale (170+ countries), and shift toward high-margin AI and edge computing, though it faces margin pressures from macroeconomic headwinds and competition.

(FOXF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 14, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $48.27\n- Market Capitalization: $2.02 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $39.67 - $66.20\n- Trailing P/E: 25.4x\n- Forward P/E: 11.8x\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nFox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF) is a leading designer, engineer, manufacturer, and marketer of performance-defining ride dynamics products, including shocks, forks, and suspension systems. The company serves multiple markets: mountain bikes (Specialized, Trek), powered vehicles like side-by-side (SSV) UTVs (Polaris, Can-Am), on-road vehicles with off-road capabilities (e.g., Ford F-150 Raptor, Ram 1500 TRX), motorcycles, and lifestyle products (e.g., bike racks, apparel). Headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, FOXF operates globally with ~5,000 employees across facilities in the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia.  \n\nThe business is divided into two segments: **Specialty Sports Group (SSG)** (~35% of revenue, focused on mountain bikes and accessories) and **Powered Vehicles Group (PVG)** (~65%, covering UTVs, trucks, SUVs, and motorcycles). FOXF emphasizes premium, proprietary technologies like FOX Live Valve (auto-adjusting suspension) and 2-position adjusters. With a strong emphasis on OEM partnerships, the company benefits from secular tailwinds in outdoor recreation, off-roading, and electrification. In FY2023 (ended Dec 30, 2023), FOXF generated $1.64B in revenue, but faced cyclical pressures from inventory destocking. Recent recovery signals robust demand, positioning FOXF as a growth play in fragmented markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 1, 2024)**: Revenue $438.2M (+8% YoY), gross margin 36.3% (up 40bps), adjusted EBITDA $102.5M (23.4% margin), adjusted EPS $1.73 (beat estimates by $0.16).

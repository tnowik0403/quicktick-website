(NYSE: IDA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 7, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $118.25 (as of market close November 7, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $6.37 billion (as of November 7, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $93.16 - $127.24  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nIDACORP, Inc. (IDA) is a holding company primarily focused on the regulated electric utility sector through its main subsidiary, Idaho Power Company, which serves approximately 620,000 customers across a 24,000-square-mile service territory spanning Idaho (95% of customers) and small portions of Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. The company generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electricity, with a regulated rate base of about $6.3 billion as of year-end 2023. Idaho Power's generation portfolio is diversified, including hydroelectric (about 60% of capacity), natural gas, coal (phasing out), and growing renewables like wind and solar. The utility benefits from Idaho's population growth (fastest in the U.S. at ~2% annually), industrial expansion, and increasing data center demand, driving load growth forecasts of 2-3% annually through 2034.\n\nIDACORP emphasizes reliability, affordability, and clean energy transition, with capital investments focused on grid modernization, renewables, and transmission to support economic development. It maintains a strong balance sheet with investment-grade credit ratings (A-/A3 from S&P/Moody's) and a consistent dividend policy (52-year streak, current yield ~2.9%). Unlike diversified utilities, IDA's regional focus insulates it from broader market volatility but exposes it to hydrology risks (hydro-dependent) and regulatory oversight by the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC). Recent strategic shifts include aggressive clean energy goals (100% clean by 2045) amid rising demand from tech hyperscalers.

No active pipeline (per 10-Q).\n- **Major Clients:** Micron (10% industrial sales), Simplot (agri), Boise Cascade. **Potential:** Microsoft/Amazon data centers (Idaho sites scouted 2024); EV charging networks.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Top-quartile MSCI rating (AA); 2045 carbon-free goal aligns with IRA incentives ($100M+ tax credits expected).\n- **Management:** CEO J. Murdock (since 2023) focused on growth; low turnover.\n- **Risks:** 20% earnings volatility from hydro; rate case lags (last increase 2023).\n- **Online Sentiment:** Bullish on Reddit/StockTwits (data center hype); analyst consensus \"Moderate Buy\" (avg PT $128, per MarketBeat 11/7/24).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy) – Attractive for growth upside from data centers/load (10-15% EPS CAGR potential), defensive utility moat, and 3% yield. Moderate risk from rates/hydrology offset by balance sheet strength.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $135 (14% upside) – Based on DCF (8% WACC, 2.5% perp growth), 13x 2025E EPS ($10.00), peer avg multiple. Strong growth portfolio with moderate risk favors entry below $120.",

Limited strong growth for aggressive portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $95 (9-10% upside from $87.22). DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% perp growth) using Q2 2024 fundamentals + 5% EPS CAGR to 2028; aligns with 16x fwd P/E peer avg. Moderate risk (beta 0.8) suits balanced portfolios, but monitor Fed cuts for re-rating.",

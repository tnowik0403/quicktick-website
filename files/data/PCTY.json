Rationale: 15%+ growth trajectory undervalued at 28x forward earnings (peers 30-40x); Q4 beat + AI catalysts support 20%+ upside. Moderate risk via SMB exposure offset by retention moat.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $210 (30% upside from $162). DCF-based (15% growth 3yrs tapering to 8%, 10% WACC, 4% terminal); aligns with analyst consensus PT range $180-$230. Hold if risk-averse; accumulate on dips below $155.",

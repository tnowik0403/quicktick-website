(LNSR) is a commercial-stage medical technology company specializing in advanced femtosecond laser systems for refractive cataract surgery. Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, LENSAR's flagship ALLY Adaptive Cataract Treatment System, FDA-approved in August 2023, integrates imaging, planning, laser capsulotomy, lens fragmentation, and astigmatism correction into a single platform. This system aims to enhance precision, efficiency, and outcomes in cataract procedures, which affect over 4 million U.S. patients annually. The company generates revenue primarily from system sales (capital equipment) and recurring procedure fees via proprietary LensAR Streamline consumables. LENSAR targets ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), hospitals, and private practices in the $1B+ U.S. femtosecond laser cataract market, with expanding international presence in Europe and Asia. Founded in 2004, it went public via SPAC in 2021. With a focus on AI-driven automation and surgeon workflow optimization, LENSAR positions itself as an innovator in a sector driven by aging demographics (global cataracts expected to rise 50% by 2050 per WHO).

ALLY traction, procedure momentum, and low valuation (EV/Sales 2.5x fwd) support re-rating.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $12.00** (110% upside): DCF-based (15% discount rate, 25% 5-yr CAGR terminal 3%; peers 4-6x sales). Catalysts: Q3 earnings Nov 2024, Europe ramp. Hold below $4; sell above $15.",

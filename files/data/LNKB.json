In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(LNKB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: October 11, 2024*  \n*Data sourced from real-time searches via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company filings (SEC EDGAR), earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 call on July 22, 2024), company IR site (linkbancorp.com), and news outlets (Business Wire, PR Newswire, American Banker). All financial metrics from Q2 2024 10-Q (filed July 26, 2024) and earnings release—verified <6 months old. Stock data as of market close October 11, 2024.*\n\n## Company Overview\nLinkbancorp Incorporated (LNKB) is a Pennsylvania-based bank holding company headquartered in Camp Hill, PA, operating as the parent of LinkBank. Formed through the 2022 merger of The Bank of Landisburg (est. 1874) and Keen National Bank (est. 1870), it went public via NYSE listing in July 2023 following a business combination with FG Merger Corp II (SPAC). LinkBank focuses on commercial banking in central and south-central Pennsylvania, with 22 full-service branches across counties like Cumberland, Dauphin, and York. It serves small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), professionals, and consumers with core offerings in deposits, commercial real estate (CRE) loans (58% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (25%), and residential mortgages.\n\nThe bank emphasizes relationship banking, organic growth, and opportunistic M&A to expand footprint. As of Q2 2024, assets totaled $2.1 billion, loans $1.6 billion, and deposits $1.7 billion. LNKB differentiates via high-touch service in underserved rural/suburban markets, digital enhancements (e.g., online banking upgrades), and a conservative CRE strategy amid sector scrutiny. Recent M&A (e.g., Monroe Bank & Trust acquisition closing Q4 2024) positions it for 50%+ deposit growth. Challenges include net interest margin (NIM) pressure from high funding costs (4.8% deposit beta) and deposit competition. With a TCE/TA ratio of 8.5% and CET1 of 10.2%, it maintains strong capital for growth. Market cap ~$158M reflects micro-cap status, trading at 0.9x TBV.

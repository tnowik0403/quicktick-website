Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Shenzhen, BYD has evolved from a battery manufacturer into the world's largest plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) producer by sales volume, surpassing Tesla in quarterly EV sales as of Q4 2023 and maintaining leadership through 2024. The company employs vertical integration across its supply chain, producing its proprietary Blade Battery (LFP chemistry known for safety and longevity), electric motors, and semiconductors, which enables cost advantages in a competitive market. In 2023, BYD sold 3.02 million NEVs (including BEVs and PHEVs), accounting for ~21% of global EV sales. Its automotive segment dominates revenue, but diversified businesses like energy storage (e.g., batteries for grid and home use) and electronics (e.g., power tools) provide stability. BYD's \"DM-i\" hybrid tech and affordable models like the Seagull have driven mass-market adoption in China, while exports to 70+ countries (e.g., Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America) fuel international growth. As of H1 2024, BYD delivered 1.64 million NEVs, reflecting robust demand amid China's EV transition. The company's mission emphasizes sustainable mobility, with innovations in ultra-fast charging and off-road EVs positioning it for long-term dominance in the electrification megatrend.

Potential: More OEMs (Ford talks rumored Sept 2024).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy for growth). Rationale: 30%+ sales CAGR potential from exports/tech; undervalued at 14x FY25E P/E vs. peers; moderate risk from tariffs offset by diversification. Hold/sell if China demand softens.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: HK$280 (~20% upside from current). Based on 20x FY25E EPS (CNY 14.0, per H1 guidance/analyst consensus), DCF with 12% growth to 2028, 10% WACC. Targets strong growth (exports 50% CAGR) with moderate risk (China 70% revenue). *Sources: Bloomberg consensus Oct 2024.*",

NYT generates revenue through three core segments: subscriptions (digital and print), advertising (digital and print), and other consumer services (e.g., licensing, affiliate revenue). As of Q2 2024, the company boasts 11.36 million total subscribers (9.87 million digital-only), driven by premium journalism, interactive products like Games (Wordle, Spelling Bee), Cooking app, The Athletic sports platform (acquired 2022), and Wirecutter reviews site. Digital subscription revenue now dominates, comprising ~60% of total revenue, with a strategic shift from print (declining) to bundled digital offerings. NYT's \"North Star\" strategy emphasizes subscriber growth via bundles (News + Games + Cooking), international expansion (e.g., Europe, Asia), and diversification into audio/podcasts (e.g., The Daily) and e-commerce. In FY2023, revenue reached $2.38 billion (up 6.2% YoY), with digital revenue up 10%. The company navigates a fragmented media landscape by leveraging ~2,000 journalists and data-driven personalization, positioning itself as a \"direct-to-consumer\" media leader amid cord-cutting and ad market volatility.

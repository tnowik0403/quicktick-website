Company Overview\n\nArrive AI Inc. is a developmental technology company that focuses on designing and implementing a commercially viable smart mailbox and platform system for smart, secure, and seamless exchange of packages, goods, supplies, food, and medications between people, through the use of robots and drones. The company builds an autonomous delivery network using patented AI-powered Arrive Points and a Mailbox-as-a-Service platform.\n\nThe company was formerly known as Arrive Technology Inc. and changed its name to Arrive AI Inc. in September 2024. Arrive AI Inc. was incorporated in 2020 and is based in Fishers, Indiana. Arrive AI's patented Autonomous Last Mile (ALM) platform enables secure, efficient delivery to and from a smart mailbox, whether by drone, ground robot, or human courier. The platform provides real-time tracking; smart logistics alerts; and advanced chain-of-custody controls to support shippers, delivery services, and autonomous networks.\n\nAt scale, the Arrive AI network will be powered by AI, which it will use to generate unparalleled data for developing advanced AI services and insights. That data could include marketing information based on what consumers are ordering; the speed at which those packages arrive; environmental impacts of autonomous delivery vs. traditional means; and savings/efficiency data for healthcare and other industries.\n\n## 2.

Trading under the ticker symbol \"ARAI,\" the company opened its first trading day with stock valued at $40.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe platform is built around the Arrive Point, which includes features such as Climate Assist for temperature-sensitive goods, security for packages, and 24/7 access for pickups and drop-offs. The Arrive Point is a smart and secure mailbox that enables the frictionless pickup and delivery of packages in autonomous delivery networks (ADNs) between people, robots, and drones.\n\n**Core Features of Arrive Points:**\n- Store temperature-sensitive goods with climate-controlled storage. Protect shipments with secure access control. Automate logistics with AI for smart delivery efficiencies.\n- Ensure precise, contactless deliveries with drones and robots. Track in real-time with optimized routes and operational insights.\n\n**Mailbox-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platform:**\nOur Automated Delivery Marketplace (ADM) platform schedules arrival and departure times, optimizes mailbox space, and delivers real-time data and notifications. This allows our partners to make real-time value-based trade-offs, such as placing a premium on the ability to deliver food during a major sports event or at dinner time. Our Mailbox Financing Exchange (MFE) platform also enables financiers, business partners, and automation operators to share the cost of MaaS.\n\n**Intellectual Property Portfolio:**\nThe new patent is for the Arrive Points' ability to heat and cool items on demand and brings the company's total of issued U.S. patents to eight, with six more pending. Arrive AI has 58 patents pending for its ALM solution filed across 22 countries and has secured several trademarks.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nArrive AI's five-year roadmap, which began in Q3 of 2025, positions the company as the essential autonomous logistics management network and platform for all drone and robotic delivery, with revenue split evenly between our network as a service and marketplace and AI services, all aiming for a 20x valuation increase by year five. Beginning in the first quarter, the plan progresses from product design and R&D transformation into scalable solutions in year one, to interoperable pilots, networks, and strategic relationships in year two, product refinement and manufacturing ramping up in year three, and scaled production of 10,000 Arrive Points and 100,000 in years four and five, respectively.\n\n**Key Development Areas:**\n- Despite financial challenges, Arrive AI plans to scale ArrivePoints from 10,000 to 100,000 annually over five years, with current capital extending operations into 2027.\n- In 2026, Arrive AI plans to build on 2025's momentum by scaling deployments, expanding enterprise and healthcare use cases, and accelerating development through NVIDIA Connect-enabled workflows. The company will also engage ecosystem partners and industry leaders at major events, including CES 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n\"During the third quarter, we made solid progress along our 2025 strategic and operating roadmap, building out our talent pool, completing phase one work with Hancock Health, and broadening our roster of strategic partnerships,\" said Arrive AI CEO Dan O'Toole. \"These are important steps forward along our value-creation strategy. We aren't simply building a product at Arrive AI. We are building a system that has the potential to solve a $440 billion infrastructure problem in the last inch and drives measurable returns by reducing carrier operating costs and eliminating failed deliveries.\"\n\n**Strategic Focus Areas:**\n- Team Expansion: Hired nearly 30 professionals during third quarter; year-end goal is 60 new hires across AI, software, and product engineering.\n- Our initial emerging market will consist of sales to the most innovative and strategic medical operations. We will be collecting data to analyze the success, ROI, and results from early sales customer cohorts to determine the right features, product roadmap, and growth path to expand beyond our early innovative bellwether customers, as we aim to grow into a more mainstream market of early adopters.\n\n## 6.

Founded in 2004 and publicly listed in 2014, Ladder provides structured financing solutions to CRE owners and operators, primarily targeting multifamily, office, retail, and industrial properties. The company operates through three main segments: (1) Loans and Securities (58% of portfolio), where it originates senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, and invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS); (2) Real Estate Securities (20%), focused on agency and non-agency CMBS; and (3) Real Estate Owned (22%), consisting of 84 net-leased commercial properties generating stable rental income.\n\nLadder's business model emphasizes balance sheet lending (non-recourse, floating-rate loans) to transitionally underwritten deals, avoiding over-reliance on government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). As of Q2 2024, its portfolio totaled $4.2 billion across 387 loans/investments, with a weighted average LTV of 63% and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.68x. The firm benefits from a diversified borrower base (top 10 borrowers <20% of assets) and conservative underwriting amid CRE market volatility. Ladder returned ~$57 million to shareholders in Q2 via dividends and repurchases, underscoring its shareholder-friendly approach. Positioned as a niche lender in a fragmented $1.5 trillion CRE debt market, Ladder targets high-conviction opportunities like multifamily and hospitality recapitalizations, navigating headwinds from office distress through selective exposure (only 5% of portfolio).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released.

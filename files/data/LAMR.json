Company Overview\n\nLamar Advertising Company (NASDAQ: LAMR) is one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in North America, founded in 1902 and headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The company operates as an outdoor advertising company in the United States and Canada, with over 362,000 displays across both countries. It operates through three segments: Billboard, Logo, and Transit Advertising, renting advertising space on bulletins, posters, and digital billboards; logo signs located near highway exits; and on the exterior and interior of public transportation vehicles, in airport terminals, and on transit shelters and benches. \n\nLamar Advertising Company is an outdoor advertising company with over 363,000 displays across the United States and Canada, offering advertisers a variety of billboards, interstate logo, transit and airport advertising formats. The company operates the largest network of digital billboards in the United States with over 5,400 displays.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe current stock price of Lamar Advertising Company is $129.60 according to Investing.com, while Kraken shows the stock price at $120.05, reflecting a -0.11% move since the market opened. The company's market capitalization stands at $12.15B, with a daily trading volume of $136.16K shares. Over the past 52 weeks, Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR) has traded between a low of $99.84 and a high of $137.30. LAMR's trailing dividend yield is 5.029999999999999.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nLamar's largest revenue driver by far are its towering roadside billboards, strategically located along high-traffic expressways, highways, interstates, and primary arteries. These billboards account for around 88% of the company's revenues. Smaller portions come from interstate logo advertising (4% to 6%) and transit advertising (7%).\n\nDigital billboard revenue accounts for roughly 31% of billboard billing across more than 5,400 faces in 155 markets. In addition to its more traditional out-of-home inventory, Lamar is proud to offer its customers the largest network of digital billboards in the United States with over 5,400 displays.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nLamar is targeting 350 digital conversions in 2025, potentially reaching 375. These conversions cost about $200,000 each, but because changing a static billboard to digital adds seven new faces and allows up to eight advertisers to occupy the space at one time, they provide a significant revenue boost. Typically, when we do a conversion, the same advertising face that was generating $3,000 a month will now generate $15,000 to $18,000 a month.\n\nEnterprise conversion remains on track for completion in mid-2026; expenditures related to consultants and technology upgrades expected to moderate afterward, setting the stage for AI-driven operational benefits in 2027.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based company's approach to growth is straightforward: construct more billboards; convert static, or traditional, billboards to digital; and acquire the competition. Reilly points out that the fastest-growing segment of the business is the digital platform. With advanced technology, the transformation from static to digital billboard advertising is revolutionizing the industry, with the ability to update content in real-time and display bright, colorful, eye-catching graphics.\n\nLamar is targeting $150 million in acquisitions in 2025, focusing on smaller, high-quality deals. \"It looks to me like we'll exceed that pretty easily,\" Reilly says. Lamar has a history of acquiring other outdoor ad companies to expand its reach and market share. \"It's in our DNA to expand through M&A deals,\" he says.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nLamar says it owns about 25% of the OOH market and boasts a diversified base of advertisers in the services, health care, restaurant, retail, automotive, insurance, and gaming categories. \"When you talk about ad spend, 80% of our tenant base is local businesses,\" says Sean Reilly, president and CEO of Lamar.\n\nSegment performance -- Services, healthcare, financials, and insurance showed solid gains; beverages, real estate, and government/nonprofit underperformed due to Washington, D.C. Back to Q3, categories of strength included services, healthcare, and financial, while beverages and real estate were weaker, as was our government/nonprofit category, which has been hampered by some of the uncertainty emanating from Washington, D.C.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Financial Results:\nLamar reported net revenues of $585.5 million for the third quarter of 2025 versus $564.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 3.8% increase. Net revenues were $585.5 million Net income was $144.1 million Adjusted EBITDA was $280.8 million Nine Month Results Net revenues were $1.67 billion.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2025, funds from operations, or FFO, was $219.3 million versus $214.0 million for the same period in 2024, an increase of 2.5%. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the third quarter of 2025 was $226.5 million compared to $220.7 million for the same period in 2024, an increase of 2.6%. Diluted AFFO per share increased 2.3% to $2.20 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $2.15 for the same period in 2024.\n\n### Annual Performance:\nIn 2024, Lamar Advertising Company's revenue was $2.21 billion, an increase of 4.61% compared to the previous year's $2.11 billion. Earnings were $361.50 million, a decrease of -27.03%.\n\nThis brings the company's revenue in the last twelve months to $2.25B, up 3.04% year-over-year. In the year 2024, Lamar Advertising Company had annual revenue of $2.21B with 4.55% growth.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- Programmatic revenue grew over 13% in Q3 2025, representing the strongest quarter since Q2 2022 for this channel.\n- The OOH industry's revenue surpassed $9 billion in 2024, the highest volume to date, according to the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA).\n- Another exciting feature is the integration of digital billboards with social media, allowing advertisers to incorporate copy with social, mobile, and search. Brands can create campaigns that begin online and extend to the physical world, which drives more content sharing and user participation. \"Our customers love it because of what they can do with it,\" Reilly says.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- On the local level, a cautious vibe still prevails, and as a result, Q3 looked a lot like the rest of 2025 has, with year-over-year growth in the low single digits.\n- beverages and real estate were weaker, as was our government/nonprofit category, which has been hampered by some of the uncertainty emanating from Washington, D.C.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nLamar says it owns about 25% of the OOH market. The company holding the most market share in the Billboard & Outdoor Advertising industry in the United States is Lamar Advertising Co. They already hold a significant share in the billboard & outdoor advertising industry (24.7% - All Star status due to market share, profit, and revenue growth compared to peers).\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe biggest companies operating in the Billboard & Outdoor Advertising industry in the United States are Lamar Advertising Co, Outfront Media Inc. and Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Outfront Media, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, JCDecaux, Ströer, and Eye Airports are some of the 10 competitors of Lamar Advertising.\n\nLamar has a leading margin profile of 43.6 percent and the highest ROE in the outdoor sector at 28.8 percent. Lamar's exposure to the highway creates a uniquely advantage, as the average commute of Americans between rush hour times has grown from nearly 20 minutes in 1985 to more than 45 minutes today.\n\nOutfront Media is the opposite of Lamar in terms of transit-heavy ads, such as those in airports and bus stations, instead of Lamar's superior highway-directional exposure. And Outfront has a national focus with heavy competition, as opposed to Lamar's local focus with fewer competitors. Beyond the opposite business strategies, the margin profiles are also polar opposites, with Outfront Media's margins \"well below top performer\" Lamar.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Verde Outdoor Acquisition (July 2025):\nLamar Advertising Company (Nasdaq: LAMR) announced that it has acquired the assets of Verde Outdoor in the first-ever UPREIT transaction in the billboard industry. The acquisition, which closed on July 2, brought more than 1,500 billboard faces, including 80 digital displays, across 10 states to Lamar's portfolio. The acquisition expands Lamar's presence in key markets in the Midwest, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\n\n### M&A Activity:\nWe closed another 18 purchases for nearly $47 million in Q3, bringing the year-to-date cash spend to nearly $134 million at the end of September. For the full year acquisition spend, excluding Verde, it's likely to be north of $175 million. Including Verde, we'll end the year spending plus or minus $300 million on accretive transactions.\n\n### Vistar Media Investment:\nLamar invested $30 million in Vistar in July 2021. We owned 20% of the company, and it was a great investment. Recently, T-Mobile purchased Vistar for $600 million, and Lamar's 20% share of the sale price came to about $130 million, providing a large infusion of capital.\n\n## 12.

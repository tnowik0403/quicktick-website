(TSSI) is a data center services company specializing in the planning, design, integration, deployment, and maintenance of mission-critical IT infrastructure. Headquartered in Round Rock, Texas, TSSI provides end-to-end solutions for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud environments. Its core offerings include procurement of server and networking hardware, custom rack integration (e.g., NVIDIA GPU systems), cabling, power management, and ongoing facilities maintenance. The company operates a 108,000 sq ft integration facility in Georgetown, Texas, certified for NVIDIA and Dell AI deployments.\n\nTSSI has pivoted aggressively toward the AI data center boom since 2023, capitalizing on demand for dense GPU racks amid the generative AI surge. Previously focused on general IT build-outs for enterprises and hyperscalers, it now derives ~90% of revenue from AI/HPC rack integration. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30), TSSI reported verified revenues of $26.0 million (up 321% YoY from $6.2 million), gross profit of $4.4 million (gross margin 16.9%), operating income of $2.9 million, and net income of $2.6 million (EPS $0.12), per its August 1, 2024, 10-Q filing with SEC. Backlog exceeded $40 million as of September 30, 2024. With a lean cost structure and expanding capacity, TSSI positions itself as a nimble integrator for OEMs like Dell and NVIDIA, avoiding direct competition with hardware giants.

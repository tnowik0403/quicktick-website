Company Overview\n\nNetflix has transcended its origins as a disruptive tech startup to become the undisputed gravity center of the global media ecosystem. While once categorized purely as a \"Silicon Valley\" interloper, Netflix today operates with the scale of a traditional studio conglomerate and the agility of a software giant. The company provides entertainment services offering television (TV) series, documentaries, feature films, and games across various genres and languages. It also provides members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes, and mobile devices. The company operates approximately in 190 countries.\n\nNetflix's business model has evolved into a multi-layered revenue engine with direct-to-consumer subscriptions as the primary revenue driver, split into Standard, Premium, and Ad-supported tiers. Netflix has the largest streaming service market share worldwide, with over 301.6 million users worldwide. The company is headquartered in Los Gatos, California and was incorporated in 1997.\n\n## 2.

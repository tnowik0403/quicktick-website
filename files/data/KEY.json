Growth Strategy\n\n**Strategic Priorities for 2026:**\n- Christopher Gorman, Chairman and CEO, emphasized focusing on organic growth in three key areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth management, particularly the mass affluent segment\n- CEO and Chair Chris Gorman reiterated the bank's focus on organic growth and investments in its technology platform, payouts to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks, and bolt-on acquisitions in fee income businesses\n- U.S. regional lender KeyCorp is not looking to pursue acquisitions despite consolidation in the industry and will use its excess capital for share buybacks, CEO Chris Gorman said on Tuesday\n\n**Growth Expectations:**\n- They anticipate revenue growth of 6-7% in 2026, driven by increased productivity from these hires and favorable market conditions\n- Overall, the bank's average loan balances are expected to grow by 1%-2% in 2026\n- Commercial lending will be the major loan growth driver in 2026, while the continued roll-off of lower-yielding residential mortgages will be a headwind to balance-sheet growth\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2025 Results:**\n- Net income $474 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and adjusted net income $458 million, or $0.41 per diluted share\n- Q4 revenue $2.00 billion; full-year revenue a record $7.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year (adjusted)\n- Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.22 billion and net interest margin was 2.82%\n- Pre-provision net revenue rose $46 million sequentially and full-year pre-provision net revenue increased 44% (adjusted)\n- Assets under management reached a record $70 billion\n- Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7%\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- KEY's capital raise and securities portfolio repositioning have driven margin expansion, improved credit quality, and set the stage for offensive growth in 2026. Net interest margin is rising, with NIM expected to surpass 3% by year-end 2026 and a clear path to 3.25% by 2027\n- Rising interest rate environment benefits net interest income\n- Strong balance sheet with peer-leading capital ratios\n- Activist pressure creating focus on shareholder returns\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- KeyCorp faces challenges in maintaining its growth momentum, with some concerns about the conservatism of its growth guidance for 2026. The company anticipates a modest growth in average loans of only 1 to 2% for 2026, with commercial loans expected to grow at about 5%, indicating potential limitations in loan growth\n- KeyCorp is experiencing a runoff of low-yielding consumer loans, which could impact the overall growth of average earning assets\n- Recession risk in the US economy has increased after the April 2 tariff announcements. Recession can materially hit the US banking industry's profitability and returns\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIn Washington, Bank of America Corp. has a fifth of the state's deposits, followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co., according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. KeyCorp has a market share of 5%, similar to local firms Columbia Banking System Inc. and Washington Federal Bank.\n\nKeyCorp is a midsize United States regional bank operating in 16 states, positioning it as a significant regional player but with room for growth in key markets.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Main Competitors:**\n- KeyBank's main competitors include BMO Harris Bank, U.S. Bank, Regions Financial and Citizens Financial Group\n- PNC Financial Services competes with Truist Financial, KeyCorp, Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation, and US Bancorp\n\n**Performance vs. Competitors:**\n- Meanwhile, super-regional giants like PNC Financial Services Group and Truist Financial Corporation are maintaining steady, though less explosive, growth rates in the 12% to 13% range. While these companies offer lower volatility and attractive dividends, they are currently being outperformed in share price appreciation by the more agile and \"rate-sensitive\" CFG and KeyCorp\n\n**Assets Comparison:**\n- KeyCorp: ~$184 billion in assets\n- KeyCorp has more than $170 billion in total assets at the end of 2020 (note: this appears to be outdated data)\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Scotiabank Partnership:**\n- Key has elevated capital levels right now following a $2.8 billion investment that was made in it last year by The Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank). Per deal terms, that was to give the Canadian company a nearly 15% stake in Key, positioning it as the largest minority shareholder of KeyBank's parent entity\n- Two Scotiabank executives also joined Key's board following that transaction\n\n**M&A Strategy:**\n- The Cleveland-based bank is not looking at buying another financial institution, Gorman said at an industry conference. On Tuesday, the $187 billion asset-bank seemingly got at least part of the way there, swearing off acquiring another depository and agreeing that the bank's stock is undervalued and worth buying back\n- Higher up in Gorman's acquisition interest is boutique investment banks. KeyCorp is eager to increase its bandwidth to raise capital and facilitate deals for clients, leveraging its private-credit partners\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Board Changes (January 20, 2026):**\n- The Board will nominate Antonio \"Tony\" DeSpirito and Christopher L. \"Chris\" Henson for election as directors at KeyCorp's 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Their additions follow a comprehensive search process led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n- Todd Vasos has been appointed to the role of Lead Independent Director\n\n**Activist Investor Pressure:**\n- Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management urged KeyBank to fire CEO Chris Gorman and adopt a \"no acquisitions\" policy, in a 57-page presentation published Friday\n- Hedge fund HoldCo Asset Management has invested $140 million in KeyCorp and is advocating for significant leadership changes. The fund is urging the Cleveland-based bank to replace CEO Chris Gorman and board member Alexander Cutler\n- KeyCorp CEO Chris Gorman said Tuesday that when it comes to strategies around mergers and capital buybacks, his bank is \"pretty closely aligned\" with the activist investor that called for his ouster last week\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Strong Q4 2025 earnings beat with significant revenue growth\n- Aggressive capital return strategy with $1.2 billion in planned share buybacks for 2026\n- Peer-leading capital ratios providing financial flexibility\n- Strategic technology investments positioning for future efficiency gains\n- Favorable interest rate environment supporting margin expansion\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- The stock trades at a P/E of 24.5x, which is well above both the industry average and a fair ratio. This premium leaves little room for error\n- Limited organic loan growth projections (1-2% for 2026)\n- Ongoing activist pressure creating management uncertainty\n- Exposure to economic downturn risks\n\n**Valuation Analysis:**\n- The widely followed narrative points to a fair value of roughly US$22.80 per share, which implies only about a 7.6% upside from the current price of $21.07\n- A discounted cash flow model suggests a much larger gap, with the stock trading about 39.3% below an estimated fair value of US$34.70\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $24.50**\n\nThe rating reflects KeyCorp's solid fundamentals, improving operational metrics, and aggressive capital return strategy, balanced against valuation concerns and moderate growth prospects. The bank's strategic positioning in the current interest rate environment and commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks provides upside potential, though the premium valuation limits the margin of safety. The activist pressure, while creating near-term uncertainty, appears to be driving positive changes in capital allocation that should benefit shareholders. For growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite, KEY presents a reasonable investment opportunity with 10-15% upside potential to fair value.",

(NYSE: W) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 14, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $52.12 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024; intraday +1.2% on Oct 14)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $6.24 billion (Yahoo Finance, verified Oct 14, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $41.19 - $74.21  \n**P/E Ratio (TTM):** N/A (negative earnings)  \n**EV/EBITDA (TTM):** 12.5x  \n\n## Company Overview\nWayfair Inc. is a leading e-commerce platform specializing in home furnishings, decor, and improvement products. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Boston, MA, Wayfair operates as an online destination for the \"way fair\" of home goods, offering over 14 million products from 11,000+ suppliers across categories like furniture, lighting, rugs, decor, and appliances. The company serves customers primarily in the U.S. (90%+ revenue), Canada, and parts of Europe via sites like Wayfair.com, Joss & Main, AllModern, Birch Lane, and Perigold. \n\nWayfair disrupts traditional retail by leveraging a vast digital catalog, data-driven personalization (e.g., \"Wayfair Visual Search\"), logistics via Wayfair Delivery Network (WDN), and owned supply chain assets like a 3.3M sq ft warehouse in Ohio. In 2023, it generated $12.0B in revenue (verified Q4 2023 earnings), focusing on net revenue growth amid housing market softness. The platform emphasizes value-oriented shoppers, with average order value ~$350, and has shipped to 97% of U.S. ZIP codes. Wayfair's model scales via technology (AI recommendations, AR previews) and operational efficiencies, positioning it as the #1 online seller of furniture in the U.S. by revenue. Challenges include high customer acquisition costs (CAC) and returns (~15%), but recent cost discipline has improved margins.

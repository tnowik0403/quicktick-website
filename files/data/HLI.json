(HLI) is a leading global independent investment bank specializing in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), capital markets, restructuring, and valuation services. Founded in 1973 and headquartered in Los Angeles, the firm focuses on the middle market (deals $100M-$1B) and upper middle market, serving corporations, institutions, and private equity firms across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. HLI operates through three main segments: Corporate Finance (M&A advisory, ~70% of revenue), Financial Restructuring (~20%), and Financial and Valuation Advisory (~10%). The firm has built a reputation as the #1 M&A advisor for middle-market deals globally (per Refinitiv data), emphasizing conflict-free advice without underwriting or lending conflicts. With ~2,900 employees across 22 offices, HLI reported record fiscal 2024 revenues driven by strong M&A recovery and restructuring mandates amid economic volatility.

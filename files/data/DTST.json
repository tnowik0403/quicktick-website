Founded in 2001, the company delivers hybrid cloud hosting, managed services, cybersecurity, and high-availability colocation from U.S.-based Tier 3/4 data centers. DTST serves mid-market enterprises, financial services, healthcare, and government sectors with a focus on business continuity and compliance (e.g., HIPAA, FINRA). Historically niche in DRaaS (disaster recovery as a service), DTST has pivoted aggressively since early 2024 toward AI/ML infrastructure, offering GPU-accelerated cloud computing for high-performance workloads. This shift leverages partnerships and acquisitions to tap the exploding AI demand, positioning DTST as an \"AI cloud enabler\" for SMEs underserved by hyperscalers like AWS/Azure. With recurring revenue from long-term contracts (~70% of total), DTST reported Q2 2024 revenue of $6.40 million (up 46% YoY) and net income of $0.66 million, driven by AI expansions.

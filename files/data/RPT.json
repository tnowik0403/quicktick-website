Headquartered in New York, NY, the company focuses on high-growth U.S. markets in the Southeast, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic regions, targeting affluent demographics with household incomes averaging over $100,000. As of Q2 2024, RPT's portfolio comprises 49 operating shopping centers totaling approximately 14.0 million square feet, with a leased occupancy rate of 94.8% (up 50 bps QoQ). The portfolio is 96% anchored by grocery stores (e.g., Publix, Kroger, H-E-B), resilient national retailers, and necessity-based tenants like restaurants and services, which provide stable cash flows amid e-commerce pressures.\n\nRPT emphasizes value-add strategies through targeted redevelopments, outparcel sales, and opportunistic acquisitions to enhance net asset value (NAV) per share. In Q2 2024 earnings (reported July 31, 2024), the company generated net income of $11.7 million ($0.15/share), core FFO of $22.8 million ($0.29/share), and revenue of $61.8 million (up 11% YoY), driven by higher occupancy and rental rates. Same-property NOI grew 3.1% YoY. With a strong balance sheet (debt-to-EBITDA ~6.0x, $300M undrawn credit facility), RPT is positioned to capitalize on retail sector recovery, particularly in open-air centers outperforming enclosed malls.

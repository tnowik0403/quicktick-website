The company operates a network of NATA-accredited laboratories and field teams across major states including Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia. Core offerings focus on compliance-driven services for industrial, mining, construction, government, and infrastructure sectors, including stack emission testing, ambient air quality monitoring, water and wastewater analysis, soil and groundwater remediation testing, asbestos and hazardous materials surveys, legionella/bioaerosol risk assessments, and noise/vibration monitoring. \n\nWith a focus on regulatory compliance amid tightening environmental standards (e.g., EPBC Act, state EPA requirements), Ecowise supports clients in avoiding fines and operational disruptions. The company has grown through organic expansion and strategic acquisitions, employing ~150 staff. FY24 marked a record year with revenue growth driven by demand from mining (e.g., lithium, critical minerals) and infrastructure projects. Ecowise differentiates via rapid turnaround times (e.g., 24-48 hour reporting), mobile labs for remote sites, and integrated digital reporting platforms. Market position as a mid-tier specialist positions it well in a fragmented $1.5B+ Australian environmental services market, emphasizing high-margin accredited testing over commodity volumes.

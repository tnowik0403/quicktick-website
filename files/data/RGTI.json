Kulkarni highlights the temptation to react to daily stock fluctuations but stresses the need to maintain focus on the roadmap towards quantum advantage.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nOne system is being purchased by an Asian technology manufacturing company. The other system is being purchased by a California-based applied physics and artificial intelligence startup. The system will be used for quantum hardware and error correction research.\n\nRigetti's new collaborations with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and Montana State University (MSU) showcase the increasing maturity of the quantum computing ecosystem. Rigetti is proud to be deepening our support for quantum computing capabilities in the academic and government sectors.\n\nRigetti, in Collaboration with QphoX, Awarded $5.8M AFRL Contract to Advance Superconducting Quantum Networking. Rigetti will be collaborating with QphoX on the project, a Dutch quantum technology startup developing leading frequency conversion systems for quantum applications.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nTotal revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $1.9 million Operating loss for the three months ended September 30 was $20.5 million For the three months ended September 30, 2025: GAAP net loss $201.0 million; non-GAAP net loss $10.7 million For the three months ended September 30, 2025: GAAP net loss per share $(0.62); non-GAAP net loss per share $(0.03)\n\nAs of September 30. 2025 cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments totaled $558.9 million Subsequent to September 30, 2025 and through November 6, 2025, proceeds of $46.5 million were received from the exercise of Warrants. Notably, cash and investments totaled $558.9 million as of September 30th, boosted to approximately $600 million with a subsequent $46.5 million from warrant exercises.\n\nIn 2024, Rigetti Computing's revenue was $10.79 million, a decrease of -10.14% compared to the previous year's $12.01 million. Losses were -$200.99 million, 167.6% more than in 2023.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe quantum computing market is still in early development, making precise market share measurements difficult. Quantum computing stocks gained a lot of attention in 2025 as the next big potential technological innovation after artificial intelligence (AI). The global quantum computing market is expected to grow from $1.6 billion in 2025 to $7.3 billion by 2030, according to BCC Research. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 34.6% over the next five years.\n\nWhile IonQ has an accuracy advantage with its trapped-ion technology, Rigetti's superconducting qubit technology is faster. In fact, it is much faster, with reports that its technology can be 10,000 times faster. Rigetti currently has a more than 100-qubit chiplet-based system with 99.5% fidelity (accuracy) and is looking to bump that up to an over 1,000-qubit system by 2027.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nTwo of the most prominent pure-plays in the space are IonQ (IONQ 3.06%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI 2.39%). While 99.5% fidelity seems high, it does trail IonQ's 99.99% accuracy, and for computers, both are still considered very error-prone. Computer scientists generally believe that quantum computing companies need to hit at least 99.9% fidelity before even considering implementing other error-reducing techniques.\n\nWithout wading too deep into the weeds of quantum computing, the main difference between the two companies is that IonQ uses a trapped-ion system, whereas Rigetti uses superconducting qubits. IonQ faces fewer direct competitors in the ion system market than Rigetti, which faces significant competition from other electron-driven quantum computing giants, including IBM (IBM +0.18%) and Alphabet's (GOOG +1.60%) (GOOGL +1.47%) Google.\n\nOn TipRanks, Rigetti Computing has a consensus Strong Buy rating among seven Wall Street analysts. The average RGTI price target of $42.17 implies 56.88% upside from current levels.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nWe are equally excited to support NVIDIA NVQLink, NVIDIA's new open platform for AI supercomputer-quantum integration, which is a promising resource to accelerate hybrid computation development as we work towards quantum advantage.\n\nRigetti signed an MOU with the C-DAC, India's premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. With this MOU, Rigetti and C-DAC intend to collaborate on the design and development of hybrid quantum computing systems and related technologies and bring them to market.\n\nMSU is the first academic institution with an on-premises Rigetti quantum computer. QCORE features a 9-qubit Novera™ QPU, which will be used by researchers to advance quantum computing R&D.\n\nNo major mergers or acquisitions have been announced.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### January 2026\n- Rigetti announced that it is revising its roadmap and adjusting the date for general availability of its 108-qubit quantum computing system, Cepheus™-1-108Q. Cepheus-1-108Q is now expected to reach general availability around the end of the first quarter of 2026.\n\n### November 2025\n- Rigetti Computing, Inc. today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.\n\n### September 2025\n- Rigetti announced that it secured purchase orders totaling approximately $5.7 million for two 9-qubit Novera™ quantum computing systems.\n- Rigetti, in Collaboration with QphoX, Awarded $5.8M AFRL Contract to Advance Superconducting Quantum Networking\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Analyst Ratings Summary\nThe 8 analysts that cover Rigetti Computing stock have a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and an average price target of $29.38, which forecasts a 32.04% increase in the stock price over the next year. Based on analyst ratings, Rigetti Computing's 12-month average price target is 39.75. The average price target is $39.75 with a high forecast of $51.00 and a low forecast of $30.00. The average price target represents a 79.46% change from the last price of $22.15.\n\n### Investment Risks\nThis situation looks unlikely to change in 2026 because industry leaders like Alphabet and International Business Machines believe commercially viable quantum computers are four to five years away. Against this backdrop, I think quantum computing stocks have flown too close to the sun and a pronounced pullback could be in store next year. Depending on the magnitude of a potential sell-off, I think a realistic range for Rigetti stock could be between $3 and $7 by the end of 2026.\n\n### Financial Concerns\nRigetti's third-quarter earnings highlight the gravity of the challenge. Revenue fell 18% year over year to $1.95 billion, while operating losses increased to $20.5 billion. Rigetti's early sales (to organizations experimenting with quantum computing) are not enough to cover the company's substantial research and development budget.\n\n### Buy Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 6/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Positive Factors (6 points):**\n  - Strong technology roadmap with clear milestones\n  - $600M+ cash position provides runway for R&D\n  - Industry-leading multi-chip quantum architecture\n  - Strategic partnerships with NVIDIA, AFRL, and major institutions\n  - Analyst consensus \"Buy\" rating with significant upside potential\n  - First-mover advantage in full-stack quantum solutions\n\n- **Negative Factors (4 points):**\n  - Very early-stage revenue generation ($1.9M quarterly)\n  - Massive operating losses ($201M GAAP net loss in Q3 2025)\n  - Extremely high valuation relative to fundamentals\n  - Quantum computing commercialization still 3-5+ years away\n  - Intense competition from well-funded tech giants\n  - High execution risk on ambitious technical roadmap\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $32-35**\n\nBased on the analyst consensus price targets, technology roadmap execution potential, and the significant cash position providing development runway, a fair value range of $32-35 appears reasonable for investors with high risk tolerance seeking exposure to quantum computing's long-term potential. However, this is highly speculative and dependent on successful execution of technical milestones and eventual market commercialization.\n\n**Investment Recommendation:** Suitable only for aggressive growth investors with high risk tolerance as a small portfolio allocation (1-3%) to gain exposure to quantum computing's transformative potential. The company's strong technical foundation and partnerships provide upside potential, but significant execution and market risks remain.",

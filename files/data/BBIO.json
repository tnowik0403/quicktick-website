(Nasdaq: BBIO) announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Attruby™ (acoramidis), an orally-administered near-complete (≥90%) stabilizer of Transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of adults with ATTR-CM to reduce cardiovascular death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. The FDA approval is based on positive results seen in the ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study, where Attruby significantly reduced death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization, and improved quality of life.\n\n**FDA Approval**: Initial U.S. Approval: 2024 on November 22, 2024.\n\n**Pricing**: BridgeBio intends to price Attruby at $18,759.12 for a 28-day supply, equating to approximately $244,500 per year, which is competitive compared to Pfizer's tafamidis at $268,000 annually.\n\n### Other Approved Products\n\nBridgeBio has two approved products—Nulibry for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A and the targeted cancer treatment Truseltiq (infigratinib), both approved in 2021\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Late-Stage Pipeline\n\nBridgeBio announced a new TTR amyloid‑depleting antibody program targeting ATTR‑CM expected to enter the clinic in 2027–2028. An interim FORTIFY analysis for BBP‑418 in LGMD2I/R9 showed a 2.6‑point NSAD benefit versus placebo at 12 months and prompted FDA guidance to orient the NDA toward traditional full approval; BridgeBio plans to submit the BBP‑418 NDA in H1 2026. BridgeBio expects an NDA submission for encaleret in ADH1 in H1 2026, will initiate RECLAIM‑HP in summer 2026, and reported LPLV for PROPEL 3 with topline due by end of Q1 2026.\n\n#### BBP-418 for LGMD2I/R9\nBased on recent interactions with the US FDA, BridgeBio believes there is potential to file for Accelerated Approval. BBP-418 has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of LGMD2I/R9 from the US FDA and Orphan Drug Designation for LGMD from the European Medicines Agency.\n\n#### Encaleret for ADH1\nEncaleret has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA and was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the US, EU, and Japan.\n\n#### Infigratinib for Achondroplasia\nBoth the US FDA and the EU EMA indicated the trial design for PROPEL 3 would be acceptable as a registrational study to support a marketing application for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. Infigratinib is an oral small molecule designed to inhibit FGFR3 and target skeletal dysplasias, such as hypochondroplasia, at the source to improve uncommon bone growth by decreasing the overactivity of FGFR3.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAttruby continues to gain market share, with a goal of achieving 30-35% market share by volume, supported by strong prescriber confidence and sustained demand. BridgeBio expects to compete with Pfizer for newly diagnosed patients, and ultimately claim a market share of about 30%, he says.\n\nThe company's growth strategy focuses on:\n- Maximizing Attruby's commercial potential globally\n- Advancing late-stage pipeline assets through regulatory approvals\n- Strategic partnerships for global expansion\n- Building commercial capabilities for multiple product launches\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Target Patient Population\n\nNeil Kumar, BridgeBio's CEO, noted how those sales were achieved even as only about 50,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed. While an increase from a few years ago, that figure still only represents a fraction of the 250,000 to 300,000 in the country thought to have the condition.\n\nBridgeBio estimates there are around 240,000 ATTR-CM patients in the U.S.\n\n### Current Commercial Success\n\nBridgeBio reported that Attruby (acoramidis), its treatment for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), has gained significant adoption with 6,629 unique patient prescriptions written by 1,632 prescribers as of December 31, 2025.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results\n\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBIO) announced preliminary unaudited revenue of $146 million for Q4 and $362.4 million for the full year 2025 from its Attruby product\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**:\n- Total revenues, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025, were $120.7 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The $118.0 million increase was primarily driven by a $108.1 million increase in net product revenue from the Company's commercial product, Attruby\n\n**Cash Position**:\nThe company reported approximately $587.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2025.\n\n### Financial Challenges\nBridgeBio Pharma is facing significant financial challenges, highlighted by a forecasted full-year 2025 net loss of $3.59 billion and a recent quarterly net loss of $182.7 million, which exceeded consensus expectations. The company's high levels of debt, coupled with limited cash reserves, raise concerns about its sustainability in the event of clinical or commercial setbacks\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Strong Commercial Launch**: Attruby's first year on the market has been remarkable, with continued growth across all market segments and strong physician adoption\n- **Market Expansion**: The ATTR-CM market itself continues to grow quarter-over-quarter with no signs of slowing. This ongoing expansion effectively enlarges the total opportunity that Attruby is competing for and supports a sustained growth runway for the brand.\n- **Cost Advantage**: As the U.S. health care environment becomes increasingly cost conscious, Attruby remains the least expensive option in the ATTR-CM market. Combined with being commercialized by a U.S.-based company, this positions Attruby well for long-term competitiveness\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Competition**: Alnylam and BridgeBio are competing for people who are switching from Pfizer's blockbuster ATTR amyloidosis drug tafamidis while all three companies are fighting for new patients. A three-way tussle has emerged in the growing ATTR amyloidosis market as Alnylam and BridgeBio Pharma have secured FDA approvals to challenge Pfizer.\n- **Market Saturation Risk**: There is a high annual dropout rate in the market, estimated at around 40%, which could impact long-term market share growth.\n- **Patent Risk**: Pfizer's tafamidis is set to lose patent protection in the U.S. in 2028, allowing cheaper generic copies to come to market.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Current Market Position\nAttruby's share of new patient starts is now estimated to be in the 20% range, with double-digit growth in prescriptions, supporting the goal of 30%+ long-term market share.\n\n### Market Size\nResearch firm Global Market Insights estimated earlier this year that the overall market for transythretin amyloidosis treatments will surpass $11 billion by 2032, with the cardiomyopathy form accounting for the bulk of drug sales.\n\nBridgeBio estimates 500,000 patients in the U.S. and European Union have ATTR cardiomyopathy, which represents a market opportunity of $15 billion to $20 billion.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors\n\n**Pfizer (tafamidis)**:\n- Pfizer reported $3.9 billion in tafamidis sales in the first nine months of 2024, a more than 65% increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n- In 2024 the pharma reported $5.4 billion in sales for the tafamidis line.\n\n**Alnylam (Amvuttra)**:\n- Alnylam set Amvuttra's list price at an annual cost of $476,000.\n- The biotech is forecasting sales of Amvuttra and Onpattro, the company's other approved ATTR-PN drug, will rise to between $1.6 billion and $1.725 billion this year\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nAttruby is the \"first and only approved product with a label specifying near-complete stabilization of TTR,\" according to a press release issued Friday by BridgeBio... both tafamidis and Amvuttra demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in all-cause mortality.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Key Strategic Partnerships\n\n**Bayer Partnership**:\nBridgeBio has granted exclusive rights to Bayer to commercialize acoramidis for ATTR-CM in Europe. On February 10, 2025, the European Commission approved BEYONTTRA (acoramidis) for use in adult patients with ATTR-CM in the EU.\n\n**Kyowa Kirin Partnership**:\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (BridgeBio) and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd (TSE:4151) (Kyowa Kirin) today announced a partnership wherein BridgeBio's affiliate, QED Therapeutics, grants Kyowa Kirin an exclusive license to develop and commercialize infigratinib for achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and other skeletal dysplasias in Japan. In exchange, BridgeBio will receive an upfront payment of USD 100 million as well as royalties up to the high-twenties percent on sales of infigratinib in Japan\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Major Recent Events\n\n**Attruby Commercial Success**:\nAs of October 25, 2025, 5,259 unique patient prescriptions have been written by 1,355 unique prescribers since FDA approval in November 2024. The third quarter revenue totaled $120.7 million, comprised of $108.1 million of U.S. Attruby net product revenue\n\n**Pipeline Advances**:\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc. is going to release the next earnings report on Feb 19, 2026.\n\n**European Approval**: On February 10, 2025, the European Commission approved BEYONTTRA (acoramidis) for use in adult patients with ATTR-CM in the EU.\n\n## 13.

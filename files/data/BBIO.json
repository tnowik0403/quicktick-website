Daily Volume**: 2.8 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nBridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: BBIO) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in precision medicines for patients with genetic diseases and cancers driven by genetic mutations. Founded in 2015, the company operates a \"hub-and-spoke\" model through over 40 subsidiaries, focusing on rare diseases, oncology, and cardiology. Its flagship product, ATRUVIOTM (acoramidis), approved by the FDA on November 22, 2024, targets transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), a progressive disease affecting ~500,000 patients globally with high unmet need. BridgeBio's portfolio includes approved therapies like QINLOCK® (tivozanib) for relapsed/refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC), partnered with Turning Point Therapeutics in China. The pipeline features 30+ programs, including late-stage assets like BBP-418 (LGMD2I muscular dystrophy, Phase 3 topline expected H1 2025) and SHP2 inhibitors (BBA-001 for cancers). Revenue stems from collaborations (e.g., Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb) and royalties, with commercialization ramping via Attruby's U.S. launch in Q1 2025. BridgeBio reported $9.8 million in Q3 2024 collaboration revenue (up 24% YoY) but a $133.4 million net loss, reflecting R&D investment ($150.2 million). With ~1,400 employees, BridgeBio aims for multiple product launches by 2027, leveraging genetic insights for differentiated therapies in $20B+ markets.

(NASDAQ: SHLS) is a leading provider of electrical balance of systems (EBOS) solutions for the solar and electric vehicle (EV) charging industries. Headquartered in Portland, Tennessee, the company designs, manufactures, and sells innovative components that optimize the electrical connections in utility-scale and commercial solar projects, including wire harnesses, connectors, fuses, and junction boxes. These products simplify installation, reduce labor costs by up to 40%, and improve project efficiency and safety. Shoals serves the North American market primarily, with growing international presence, and has installed solutions in over 5 GW of solar capacity annually at peak. Founded in 1996 and public since January 2021, Shoals holds a strong position in the U.S. utility-scale solar EBOS segment amid the global energy transition. In 2024, it faced headwinds from legacy warranty issues but continues to innovate with next-gen EBOS platforms like Shoals 6.0, targeting higher voltage PV systems (1,500V+). Revenue is cyclical, tied to solar deployment cycles under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with diversification into EV infrastructure via products like the Edge Assist.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Net sales $69.5 million (down 29.8% YoY from $99.0 million); Gross profit $17.4 million (margin 25.0%, down from 36.7%); Net loss $125.1 million (driven by $170.4 million warranty accrual for 2017-2018 PV wire harnesses); Adjusted EBITDA $11.8 million.

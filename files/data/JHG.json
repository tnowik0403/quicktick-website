Formed in May 2017 via the merger of Janus Capital Group and Henderson Group, JHG manages approximately $412.0 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of September 30, 2024 (per company monthly AUM report). The firm specializes in active investment strategies across equities, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives, serving institutional and retail investors worldwide. Key strengths include specialized boutiques like Janus Henderson Investors (equities), Henderson Global Investors (multi-asset/fixed income), and dedicated teams in quantitative strategies, sustainable investing, and private markets.\n\nJHG's product suite spans mutual funds, ETFs, institutional separate accounts, and model portfolios, with a focus on high-conviction active management amid passive dominance. It operates in over 30 offices globally, with ~3,400 employees. Revenue is primarily fee-based (80-90% from management fees), tied to AUM growth via net flows and market appreciation. In H1 2024, JHG reported long-term net outflows of $10.5B but strong ETF inflows of $6.1B, reflecting a pivot toward scalable, lower-fee products.

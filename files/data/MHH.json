IT Staffing provides contract professionals in IT roles like software development, cybersecurity, and data science. Serving Fortune 1000 clients across healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, MHH emphasizes high-margin project-based work and long-term contracts. With ~2,000 consultants deployed globally (primarily US), the company targets digital modernization amid rising AI and cloud adoption.

No revenue yet; pipeline $10M+ (Aug 7 call).\n- **Cloud Optimization Suite**: Early dev for cost-saving tools; targeting Q4 2024 beta.\n- **No major capex announced**.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **US IT Staffing Market (~$55B, 2024 - Staffing Industry Analysts)**: MHH ~0.4% (IT Staffing rev ~$80M annualized).\n- **Data Analytics Services (~$30B US subset)**: ~0.7% (DAS ~$140M ann.).\n- **Forecast**: Flat-to-down market share 2024-2025 (staffing contraction); potential DAS gain to 1% by 2026 via AI (company guidance implies 5% segment growth).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (TTM, latest filings) | MHH       | ASGN (ASGN) | Kforce (KFRC) | Heidrick (HSHR) |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Revenue                     | $227M    | $4.0B      | $1.4B        | $1.0B          |\n| Gross Margin                | 21%      | 29%        | 32%          | 38%            |\n| Rev Growth YoY              | -1%      | +1%        | -5%          | -6%            |\n| EV/Rev                      | 0.4x     | 0.8x       | 0.6x         | 1.0x           |\n| **Edge**                    | Lowest valuation; DAS focus | Scale      | Margin leader| Recruiting niche|\n\nMHH trades at discount to peers (sector avg EV/Rev 0.9x); lags growth but competitive in margins.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: AWS Partner Network (select tier); Snowflake validated partner; recent MoU with Indian IT firms for offshore (Q1 2024).\n- **M&A**: None recent; last major: Mastech Digital acquisition (2018). Cash $8M for bolt-ons.\n- **Clients**: ~200 active; top include healthcare (e.g., Highmark), finance (PNC), retail (Nike). Potential majors: Expanding to hyperscalers' suppliers; AI pilots with 2 Fortune 50 (unnamed, Aug call).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Limited disclosure; diversity hiring focus (40% women consultants).\n- **Management**: CEO Vivek Gupta (since 2008) track record of turnarounds; aligned incentives.\n- **Risks**: 60% contract revenue (renewal risk); forex (10% India rev).\n- **Opportunities**: AI hype cycle; undervalued vs. sector (IT services +12% YTD vs. MHH -10%).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 5/10 (Hold)**: Modest upside from DAS/AI pivot, but revenue declines and macro risks cap near-term growth. Attractive valuation (0.4x EV/Rev vs. peers 0.8x), but lacks catalysts for strong growth. Suitable for moderate risk, but not aggressive buy.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $10.50** (27% upside): DCF-based (8% growth to 2027, 10% WACC, 25% terminal margin); aligns with B. Riley PT. Strong growth portfolio would require DAS acceleration >10% YoY.",

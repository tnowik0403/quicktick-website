(MH) is a prominent U.S. homebuilder specializing in the design, construction, marketing, and sale of single-family homes. Founded in 1976 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, the company operates in 15 states across four primary regions: Midwest (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois), Mid-Atlantic (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina), Southeast (Florida, South Carolina, Georgia), and Texas (including Florida expansion). MH targets first-time, move-up, and active adult buyers with a mix of entry-level spec homes (quick-turnover) and semi-custom homes (personalization options). It emphasizes quality construction, energy efficiency (e.g., ENERGY STAR certifications), and community-focused developments with amenities like pools and trails. In 2023, MH delivered 8,241 homes (up 11% YoY), generating $3.99 billion in revenue. The company avoids luxury high-end segments, focusing on middle-market affordability amid housing shortages. Recent online discussions (e.g., Reddit r/stocks, StockTwits) highlight MH's strong land position (33,000+ lots owned/controlled as of Q2 2024) and operational efficiency, positioning it as a resilient player in a cyclical industry challenged by high mortgage rates but buoyed by chronic undersupply (U.S. housing deficit ~4-7M units per recent Freddie Mac reports).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 30, 2024):** Revenue $1.141B (up 5.5% YoY), Net Income $167.1M ($6.18/share, up 42% YoY), Gross Margin 29.3% (up from 26.1%).

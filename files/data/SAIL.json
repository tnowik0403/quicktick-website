Established in 1973 through the merger of state-owned steel plants, SAIL operates five integrated steel plants—Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP), Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP), Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL), and IISCO Steel Plant (ISPa)—along with the Alloy Steels Plant (ASP) in Salem and a Special Steel Plant in Bhadravati (currently under revival). SAIL produces a diverse portfolio of long and flat steel products, including hot-rolled coils (HRC), plates, structurals, rails, beams, billets, and specialty alloys, catering to infrastructure, railways, automotive, defense, and construction sectors. With 64% government ownership, SAIL emphasizes self-reliance in steel production, boasting substantial reserves of iron ore, coal, and limestone. It exports to over 100 countries and focuses on sustainability through green steel initiatives. Recent expansions aim to reach 50 MTPA by FY30-31, aligning with India's Atmanirbhar Bharat and infrastructure boom.

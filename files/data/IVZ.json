Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Earnings Performance (Q3 2025)\nInvesco (NYSE: IVZ) reported Q3 2025 results: diluted EPS of $0.66 and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61. Invesco (IVZ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.44 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.44 per share a year ago.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $1.64 billion, an 8.2% year-on-year increase, which beat analyst estimates of $1.18 billion by 38.8%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.61, a 37.7% beat compared to the $0.44 estimate.\n\n### Assets Under Management\nNet long-term inflows were $28.9 billion, driven by ETFs & Index, China JV & India, Fundamental Fixed Income and Private Markets. The company's assets under management (AUM) increased to $2.1 trillion, marking a 6.2% rise from the previous quarter.\n\nWith $2.154 trillion in AUM at the end of November 2025, Invesco is in the second-largest tier of US-based asset managers, which includes firms like Pimco and Capital Group.\n\n### Revenue Structure  \nFor the fiscal year 2023, Invesco reported total revenue of $4.9 billion. Management fees constituted the primary revenue source, accounting for approximately $3.4 billion of total revenue. Performance fees for 2023 totaled $145 million, representing 3% of total revenue.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nRising demand for low-cost, tech-driven investment solutions is eroding pricing power and compressing margins, challenging Invesco's traditional business model. Competition from larger, technology-focused asset managers threatens Invesco's ability to innovate and defend its market share, putting future profits at risk.\n\nAnalysts doubt invesco can stabilize margins in a sector where passive funds now command $12.8 trillion in global AUM, squeezing fees. Goldman Sachs and Barclays recently lowered targets, citing lingering concerns about reliance on volatile performance fees—down 79.4% in Q1 2025 due to market instability.\n\nSecular fee pressure and intense ETF competition could cap margin expansion and make it harder for Invesco to deliver the earnings trajectory implied.\n\n### Tailwinds\nStrategic partnerships with MassMutual and Barings are set to boost private market offerings, driving asset growth and future revenue expansion.\n\nResilient economies and markets set the stage for reaccelerating growth. We believe solid corporate and household balance sheets and lower leverage than in previous cycles form a base on which global growth can potentially improve.\n\nWhile we're in the later stages of the economic cycle, we believe the environment of sound growth and benign inflation remains supportive of risky assets, with more upside potential in stocks than credit. The macroeconomic backdrop has continued to improve at a gradual and steady pace. This favorable global backdrop is seen in upward revisions in earnings expectations across all regions — a sign of broader participation in the growth cycle across countries and economic sectors.\n\n## 9.

Overall AUM: Invesco's AUM of over $2 trillion places it among the leading global asset managers, though significantly smaller than market leaders like BlackRock and Vanguard.\n\nBlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with over $12.5 trillion in assets under management as of August 6, 2025. This positions Invesco with roughly 17% of BlackRock's AUM scale.\n\n## 10.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Current Analyst Sentiment\nRBC Capital upgraded their outlook for Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) from Sector Perform to Outperform. As of January 14, 2026, the average one-year price target for Invesco is $28.88/share. The forecasts range from a low of $21.21 to a high of $35.18. The average price target represents an increase of 3.47% from its latest reported closing price of $27.91 / share.\n\nShares of asset management firm Invesco (NYSE: IVZ) jumped 3.9% in the afternoon session after RBC Capital upgraded the company from a 'Sector Perform' to an 'Outperform' rating and increased its price target on the shares. The firm pointed to an improved outlook for organic growth and the possibility for margin expansion to 37%-38% in 2026/2027. According to the analyst, potential earnings growth from the recent re-classification of its QQQ ETF was also a key factor in the decision. RBC Capital raised its price target for Invesco to $35.00 from $25.00, representing a 40% increase and reflecting renewed confidence in the company's market potential.\n\nRecent upgrades include:\n- **Goldman Sachs**: Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Blostein raised the firm's price target on Invesco (IVZ) to $28.25 from $25.50 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares.\n- **Barclays**: Invesco price target raised to $30 from $28 at Barclays\n- **RBC Capital**: RBC Capital raised its price target for Invesco to $35.00 from $25.00, representing a 40% increase and reflecting renewed confidence in the company's market potential.\n\n### Valuation Analysis\nWhile the popular narrative sees Invesco as roughly fairly priced, its 17.5x earnings multiple looks cheaper than the US Capital Markets average at 24x and close to a fair ratio of 19.2x.\n\nAt ~$29/share, IVZ trades near fair value; AFCF may reach $1B in 2025, but sustainable growth appears unlikely amid intense competition. I rate IVZ a Hold, as its prospects hinge on secular trends rather than internal value creation, with meaningful upside only at much lower prices.\n\n### Investment Rating: **7.2/10**\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis, Invesco merits a **7.2** rating on our 1-10 scale (with 10 being strongest buy).

While facing industry headwinds, the company's scale, global reach, and strategic partnerships position it well for moderate growth. Suitable for investors seeking dividend income with potential capital appreciation in a recovering asset management environment.",

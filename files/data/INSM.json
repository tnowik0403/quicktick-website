Growth Strategy\n\nInsmed outlined a commercial and clinical roadmap for 2026, highlighting strong momentum from its respiratory portfolio and a series of upcoming trial readouts and launches that could shape the company's growth over the next 18 months.\n\nKey growth pillars include:\n- **Geographic Expansion**: In November 2025, the European Commission approved BRINSUPRI for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Insmed plans to launch BRINSUPRI in the European Union in the first half of 2026.\n- **Pipeline Development**: Insmed's research efforts include more than 30 identified pre-clinical programs in development, all of which have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapies. The Company anticipates submitting an average of one to two INDs per year from its pre-clinical research programs.\n- **Multiple Clinical Catalysts**: The company expects topline results from the Phase 3 ENCORE trial of Arikayce in newly diagnosed or recurrent mycobacterium avium complex lung disease patients by March or April 2026. If successful, Insmed plans to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA in the second half of the year.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAs of year-end 2025, approximately 4,000 medical professionals had prescribed BRINSUPRI, with approximately 9,000 new patients starting therapy during the fourth quarter of 2025 alone. The company serves patients through specialized medical centers and pulmonology practices worldwide, focusing on rare disease patient populations with significant unmet medical needs.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Revenue Performance\nAccording to preliminary data, Insmed's total 2025 revenue reached $606.4 million, a 67% increase from $363.7 million in 2024.\n\n**ARIKAYCE Revenue**: ARIKAYCE exceeded guidance for 2025, with unaudited global revenues of $433.8 million, representing 19% growth over 2024. Insmed expects ARIKAYCE revenues to reach between $450 million and $470 million in 2026.\n\n**BRINSUPRI Revenue**: BRINSUPRI generated approximately $144.6 million in unaudited revenue during its first full quarter of sales, with full-year 2025 revenue reaching $172.7 million.\n\n### Financial Position\nAs of September 30, 2025, Insmed had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.7 billion. For the third quarter of 2025, Insmed reported a net loss of $370.0 million, or $1.75 per share.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **First-mover advantage**: In non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), BRINSUPRI is the first and only approved therapy, entering a market of approximately 500,000 U.S. patients with no pharmaceutical standard of care.\n- **Strong clinical results**: The DPP1 inhibitor reduces exacerbations by 19-21% and normalizes lung function decline, addressing unmet needs in chronic inflammatory lung disease treatment.\n- **Workplace recognition**: In October 2025, Insmed announced that it has earned the No. 1 ranking in Science's 2025 Top Employers Survey, marking the fifth consecutive year in which Insmed achieved the top ranking.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **High cash burn**: Despite $1.7 billion in cash providing approximately two years of runway, the company burned $687 million in operating cash through nine months of 2025.\n- **Clinical setbacks**: The Phase 2b BiRCh study of brensocatib in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) did not meet its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints.\n- **Competition**: The competitive landscape becomes more direct in pulmonary hypertension. Here, Insmed's TPIP will face United Therapeutics' Tyvaso franchise, which generated $1.62 billion in 2024 revenue.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Bronchiectasis Market\nAs the first and only FDA-approved therapy for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), Brinsupri represents entry into a $3.7 billion market with no prior disease-modifying options. Analysts project up to $3.8 billion in U.S. sales by 2034 if approved, highlighting a significant market opportunity with currently no direct approved rivals.\n\n### MAC Lung Disease Market\nIn MAC lung disease, ARIKAYCE faces no direct approved competitors, only the indirect competition of multidrug regimens that fail in refractory patients.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nArdelyx, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Corcept Therapeutics, AM-Pharma, and Cue Biopharma are some of the 76 competitors of Insmed. However, this first-mover status in rare pulmonary diseases creates a moat that traditional competitors cannot easily cross.\n\nIn the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) market, Insmed's TPIP faces established players like United Therapeutics, Bayer, and Johnson & Johnson, which possess strong portfolios of marketed products. In the gene therapy sector, particularly for conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Insmed's INS1201 competes with major players such as Sarepta and Pfizer in an area characterized by rapid advancements and significant investment.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nINS1148 (formerly known as OpSCF) was developed by Opsidio, a private, clinical-stage company. The acquisition of INS1148 adds a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody with a novel mechanism of action to Insmed's growing pipeline.\n\n### M&A Speculation\nInsmed, known for its innovative therapies targeting rare diseases, stands out among potential acquisition targets, particularly after its recent FDA approval for a new drug. Insmed's robust performance and positive analyst ratings position it well within the current M&A climate.\n\n## 12.

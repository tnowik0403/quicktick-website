Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, Insmed leverages its proprietary PRINT technology platform (Precision Pulmonary Delivery) and TPIP (Treprostinil Palmitil Inhalation Powder) platform to develop inhaled therapies that target the lungs directly, minimizing systemic exposure and side effects. The company's lead commercial product, ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), is approved in the U.S., Japan, and the EU for treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). On October 25, 2024, the FDA approved TREK NIV® (brensocatib), Insmed's first dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor, for reducing exacerbations in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), a rare lung disease affecting ~110,000 U.S. patients with limited treatments. Insmed operates in over 90 countries, with a pipeline including TPIP-101 for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and TPIP-102 for pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD). The company reported Q2 2024 net revenue of $96.8 million (up 58% YoY), driven by ARIKAYCE U.S. net revenue of $91.7 million. With ~$1.0 billion in cash equivalents as of Q2 2024, Insmed is poised for commercial launches and Phase 3 readouts.

Hold for conservative; sell only on launch misses.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $105 (38% upside from $75.91) – Based on DCF with 50% CAGR to 2028 ($2.5B revenue), 8x EV/Sales multiple (peer avg), 12% discount rate for moderate risk. Aligns with high-end analyst targets (e.g., BofA $110). Ideal for growth portfolios.",

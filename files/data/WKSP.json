(WKSP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $0.71\n- **Market Capitalization**: $7.62 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $0.45 - $2.69\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: ~1.2 million shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~10.73 million\n\n## Company Overview\nWorksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP), headquartered in West Seneca, New York, is an automotive aftermarket accessories company specializing in premium tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Founded in 2013, the company designs, manufactures, and distributes innovative truck bed covers that prioritize durability, security, and aesthetics, targeting light trucks and fleets in North America. Its flagship WorksportPRO brand offers aluminum hard-folding tonneau covers, while the AL4 line provides affordable soft-folding vinyl options. Worksport is pivoting aggressively toward electrification with its SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover system, which integrates photovoltaic panels to generate up to 400W of power, paired with the COR portable power station (20-40 kWh capacity) for EV truck charging, powering tools, or off-grid applications. This positions Worksport at the intersection of the $7B+ tonneau cover market and the burgeoning $100B+ EV accessories sector. With a direct-to-consumer e-commerce model via worksport.com and wholesale partnerships, Worksport emphasizes U.S.-made products (80% domestic sourcing) to capitalize on \"Buy American\" trends. Recent financials show revenue scaling amid supply chain normalization, but persistent losses highlight execution risks in its solar pivot.

Strong EV tailwinds justify moderate risk for 3-5x upside.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $2.50 (12-month target; DCF-based on $25M 2025 rev, 5x sales multiple for growth/EV comps like REE Automotive).

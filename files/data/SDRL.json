The company owns and operates a high-specification fleet of 17 rigs: 8 drillships, 4 semi-submersibles, and 5 jack-up rigs, with a focus on ultra-deepwater (UDW) and harsh environment operations. Headquartered in London with key offices in Houston, Dubai, and Hamilton, Seadrill serves major integrated oil companies (IOCs) and independents, emphasizing operational efficiency, safety (TRCF 0.12 incidents/million man-hours in H1 2024), and sustainability via hybrid power systems on select rigs.\n\nPost-2021 Chapter 11 restructuring (emerged Feb 2021), Seadrill streamlined its balance sheet (net debt $0 as of Q2 2024) and repositioned as a premium contractor. Contract backlog stands at $2.3B (Q2 2024), with 80% utilization. Revenue is driven by day rates averaging $360k/day fleet-wide in Q2 2024, benefiting from elevated offshore rig demand amid sustained oil prices ($70-80/bbl Brent). Seadrill targets 95%+ utilization long-term, leveraging its young fleet (average 9 years old) in key basins like Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, and Brazil.\n\n## Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of Oct 10, 2024 Close)\n| Metric              | Value          | Source                  |\n|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Stock Price        | $43.62        | Yahoo Finance / NYSE  |\n| Market Cap         | $2.37B        | Yahoo Finance          |\n| 52-Week Range      | $32.72 - $52.73 | Yahoo Finance        |\n| P/E (TTM)          | 13.2           | Yahoo Finance          |\n| EV/EBITDA (TTM)    | 4.8            | Bloomberg              |\n\n## Key Financials (Q2 2024 Earnings, Released July 25, 2024; <6 months old)\n| Metric                  | Q2 2024     | Q1 2024     | YoY Change (Q2'23) |\n|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Revenue                | $361M      | $317M      | +29%              |\n| Adjusted EBITDA        | $188M      | $147M      | +68%              |\n| Net Income             | $107M      | $114M      | N/A (post-reorg)  |\n| Gross Margin           | 52%        | 49%        | +300bps           |\n| Day Rate (Fleet Avg)   | $360k      | $338k      | +14%              |\n| Utilization            | 82%        | 76%        | +600bps           |\n\n*H1 2024 backlog: $2.3B (avg contract duration 360 days).

High day rates, backlog coverage through 2025, and buybacks support 20-30% upside amid favorable oil macro. Moderate risk via cyclical exposure offset by premium fleet/debt-free balance sheet.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $52 (20% upside from $43.62). DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth; backlog NPV $3B+), aligned with BTIG/Pareto PTs ($50-55). Hold if oil < $65/bbl; sell below $35.",

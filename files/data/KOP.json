(KOP) is a global integrated manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals, carbon-based products, and treated wood products primarily serving infrastructure, aluminum, steel, rubber, and railroad industries. Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, the company operates through three main segments: Performance Chemicals (PC, ~25% of sales), which produces wood preservatives like copper-based azoles for utility poles and railroad ties; Railroad & Utility Products and Services (RUPS, ~55% of sales), focusing on treated railroad cross-ties, switch ties, and utility poles; and Carbon Materials & Chemicals (CMC, ~20% of sales), supplying carbon pitch, naphthalene, and carbon black for aluminum smelting, steel, and tire industries. With ~3,500 employees across 28 manufacturing facilities in North America, Australia, and China, Koppers generated $2.0 billion in 2023 sales. The company benefits from vertically integrated operations, from raw coal tar processing to finished treated wood products, positioning it as a key supplier in resilient infrastructure sectors amid rising U.S. rail and utility investments. However, it faces cyclical pressures from commodity chemical pricing and carbon black oversupply.

Attractive valuation (7.8x EV/EBITDA vs. 10x peer avg), infra tailwinds, and M&A momentum outweigh CMC headwinds. Q2 beat + backlog signal 10-15% upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $52 (35% upside from $38.47). Based on 9x 2025E EBITDA ($210M midpoint guidance, 12% margin expansion) + $500M net debt adjustment. DCF assumes 8% CAGR, 10% WACC, moderate risk (infra stability offsets chem volatility). Targets align with analysts (avg. $55 from 4 firms, per MarketBeat Oct 10, 2024). Ideal for growth portfolios eyeing IIJA execution.",

Top 10 loans <20% portfolio.\n- **Potential**: Tech startups in Huntsville (NASA corridor); franchisees via SBA push.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Community-focused (local donations 0.5% profits); no major controversies.\n- **Governance**: Insider ownership 15%; no poison pill.\n- **Risks**: CRE stress tests pass (Fed simulation Aug 2024); deposit flight low (stable amid 5%+ CD rates).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold). Attractive valuation (0.85x TBV vs. peers 1.2x), stable ops, but limited growth catalysts and CRE/macro risks cap upside. Suitable for income/dividend portfolios, not aggressive growth.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $13.50 (23% upside). Based on 10x 2025E EPS $1.25 (analyst consensus from Yahoo/Seeking Alpha), 1.0x TBV target, DCF incorporating 4% loan growth/3.3% NIM. Moderate risk (beta 0.9); strong growth would require M&A or rate relief.",

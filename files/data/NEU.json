Operating through its key subsidiaries—Afton Chemical Corporation and Ethyl Corporation—NewMarket dominates the petroleum additives market, serving global customers in the refining, automotive, and industrial sectors. Its Petroleum Additives segment (over 90% of revenue) produces additives that improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, extend engine life, and enhance lubricity for gasoline, diesel, aviation fuels, and lubricants like engine oils and driveline fluids. The Specialties segment offers advanced polymer additives and other niche chemicals for coatings, plastics, and metalworking fluids.\n\nFounded in 1945 and headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, NewMarket employs ~2,300 people worldwide with manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America. In 2023, it generated $2.9 billion in revenue, driven by long-term supply contracts with major oil companies. The company emphasizes R&D innovation (investing ~4-5% of sales annually), sustainability (e.g., low-emission additives), and operational efficiency amid volatile crude oil prices. NEU's business model benefits from high barriers to entry due to proprietary formulations, regulatory approvals, and customer stickiness via multi-year contracts. It has delivered consistent profitability, with ROIC >20% historically, positioning it as a cash flow machine in a cyclical industry.

Petroleum Additives shipment volumes down 7%, but pricing discipline offset declines (per earnings call transcript, Yahoo Finance/Seeking Alpha).\n- **Q3 2024 Guidance (Earnings Call, July 31):** Expect sequential volume recovery in H2 2024 driven by North American diesel restocking; no major capex increases planned.\n- **Dividend Increase (September 5, 2024):** Raised quarterly payout 25% to $2.50/share from $2.00, signaling confidence (total 2024 payout ~$97/share annualized).\n- **Sustainability Push (August 2024):** Launched \"Ecolane\" low-SAPS lubricant additives compliant with Euro 7 emissions standards, targeting European OEMs (company press release).\n- **Leadership Change (June 2024):** Promoted Thomas E.

Suitable for income/growth portfolios).\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $650/share (DCF-based: 8% discount rate, 4% perpetual growth; implies 11% upside from $585.23. Aligns with avg analyst targets from FactSet/Bloomberg, range $600-700). Moderate risk via diversification in additives offsets cyclicality.",

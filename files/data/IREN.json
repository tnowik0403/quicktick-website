Through a strategic partnership with NVIDIA, it secures access to the latest GPUs ahead of competitors.\n- CoreWeave has become deeply embedded with AI's flagship company, OpenAI.\n- CoreWeave, whose valuation soared to $48 billion after transformation, with quarterly revenue exceeding $1.2 billion.\n\n**Nebius Group (NBIS):**\n- Hyperscalers Microsoft ($17.4-$19.4 billion deal) and Meta ($3 billion deal) are on board.\n- Vertical integration from racks to software. Global infrastructure across three continents.\n\n**Applied Digital (APLD):**\n- Total anticipated contracted lease revenues from the CoreWeave deal are now expected to be roughly $11 billion.\n\n### IREN's Competitive Advantages\n- IREN — unlike its rivals such as CoreWeave — does not rely on co-location deals but operates its own AI cloud vertical. This means that IREN is building out its own full infrastructure, from power, cooling, servers, and cloud capacity.\n- The company's vertically integrated model is a key competitive advantage. Iren develops its own sites, builds its own high-voltage infrastructure, operates its own data centers, and deploys its own GPUs.\n\n## Financial Performance & Metrics\n\n### Q1 FY26 Highlights\n- **Revenue:** Q1 revenue reached a record $240.3m (+355% vs Q1 FY25)\n- **Net Income:** net income was $384.6m\n- **Adjusted EBITDA:** adjusted EBITDA was $91.7m\n- **Cash Position:** Cash was $1.8bn as of Oct 31, 2025\n\n### Key Financial Ratios\n- **Current EBITDA:** IREN Limited EBITDA is ‪229.96 M‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is 41.15%.\n- **P/E Ratio:** The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.67.\n\n## Major Client Relationships\n\n### Microsoft Partnership\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder & Co-CEO of IREN, commented: \"We're proud to announce this milestone partnership with Microsoft, highlighting the strength and scalability of our vertically integrated AI Cloud platform.\n\n### Additional AI Clients\nNew multi-year contracts including Together AI, Fluidstack and Fireworks AI\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds\n\n### Execution Risks\n- IREN's long-term profitability faces pressure from exceptionally high capital expenditure requirements tied to rapid AI cloud expansion. The Microsoft deal alone requires $5.8 billion in GPU capital expenditures, with an additional $1.4 billion to be funded through cash, operating flow, equity, convertible notes, and corporate debt.\n- H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese recently noted that he sees \"quite high\" execution and financial risks for Iren with regard to the deal.\n\n### Market Dependencies\n- Declining Bitcoin prices are a short-term headwind for Iren. While its long-term future revolves around AI infrastructure, the company made 97% of its revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 from crypto mining.\n- AI Market Competition and Obsolescence: While the AI cloud market is booming, it's also highly competitive. Hyperscalers like Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Google (Cloud) are building their own infrastructure\n\n### Dilution Concerns\n- Persistent concerns are lingering in the market regarding the massive $2.3 billion capital raise IREN completed in early December, which involved convertible notes and share placements. While this capital is earmarked for expanding its renewable energy-powered AI data center business, investors appear to be cautiously assessing the potential dilution\n\n## Sector Tailwinds\n\n### AI Infrastructure Demand\n- Microsoft CFO Amy Hood recently acknowledged AI capacity shortages could persist through mid-2026, underscoring the urgency behind capacity deals.\n- The five-year Microsoft deal shows the AI industry's growing hunger for ⁠computing power to run applications such ‌as ChatGPT. It follows earnings from major tech companies last week that underscored capacity shortages were limiting their ability to fully benefit from the boom.\n\n### Renewable Energy Focus\n- The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials of IREN's operations are also a key differentiator. As institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability, IREN's reliance on renewable energy enhances its appeal.\n\n## Analyst Coverage & Price Targets\n\n### Wall Street Consensus\n- Across Wall Street, Iren Limited's shares continue to carry a Moderate Buy consensus rating from analysts. This breaks down to eight Buys, two Holds, and two Sells issued by 12 analysts over the past three months. In addition, the average IREN price target of $80.40 suggests about 67% upside from current trading levels.\n\n### Recent Analyst Actions\n- Analysts believe that Nebius is currently the best buy of the three. (referring to CoreWeave, IREN, and Nebius comparison)\n\n## Investment Thesis & Rating\n\n### Buy Rating: 8/10\n\n**Rationale for High Rating:**\n\n**Growth Potential (9/10):** Iren stock has delivered life-changing returns in 2025, and the Microsoft deal provides a clear path to sustained growth through 2026 and beyond.

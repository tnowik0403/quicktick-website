Growth Strategy\n\n**Strategic Pivot to AI Infrastructure:**\nIREN is pivoting from Bitcoin mining to an AI cloud and data center business, driving significant investor interest. The company differentiates itself by controlling the entire infrastructure stack, from power substations to GPUs, and focuses on colocation and GPU-as-a-Service offerings.\n\n**Vertical Integration Advantage:**\nIREN benefits from end-to-end vertical integration, designing, building, and operating its own data centers and GPU stack, which eliminates third-party colocation risk and enhances cost control.\n\n**Power-First Approach:**\n- Once deployed, the capacity is expected to support the same $3.4 billion annualized run-rate revenue target while using only 16% of the company's secured three gigawatts of power, leaving significant room for further expansion.\n- Land footprint: 2,000+ acres available for both mining and AI/data center builds. AI/data centers are extremely power-hungry, and IREN can provide dedicated, low-cost, renewable power.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Microsoft Partnership:**\nUnder the agreement, IREN will provide Microsoft with access to NVIDIA GB300 GPUs over a five-year term, with a total contract value of approximately $9.7 billion, including a 20% prepayment.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q1 FY26 Results (Most Recent):**\n- Total revenue increased to record $240.3m (+355% vs. Q1 FY25 $52.8m) Net income increased to record $384.6m* (vs. Q1 FY25 net loss $(51.7)m)\n- Adj. EBITDA increased to $91.7m (+3,568% vs. Q1 FY25)\n- IREN (IREN) reported Q1 2026 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08, beating estimates of $0.15 by 620.00%.\n- A bulk of the revenue still came from bitcoin mining, which delivered $232.9 million, while AI cloud services contributed $7.3 million, driven by early commercial GPU deployments.\n\n**Financial Strength:**\n- In Q1 2026, IREN reported total assets of $4.27 billion, with a strong liquidity position indicated by $1.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n- IREN Limited EBITDA is ‪229.96 M‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is 41.15%.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Bitcoin Mining Market Position:**\nBitcoin Mining as a Foundation: Profitable Bitcoin mining operations, reaching 50 EH/s by mid-2025 positions IREN among the top-tier Bitcoin miners globally.\n\n**AI Infrastructure Market Position:**\nA $9.7 billion, five-year GPU cloud services contract with Microsoft validates IREN's strategic shift and secures a stable, long-term revenue stream. This contract establishes IREN as a significant player in the AI infrastructure market with substantial growth potential.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA): The world's largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner, with over 58 EH/s hash rate. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT): A major North American player with large facilities in Texas and over 33 EH/s hash rate. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK): Reached 50 EH/s operational hash rate in June 2025, emphasizing low-carbon energy. Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ): Offers large-scale Bitcoin mining and enterprise hosting solutions, with over 19 EH/s hash power.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- In the race to scale AI infrastructure, Cipher Mining holds a significant edge. Its power-first HPC model, long-duration hyperscaler contracts, lower hardware risk, and disciplined balance-sheet strategy provide clearer earnings visibility and superior risk-adjusted returns.\n- The EV/Revenue multiple of 19.6x represents a significant premium to Bitcoin mining peers: Marathon Digital trades at 7.9x, Riot Platforms at 10.3x, and CleanSpark at 6.3x. The market is no longer valuing IREN as a miner but as an AI infrastructure provider.\n\n**AI Infrastructure Competitors:**\n- CoreWeave CRWV has emerged as a top rival to IREN by rapidly scaling AI-native, GPU-optimized data centers backed by deep NVIDIA partnerships. CoreWeave operates across 33 sites in the United States and Europe, secures multi-billion-dollar contracts with OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta, and is building large-scale GPU supercomputers. With early GPU access and AI-focused cloud services, CoreWeave's speed and scale give a clear competitive edge.\n\n## 10.

Recent Developments\n\n**November 2024 - Company Rebrand:**\nThe company was formerly known as Iris Energy Limited and changed its name to IREN Limited in November 2024.\n\n**November 2025 - Microsoft Contract:**\nThe news sent shares of IREN up as much as 24.7% to a record high on Monday following the Microsoft contract announcement.\n\n**December 2025 - Capital Raising:**\nIREN Closes $2.3 Billion Convertible Notes Offering and the Repurchase of Existing Convertible Notes · NEW YORK, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IREN Limited (NASDAQ: IREN) (\"IREN\") today announced the closing of its offering of convertible senior notes and repurchase of certain existing\n\n**January 2026 - Recent Performance:**\nGoldman Sachs rates Iren \"Neutral\" with $39 target, foreseeing revenue jump to $3.8B in 2028. IREN concludes a $2.3 billion convertible notes offering, boosting financial strategies and shareholder actions.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 8/10**\n\n**Rationale for Rating:**\n- **Strong Growth Trajectory:** Revenue growth of 235% over 12 months vastly outpaces peers and the Microsoft contract provides substantial revenue visibility\n- **Strategic Positioning:** Successfully pivoted from pure Bitcoin mining to AI infrastructure at the right time, capitalizing on AI compute demand\n- **Competitive Advantages:** Vertically integrated model with substantial power resources and renewable energy focus\n- **Financial Strength:** Strong balance sheet with over $1B in cash and improving margins\n- **Market Validation:** The $9.7B Microsoft contract validates the business model and provides long-term revenue certainty\n\n**Risks to Consider:**\n- IREN's long-term profitability faces pressure from exceptionally high capital expenditure requirements tied to rapid AI cloud expansion. The Microsoft (MSFT) deal alone requires $5.8 billion in GPU capital expenditures, with an additional $1.4 billion to be funded through cash, operating flow, equity, convertible notes, and corporate debt.\n- High valuation multiples compared to traditional mining peers\n- Execution risk on rapid GPU scaling and data center construction\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $75-85**\n\nBased on the current fundamentals, growth trajectory, and market positioning, IREN appears fairly valued to slightly undervalued in the $75-85 range. This yields a fair value of $81.38, representing 68% upside to its current price according to some analyst projections. The stock offers strong growth upside for investors with moderate risk appetite, particularly given the contracted revenue from Microsoft and the company's leading position in the AI infrastructure buildout cycle.\n\nThe combination of established Bitcoin mining cash flows funding AI infrastructure expansion, substantial power resources, and the validation from major hyperscaler partnerships makes IREN a compelling investment opportunity in the AI infrastructure space, despite near-term execution risks and capital intensity.",

Company Overview\n\nIREN Limited (formerly known as Iris Energy Limited, name changed in November 2024) is an Australia-based company incorporated in 2018 and based in Sydney, Australia. The company operates as a vertically integrated data center business powering Bitcoin, AI and beyond with renewable energy, strategically located in renewable-rich, fiber-connected regions across the US and Canada. IREN owns and operates data centers powered by 100% renewable energy, with facilities optimized for Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence (AI) cloud services, and other power-dense compute. The company has successfully pivoted from a pure-play Bitcoin miner to a leading provider of AI cloud infrastructure, representing one of the most remarkable corporate turnarounds of the mid-2020s. By early 2026, the company has effectively \"broken the cycle\" of crypto volatility, with 90% of its valuation now derived from its AI and HPC contracts.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nIREN Limited trades at $50.94 with a market cap of $16.73 billion as of January 13, 2026. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.36. In the last year, IREN shares hit a 52-week high of $76.87 and a 52-week low of $5.13. Over the last year IREN Limited has showed a 408.43% increase. Technical analysis shows a strong buy rating today, with a 1-month rating showing a strong buy signal.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nIREN operates three main business verticals:\n\n• **Bitcoin Mining:** One of the world's largest and lowest-cost Bitcoin producers with 50 EH/s of installed self-mining capacity. The company has achieved a spot power rate of just 3.1¢/kWh at the Childress site in Texas—one of the lowest in the industry.\n\n• **AI Cloud Services:** Delivering high performance cloud compute to AI customers with next-generation NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. IREN has secured customer contracts for 11k of the 23k GPUs, representing approximately $225m in AI Cloud ARR, expected to be in operation by the end of 2025.\n\n• **Data Centers:** 810MW of operating data centers underpinning three verticals: Bitcoin Mining, AI Cloud Services and AI Data Centers. Currently, IREN's operations take place across three data centers in British Columbia, Canada, spanning 160 megawatts (MW) in total. However, IREN has also purchased another massive 2.75 gigawatts (GW) of power-connected land in Texas, across two sites named Horizon and Childress.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe GPUs will be deployed in 4 phases through 2026 (Horizon 1-4) and will collectively provide 200MW of critical IT load. IREN is targeting $3.4bn in AI Cloud annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) by the end of 2026 with expansion to 140k GPUs. The British Columbia campuses, together with the Horizon 1 & 2 data centers under construction in Childress, provide capacity for more than 100k GPUs. IREN is converting its British Columbia site from ASICs to GPUs by the end of 2026 and advancing its 2GW Sweetwater Hub.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nIREN's management has outlined a strategy to mitigate Bitcoin mining volatility through the stable earnings profile of AI infrastructure, while enhancing energy efficiency and ESG alignment in its data centers to maximize long-term enterprise value. The company secured several new multi-year contracts, including a landmark partnership with Microsoft, which solidifies IREN's position as a leading AI Cloud Service Provider and expands our reach into new hyperscale customer segments. The announced expansion to 140k GPUs represents only 16% of our 3GW grid-connected power portfolio, providing ample capacity to continue scaling IREN's AI Cloud platform.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Confirmed Major Clients:**\n• **Microsoft:** $9.7 billion multi-year agreement valued to deploy GPU cloud infrastructure powered by NVIDIA GB300 GPUs.\n• **Together AI, Fireworks AI, Fluidstack:** Multi-year agreements with Together AI, Fireworks AI and Fluidstack have pushed IREN's AI Cloud annualised recurring revenue above $500 million by early 2026.\n• **Dell Technologies:** IREN also entered into an agreement with Dell Technologies to purchase the GPUs and ancillary equipment for approximately $5.8 billion.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nQ1 FY26 total revenue increased to record $240.3m (+355% vs. Q1 FY25 $52.8m) and Net income increased to record $384.6m (vs. Q1 FY25 net loss $(51.7)m). Adjusted EBITDA increased to $91.7m (+3,568% vs. Q1 FY25 $2.5m). IREN Limited EBITDA is ‪229.96 M‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is 41.15%. Cash on hand reached $1.8 billion as of October 31, 2025. Bitcoin mining revenue made up the majority of the company's revenue, at $232.9 million, while AI cloud services revenue was only $7.3 million.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nWhile CoreWeave operates over 250,000 GPUs and leads the sector, IREN is pursuing a more measured expansion strategy based on a debt-light capital structure and internal cash generation. The core driving force behind the mining industry's strategic shift toward AI/HPC infrastructure services is the search for diversified profit models—as proven by the success of CoreWeave, whose valuation soared to $48 billion after transformation, with quarterly revenue exceeding $1.2 billion.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**IREN vs. CoreWeave:**\nIREN differentiates itself from competitors such as CoreWeave in the AI compute market. From site selection and power interconnection to data center design, construction, and hardware operations, IREN manages the entire value chain internally. This allows for faster expansion, reduced external risks, and enhanced flexibility and reliability in operations. IREN is still in the early stages of transitioning into the AI business, with a low share of AI cloud in its overall revenue. The absence of an in-house software platform for GPU workload optimization is a technological disadvantage compared to CoreWeave.\n\n**IREN vs. Other Bitcoin Miners:**\nBoth Cipher Mining and IREN have delivered sharp gains over the past six months, but Cipher Mining has clearly outperformed. CIFR surged 313.2% during the period, compared with a 254.4% rise in IREN. Among the three (Hut 8, Core Scientific, and IREN), IREN presents the most direct, capital-backed play on AI cloud infrastructure growth, whereas HUT stock and CORZ stock remain partially tethered to crypto cycles, offering higher upside potential but materially greater volatility.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIREN announced a multi-year agreement with Microsoft valued at approximately $9.7 billion. The five-year contract includes a 20 percent prepayment and is expected to contribute roughly $1.94 billion in annualized run rate revenue once fully commissioned. In conjunction with the announcement of the Microsoft partnership, IREN also entered into an agreement with Dell Technologies to purchase the GPUs and ancillary equipment for approximately $5.8 billion. IREN signed additional multi-year cloud services contracts with leading AI companies for NVIDIA Blackwell GPU deployments, targeting >$500m in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) from the 23k GPUs currently operating.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n• In early January 2026, IREN Limited filed a US$660.98 million shelf registration for 17,500,000 ordinary shares linked to an employee share plan, while continuing to pivot its power-backed data centers toward AI cloud workloads alongside traditional Bitcoin mining.\n\n• After achieving Nvidia preferred partner status in August, supply and demand for IREN's capacity skyrocketed.\n\n• IREN reported a 355% year-on-year revenue rise to $240.3 million in Q1 FY26, alongside a swing to $384.6 million in net income.\n\n• Shares surged more than 20% following the Microsoft announcement and have rallied 500% over the past year.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 8.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Strong transformation from Bitcoin mining to AI infrastructure with major Microsoft contract validation\n- The 2026 guidance for $3.4 billion ARR only accounts for approximately 16% of IREN's 2.91 GW of capacity. Using simple math, this indicates that IREN has the potential to generate $21.25 billion in revenue at current lease rates on its grid-connected land.\n- Vertically integrated platform with secured low-cost renewable power\n- Significant room for growth with substantial unused power capacity\n- Strong financial performance with record revenues and positive cash generation\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- IREN's long-term profitability faces pressure from exceptionally high capital expenditure requirements tied to rapid AI cloud expansion. The Microsoft deal alone requires $5.8 billion in GPU capital expenditures.\n- The reliance on NVIDIA's hardware roadmap means that any delays in GPU shipments could stall IREN's growth. Furthermore, as more miners enter the AI space, competition for technical talent and specialized cooling equipment is expected to intensify.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $75-85**\n\nBased on the Given IREN's market cap is still just $15.1 billion, the stock could be a potential bargain, even after its impressive 2025 performance. The fair value estimate considers the company's secured power capacity potential, major contract revenues, and execution risks in the rapidly evolving AI infrastructure market. Analyst price estimates range from a max estimate of 136.00 USD to a min estimate of 39.00 USD, suggesting significant valuation uncertainty but substantial upside potential for investors with moderate risk tolerance seeking growth exposure to the AI infrastructure buildout.",

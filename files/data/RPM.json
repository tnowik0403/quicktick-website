(NYSE: RPM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nRPM International Inc. is a global leader in specialty coatings, sealants, caulks, and building products, operating through a portfolio of over 60 subsidiaries under well-known brands. Founded in 1947 and headquartered in Medina, Ohio, the company serves industrial, specialty, consumer, and construction markets worldwide. Its Consumer segment (e.g., Rust-Oleum paints, DAP sealants) targets DIY and professional end-users via retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's. The Construction Products Group (CPG, including Tremco sealants and roof systems) focuses on commercial building maintenance and infrastructure. Performance Coatings Group (PCG, e.g., Dex-O-Tex floors, Stonhard epoxies) caters to industrial flooring and corrosion protection. The Specialty Products Group supports niche applications like fireproofing and adhesives.\n\nRPM generates ~$7.4B in annual revenue (FY2024), with ~50% from North America, emphasizing repair-and-maintenance (R&M) over new construction to mitigate cyclicality. The company pursues growth via acquisitions (200+ historically), organic innovation, and margin expansion through pricing and productivity. It benefits from fragmented markets, sticky brands, and secular tailwinds like infrastructure spending, but faces headwinds from housing slowdowns and raw material volatility.

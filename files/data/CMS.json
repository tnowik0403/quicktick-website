The company generates, purchases, transmits, and distributes electricity to 1.9 million electric customers and natural gas to 1.8 million gas customers, with a regulated rate base of ~$32 billion as of Q3 2024. CMS also engages in independent power production via its Energy Resource Management segment, though this is minor (~1-2% of earnings). \n\nStrategically positioned in the Great Lakes region, CMS focuses on reliable service amid Michigan's industrial base (auto, manufacturing) and growing population centers like Grand Rapids and Detroit suburbs. The company is accelerating its clean energy transition, targeting 90% carbon-free electricity by 2040, with heavy investments in renewables (wind, solar), grid modernization, and electrification. In 2023, it served ~20% of Michigan's total electric load and ~50% of gas load. CMS emphasizes customer affordability, with annual bill reductions for 13 straight years (e.g., electric bills down 17% since 2017), while delivering steady regulated returns (9.9-10.2% ROE equity target). With $3-3.5B annual capex (60% on renewables/grid), CMS balances shareholder returns via dividends (52-year streak) and ~$1B share repurchases authorized through 2026.

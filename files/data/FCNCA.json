(FCNCA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of November 4, 2024, close; verified via Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $1,913.50 |\n| Market Capitalization | $27.58 billion |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $2,011.05 / $1,442.30 |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | 14.2 |\n| Dividend Yield | 0.11% |\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. (FCNCA) is a Raleigh, North Carolina-based bank holding company and the parent of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, a top-15 U.S. bank by assets with approximately $220 billion in total assets as of Q3 2024. The company provides a full suite of commercial banking, retail banking, and wealth management services across 23 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands through ~550 branches. FCNCA's transformative growth accelerated via the 2022 acquisition of CIT Group ($23B assets) and the 2023 FDIC-brokered purchase of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) assets (~$72B deposits, $40B loans at a bargain $16.5B discount). This positioned FCNCA as a leading middle-market commercial lender, with expertise in venture banking, asset-based lending, equipment finance (from CIT), and tech/innovation sectors (from SVB). Post-SVB, the bank has stabilized deposits (SVB deposits now ~12% of total) and leveraged high-margin loans for profitability. Leadership transitioned with Executive Chairman Frank B. Holding, Jr.'s death on October 28, 2024; CEO Craig L. Nix remains at helm. FCNCA emphasizes prudent risk management, strong capital ratios (CET1 13.1% Q3 2024), and shareholder returns via buybacks ($1.5B authorized remaining).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported October 24, 2024; verified via company 8-K and earnings transcript on Seeking Alpha/FirstCitizens.com)**:\n  | Key Metric | Q3 2024 | QoQ Change (Q2) | YoY Change |\n  |------------|---------|-----------------|------------|\n  | Net Interest Income | $1.78 billion | +13% | +51% |\n  | Net Income (GAAP) | $775 million | +5% | N/M (SVB impact) |\n  | Diluted EPS | $49.42 | +4% | N/M |\n  | Provision for Credit Losses | $220 million | +47% | N/M |\n  | Total Deposits | $208 billion | +1% | +19% |\n  | ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity) | 20.4% | N/A | N/A |\n  - Highlights: Loan growth +2% QoQ to $153B; NIM expanded to 3.63%; SVB deposits stable at $25B.\n- **SVB Securities Divestiture (Announced October 15, 2024)**: Sold SVB Securities brokerage to TowerBrook Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs for $1.4B cash (~1.8x book value), expected close Q1 2025; proceeds for buybacks/debt reduction.\n- **Executive Chairman Death (October 28, 2024)**: Frank B.

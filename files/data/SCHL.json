The company operates across four segments: Children's Book Publishing & Distribution (trade publishing, book clubs, and book fairs), Classroom Magazines (print/digital periodicals like Scholastic News and Scope), Education (intervention programs like READ 180 and System 44), and International (operations in Canada, UK, Australia, and Asia). Iconic franchises include U.S. rights to *Harry Potter*, *The Hunger Games*, *Goosebumps*, *Clifford the Big Red Dog*, and *Dog Man*. Scholastic's book fair business is dominant in North America, organizing ~120,000 fairs annually reaching 90 million students. It emphasizes literacy promotion amid declining reading rates, with digital expansions like Scholastic Learning Suite. In FY2024 (ended May 31, 2024), the company generated revenue primarily from U.S. channels (75%), with book fairs/clubs contributing ~45%. Challenges include shifting consumer habits toward digital media, but strengths lie in direct school access and evergreen IPs.

Net loss: $27.5 million ($0.97/share) vs. net income $9.4 million ($0.32/share) prior year, driven by $55 million pre-tax inventory write-down in Book Fairs (supply chain issues, lower demand).

Overall revenue CAGR: 2-4% through FY2027 (per mgmt guidance, tempered by Q1 softness).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (FY2023/24 Est.) | SCHL | Penguin Random House (Private) | HarperCollins (Private) | Pearson (PSO.L) |\n|-------------------------|------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Rev ($B)** | 1.8 | ~4.5 (global) | ~2.0 | 4.8 (ed only) |\n| **Children's % of Rev** | 70% | 25% | 30% | 10% |\n| **Gross Margin** | 46% | ~55% | 52% | 40% |\n| **School Penetration** | High (K-8) | Low | Medium | High (K-12) |\n| **Strengths vs. SCHL** | - | Scale/IP diversity | YA focus | Digital edtech |\n| **SCHL Edge** | Fairs/Clubs moat | - | - | Niche literacy |\n\nSCHL trades at 7.5x FY25 EV/EBITDA est. (vs. peers 10-12x); P/E 22x forward.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Epic! (digital distro, expanded Sep 2024); DreamWorks (Dog Man film); Warner Bros. (HP licensing); OverDrive (e-books to libraries).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Make Believe Ideas (UK kids' books, 2023); No major 2024 deals; Watching edtech tuck-ins ($50M cash hoard).\n- **Major Clients**: 110K+ U.S. schools (95% elementary); Districts like NYC DOE, LAUSD; Retail (Amazon, Target ~30% trade sales). Potential: Homeschool networks (HSLDA), charter growth (20% U.S. schools).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong literacy advocacy (Read-a-Palooza events donated 1M+ books 2024); Diversity push amid bans (50% titles diverse authors).\n- **Management**: CEO Margo Marsh (since 2022) ex-Pearson; Focus on cost discipline (SG&A down 2% FY24).\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (book challenges in 26 states); Cyclical fairs (90% H1 revenue).\n- **Opportunities**: AI literacy tools; Global fairs (Asia pilots).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 5/10 (Hold). Fundamentals solid (cash-rich, IP moat) but near-term headwinds (fairs decline, bans) cap upside; trading near book value with limited growth catalysts vs. edtech peers.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $34.00 (19% upside from $28.46). Based on 10x FY26 EBITDA ($120M est., mgmt-guided 3% CAGR) + 20% IP premium; DCF (8% WACC, 2.5% terminal) aligns. Suited for moderate-risk growth portfolios seeking 10-15% annualized returns via dividends (1.7% yield) and *Dog Man*/digital recovery. Monitor Q2 FY25 (Dec 2024) for fairs rebound.",

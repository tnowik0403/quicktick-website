(NRXS) is a commercial-stage neuromodulation medical technology company specializing in non-surgical, FDA-cleared therapies for pediatric patients with functional abdominal pain (FAP) disorders, primarily irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The company's lead product, IB-Stim®, is a percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulator (PENFS) system that delivers targeted stimulation to cranial nerves via an earpiece worn for 5 days, modulating dysfunctional brain-gut interactions to reduce chronic abdominal pain. Approved in 2017 for ages 11-18, IB-Stim has treated over 15,000 patients across 1,000+ U.S. providers, focusing on outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinics. NeurAxis operates in the $1B+ U.S. pediatric GI market, addressing unmet needs where pharmaceuticals often fail (e.g., 30-50% non-response rates). Recent expansions target younger patients (ages 8+), supported by NIH-funded studies like the landmark RCT (published 2021 in *JAMA Pediatrics*) showing 62% pain reduction vs. sham. With a direct sales model, insurance reimbursement from Aetna, Cigna, and others covering ~60% of lives, NeurAxis aims for scalable growth amid rising pediatric GI diagnoses (affecting 25% of U.S. kids).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release.

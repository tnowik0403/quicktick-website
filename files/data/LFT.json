(LFT) is a New York City-based real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in commercial real estate (CRE) finance, with a primary focus on originating, acquiring, financing, selling, and managing a diversified portfolio of CRE mortgage loans and other CRE debt investments. Established in 2011 (originally as BRT Realty Trust, rebranded post-2021 spin-off from Lument), LFT targets small-balance loans ($1-20 million), emphasizing multifamily properties (over 80% of portfolio), affordable housing via HUD/FHA programs, and select office/industrial assets. Externally managed by Lument (a subsidiary of ORIX Corporation since 2023), LFT operates through four channels: whole loan sales, securitizations, portfolio retention, and third-party servicing. As of Q2 2024, its CECL-adjusted portfolio stood at $1.038 billion, generating stable cash flows via net interest income and servicing fees. LFT aims to deliver shareholder value through high dividend yields (historically 10%+), portfolio growth amid multifamily demand, and opportunistic risk management in a high-rate environment. With a lean structure and access to agency lending (Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae), LFT differentiates as a niche player in the fragmented $1T+ U.S. CRE lending market, balancing yield with moderate leverage (0.9x debt-to-equity).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings** (released August 7, 2024): Distributable earnings of $4.4 million ($0.20/share, verified from earnings release and transcript on lumentfinancetrust.com).

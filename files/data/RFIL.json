(NASDAQ: RFIL), founded in 1979 and headquartered in San Diego, California, designs, manufactures, and markets innovative interconnect products and systems primarily for the wireless telecommunications, data communications, instrumentation, aerospace/defense, medical, OEM, and broadcast markets. The company operates through three main segments: RF Connectors (specialized connectors for harsh environments), RF Cable Assemblies (custom coaxial cables and harnesses), and Custom Cabling & Electromechanical Solutions (including fiber optic assemblies and integrated systems). RFIL's products enable reliable signal transmission in high-frequency applications, supporting 5G infrastructure, military communications, and data centers. With ~150 employees and facilities in California, Florida, and New Mexico, RFIL emphasizes quick-turn manufacturing, ISO-certified quality, and custom solutions for Tier 1 wireless carriers (e.g., Verizon, AT&T), OEMs, and defense contractors. The company has pursued growth via acquisitions to expand into fiber optics and defense, positioning itself in high-margin niches amid 5G buildouts and defense spending surges. FY2024 revenue was ~$140M (full-year audited), with a focus on recurring revenue from long-term contracts. RFIL remains a micro-cap player with strong balance sheet liquidity but faces cyclical telecom demand volatility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 24, 2024**: Reported Q1 FY2025 earnings (quarter ended October 31, 2023?

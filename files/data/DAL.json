(DAL) is a leading global airline headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, operating an extensive network of passenger and cargo services. As one of the largest U.S. carriers by revenue and capacity, Delta flies to over 300 destinations across 52 countries on six continents, serving 160+ million passengers annually pre-COVID (recovering to ~120 million in 2023). Its main hub is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (world's busiest), with key hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, New York-LaGuardia/JFK, Boston, Seattle, and Tokyo-Haneda (joint venture). Delta's fleet comprises ~990 mainline aircraft (average age ~12 years, fuel-efficient Boeing/Airbus models) plus 300+ regional jets via partners.\n\nDelta differentiates through premium products (Delta One suites, Premium Select, Comfort+), a robust SkyMiles loyalty program (85M+ members, world's highest engagement per 2024 JD Power study), and operational reliability (top on-time performance per 2024 DOT data). Revenue mix: ~90% passenger (domestic 60%, international 30%), 10% cargo/refined products. Post-COVID, Delta emphasizes capacity discipline, premium revenue (45% of PRASM in Q3 2024), and international growth amid strong leisure/business travel demand. Challenges include fuel volatility and labor costs, but Delta's investment-grade balance sheet ($20B+ liquidity as of Q3 2024) supports resilience.

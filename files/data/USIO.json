(formerly USA Technologies) is a fintech company specializing in integrated payment and commerce technology solutions for the unattended retail (UTR) sector, including vending machines, kiosks, laundromats, car washes, and micromarkets. Its flagship ePort® platform enables seamless cashless payments via credit/debit cards, mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and contactless methods, processing over 100 million transactions annually. USIO serves ~4 million devices across North America, focusing on value-added services like telemetry for inventory management, dynamic pricing, and consumer engagement tools. The company's cloud-based SaaS model generates recurring revenue from transaction fees (80-85% of total), equipment sales/leasing, and software subscriptions. With roots dating back to 1994, USIO has pivoted from hardware-centric to a full-stack payments ecosystem, targeting the $50B+ UTR market where cashless penetration is ~40-50% in the US (rising from 20% pre-COVID). It emphasizes partnerships with OEMs (e.g., vending manufacturers) and operators to drive adoption amid the shift to digital payments.

However, execution risks, competition, and microcap volatility cap enthusiasm. Suitable for growth portfolios willing to stomach 30-50% swings.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$2.10** (48% upside from $1.42).  \n  Based on 1.2x FY25E sales ($115M revenue est.) + DCF (12% IRR, 15% growth 3yrs tapering to 5%).

Daily Volume: 1.47 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nDelek US Holdings, Inc. (DK) is an independent downstream energy company focused on petroleum refining, logistics, and renewable fuels. Headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, Delek operates three refineries with a combined crude throughput capacity of approximately 302,000 barrels per day (bpd): El Dorado, KS (80,000 bpd), Tyler, TX (75,000 bpd), Big Spring, TX (73,000 bpd), and Krotz Springs, LA (74,000 bpd). These facilities produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and asphalt, primarily serving the PADD 2 (Midwest) and PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) markets. Through its subsidiary Delek Logistics Partners, LP (DKL), it owns ~450 miles of crude and product pipelines, storage tanks, and terminals. Delek also ventures into renewables, producing renewable diesel at Big Spring (current ~10 million gallons/year capacity). The company markets fuels via third-party branded and unbranded channels, emphasizing cost efficiency, crack spread optimization, and capital returns. In 2023, refining represented ~85% of EBITDA; logistics ~15%. Delek targets mid-cycle refining margins amid volatile energy markets, with a focus on debt reduction and shareholder returns (NYSE: DK; ~65M shares outstanding).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Reported adjusted EBITDA of $80.8M (vs. $142M in Q2 2023); net loss of $247.7M primarily due to $284M refinery turnaround costs and Big Spring turnaround overruns. Revenue: $3.02B (down 15% YoY). Refining utilization: 88%.\n- **Big Spring Refinery Incident (July 13, 2024)**: Electrical fire led to temporary shutdown; full restart by late July. Impacted Q3 throughput.\n- **Q3 2024 Guidance (Aug 7, 2024)**: Refinery throughput ~280k-290k bpd; adjusted EBITDA $75M-$125M, reflecting lower crack spreads.\n- **Debt Refinancing (Sept 30, 2024)**: Extended $1.15B revolving credit facility maturity to Oct 2029; reduced commitments by $100M.\n- **Share Repurchases**: $50M authorized in Q2 2024; repurchased ~2.5M shares YTD at avg. $28/share.\n- **Analyst Coverage**: Recent downgrades (e.g., Mizuho \"Neutral\" Oct 8, 2024, PT $25) citing weak Gulf Coast crack spreads.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Capital Discipline**: Prioritize debt reduction (net debt ~$2.5B as of Q2); target leverage <2.0x EBITDA by 2025.\n- **Renewables Expansion**: Scale Big Spring renewable diesel to 20M gal/year by 2025; evaluate El Dorado conversion (feasibility study ongoing).\n- **Logistics Growth**: DKL dropdowns and acquisitions to grow fee-based EBITDA to $300M+ annually.\n- **Marketing Optimization**: Expand unbranded rack forwards (70% of volumes); target 10-15% EBITDA margins via throughput maximization.\n- **Shareholder Returns**: 5-10% FCF yield; dividends resumed Q4 2023 at $0.245/quarter.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Strong logistics stability (DKL yields 10%+); renewables ramp-up offsets refining volatility; cost cuts post-turnarounds (~$50M savings targeted). | Big Spring overruns ($100M+ hit); high debt ($3.8B gross); regional crack spread weakness (3-2-1 ~$15/bbl Gulf Coast). |\n| **Sector-Wide (US Refining)** | High utilization (92% national); EV transition delays boost diesel demand; IMO 2020 compliant fuels premium. | Widening WTI/Brent spread hurts imports; potential oversupply from new capacity (e.g., Phillips 66 Rodeo); regulatory ESG pressures on legacy refiners. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Refining**: Gasoline (45% output), diesel/ultra-low sulfur diesel (40%), jet fuel (10%), asphalt/heavy oils (5%).\n- **Logistics (DKL)**: Crude gathering (Tyler/El Dorado), product pipelines (Big Spring to West Texas), terminals (7 owned, 2 leased).\n- **Marketing**: ~250M gal/month rack sales; branded (76, Shell) and unbranded.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Renewable Diesel Expansion**: Big Spring Phase 2 (10M gal/year addl. capacity; startup H2 2025; $30M capex).\n- **El Dorado Hydrogen Plant**: Potential renewable fuels co-processing unit (under evaluation; FID 2025).\n- **DKL Acquisitions**: Scouting $200M+ midstream bolt-ons (announced pipeline review Q3 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **US Refining Capacity Share**: 302k bpd / 17.8M bpd total = ~1.7% (source: EIA, Q2 2024).\n- **Renewable Diesel**: <0.1% of US 3B gal/year market (negligible but growing).\n- **Forecast**: Refining share stable/decline to 1.5% by 2026 (consolidation favors majors); renewables to 0.5% with expansions. Overall EBITDA mix shifts to 70/30 refining/logistics+renewables by 2027.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | DK | Valero (VLO) | Marathon (MPC) | PBF Energy (PBF) | HollyFrontier/ HF Sinclair (DINO) |\n|-----------------------------|----|--------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Refining Capacity (k bpd)  | 302 | 3,200       | 3,050         | 1,000           | 678                            |\n| Market Cap ($B)            | 1.3 | 45          | 55            | 3.5             | 7.5                            |\n| EV/EBITDA                  | 5.2 | 4.8         | 4.5           | 4.2             | 5.0                            |\n| Refining Margos ($/bbl)    | $8  | $12         | $11           | $9              | $10                            |\n| Renewables Exposure        | Emerging | Significant | Moderate     | Minimal         | High (reg gen)                 |\n\n*DK trades at discount to peers on scale but premium on renewables upside; higher leverage risk.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: DKL joint ventures (e.g., Lion Oil Pipeline Co.); renewable offtake with ADM (2023 MOU for soy oil).\n- **M&A**: No major 2024 deals; past: Alon USA acquisition (2019). Pipeline M&A scouting ($100-300M targets).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Wholesale marketers (Mansfield, Parkland); retailers (76 stations); DKL serves DK refineries (90% volumes).\n- **Potential Clients**: EVgo/Chargers for biofuels; West Texas producers for crude supply.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Committed to Scope 1/2 emissions reduction (20% by 2030); renewables = 5% production target by 2027.\n- **Management**: CEO Avigal Soreq (since 2021) emphasizes FCF over growth; insider ownership ~2%.\n- **Risks**: Commodity exposure (60% EBITDA beta to cracks); turnaround execution (history of overruns).\n- **Opportunities**: Crack rebound (2H24 forecast $20+/bbl Midwest); DKL IDRs reset boosts distributions.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10 (Hold/Sell Bias)** – Weak near-term refining outlook (low cracks, maintenance drag) offsets logistics stability; renewables too nascent for growth upside. Moderate risk appetite unmet due to leverage/volatility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $23.50 (20% upside) – DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth; $400M 2025 EBITDA trough). Catalysts: Q3 beat, renewables FID. Risks: Prolonged $10/bbl cracks → $18 downside.",

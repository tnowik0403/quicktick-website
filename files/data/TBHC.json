Risk: Decline to 4% if macro reimbursement cuts (e.g., Medicare Advantage scrutiny).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (TTM as of latest) | TBHC      | R1 RCM (RCM) | Waystar (WAY) | Change HC (soon public) |\n|---------------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| Revenue                   | $351M    | $2.4B       | $1B+         | $3.5B                  |\n| EBITDA Margin             | 15.5%    | 8%          | 25%          | 12%                    |\n| Rural Focus               | High     | Low         | Medium       | Low                    |\n| EV/EBITDA Multiple        | 4.5x     | 12x         | 15x          | 10x                    |\n- **Edge**: TBHC's rural moat and 15%+ margins beat peers; undervalued vs. scale players.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Microsoft Azure for AI cloud (announced Q1 2024); Inovalon for claims data (renewed 2024).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Gem on Call (patient engagement, 2023); no major 2024 deals yet. Potential: Small RCM bolt-ons.\n- **Current Major Clients**: ~700 hospitals/clinics; top undisclosed but rural focus (e.g., Critical Access Hospitals like those in Alabama, Mississippi networks). Represents 40,000 beds.\n- **Potential Clients**: Post-spin-off cross-sell to Evident's 1,200 EHR sites; targeting 200 Medicare Advantage-focused systems.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong rural access mission; low carbon footprint via SaaS.\n- **Management**: CEO Warren Bonham (since 2023) praised for spin-off execution (Seeking Alpha transcripts).\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish on X/StockTwits (post-spin focus); short interest 2.5% (low).\n- **Risks**: Execution on AI; dependency on CMS reimbursements.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy). Strong growth upside from RCM purity/AI (15-20% EPS CAGR est. 2025-27), rural moat undervalued at 4.5x EV/EBITDA vs. peers 10-15x. Moderate risk: Spin-off transition, competition.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $18.50 (72% upside from $10.72). Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($58M guided) + Evident stake value; DCF assumes 10% revenue CAGR, 18% margins. Suitable for growth portfolios (moderate risk via niche stability). Hold if risk-averse; buy on dips below $10.",

(NYSE: DLB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; verified via Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and NYSE data):  \n- **Stock Price**: $72.82  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $7.13 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $66.45 - $94.54  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 17.2 (non-GAAP)  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.6% (annualized $1.20/share)  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nDolby Laboratories, Inc. is a global leader in immersive entertainment technologies, specializing in audio, video, and voice solutions that enhance media experiences across cinemas, homes, mobile devices, automotive, gaming, and cloud platforms. Founded in 1965 by Ray Dolby, the company licenses its proprietary technologies—such as Dolby Atmos (spatial audio), Dolby Vision (HDR imaging), and Dolby TrueHD (lossless audio)—to hardware manufacturers, content creators, and service providers. Revenue is primarily generated through licensing fees (87% of total), with products and services comprising the rest. Dolby operates in two segments: Products (hardware like cinema servers/processors) and Services (content adaptation). With ~2,200 employees worldwide, it holds a dominant position in premium audio-visual standards, powering 90%+ of major Hollywood blockbusters and streaming services. The company benefits from a high-margin, asset-light licensing model but faces cyclicality from consumer electronics and cinema recovery. FY2024 revenue was $1.44 billion, with focus shifting to streaming, automotive infotainment, and AI-enhanced Dolby.io cloud platform for growth amid post-pandemic normalization.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Revenue $353 million (+3% YoY); GAAP net income $64 million (EPS $0.66); non-GAAP EPS $0.81.

Not \"strong growth\" like tech hyperscalers, but undervalued vs. peers (EV/EBITDA 12x vs. sector 15x). Suitable for moderate risk portfolios seeking 15-20% total return via dividends/buybacks.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $85 (17% upside from $72.82). Based on 20x FY2026 non-GAAP EPS $4.50 (analyst consensus), 1.5% yield, and DCF with 4% perpetual growth. Catalysts: Q3 earnings Nov 2024, auto wins.",

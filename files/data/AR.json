Company Overview (AR) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nAntero Resources is an independent oil and gas company that acquires, explores, develops, and produces natural gas, natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\"), and oil in the Appalachian Basin. It is organized in Delaware and headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Antero is one of the largest U.S. suppliers of natural gas and LPG to the global export market.\n\nThe company's reserves are entirely in the Appalachian Basin (92% were in the Marcellus Shale and 8% were in the Utica Shale) and are extracted using hydraulic fracturing. As of December 31, 2021, the company had 17,729 billion cubic feet (502 billion cubic meters) of estimated proved reserves, of which 61% was natural gas, 21% was ethane, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 1% was petroleum. The company is ranked 672nd on the Fortune 500.\n\nThe company was founded in 2002 by Paul M. Rady and Glen C. Warren, Jr. after they sold their previous venture, Pennaco Energy, to Marathon Oil. In October 2013, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $1.5 billion.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Natural Gas and NGLs Production:**\n• It operates in three segments: Exploration and Production; Marketing; and Equity Method Investment in Antero Midstream. As of December 31, 2024, the company had approximately 521,000 net acres in the Appalachian Basin; and approximately 170,000 net acres in the Upper Devonian Shale. Its gathering and compression systems also comprise 708 miles of gas gathering pipelines in the Appalachian Basin.\n\n**Export Capabilities:**\n• In 2024, Antero Resources was responsible for the equivalent of 83 cargoes of LNG being sent to international markets. Approximately 33% of LPG volumes that were exported went to developing countries. In 2024, 24 million barrels of Antero Resources' LPG volumes were shipped to international markets.\n\n**Midstream Integration:**\n• Our contracts with Antero Midstream guarantees Antero access to the midstream services we need to deliver natural gas and NGLs to these premium markets. Antero Midstream provides gathering, compression, and other midstream services, making Antero Resources one of the most integrated natural gas producers in Appalachia.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Dry Gas Development for Data Centers:**\n• Antero added a spot rig to spud a dry gas pad in the fourth quarter of 2025, with no change to its 2025 budget. This pad is expected to turn in line during the first quarter of 2026 and to act as a proof of concept on Antero's ability to quickly increase dry gas activity to supply power for datacenters, other power generation projects or to sell into the local market if local basis were to tighten meaningfully. Antero has approximately 1,000 gross dry gas locations and over 100,000 net acres entirely held-by-production, that could see accelerated activity under these scenarios.\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions Integration:**\n• Antero completed three separate acquisitions, all in its West Virginia development footprint, for approximately $260 million. These transactions include 75-100 MMcfe/d of net production and 10 net undeveloped locations. The acquisitions were funded with a portion of 2025 Free Cash Flow and were acquired at attractive valuations of more than 20% on a 2026 expected Free Cash Flow Yield basis.\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\n**HG Energy Acquisition - Major Strategic Transaction:**\n• Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE: AR) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the upstream assets of HG Energy II, LLC (\"HG Energy\") for total consideration of $2.8 billion in cash plus the assumption of HG Energy's commodity hedge book, subject to customary closing adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, with an effective date of January 1, 2026.\n\n• The deal adds roughly 850 million cubic feet equivalent per day of expected 2026 production and 385,000 net acres in West Virginia's core Marcellus region.\n\n**Expanded Leasing Efforts:**\n• Antero is increasing its land capital budget by $50 million in order to expand its position in the Marcellus Fairway in West Virginia. The Company added 79 incremental drilling locations year-to-date through its organic leasing program at an average cost of approximately $900,000 per location.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program:**\n• During the third quarter 2025, Antero purchased 1.5 million shares for an aggregate $51 million. Year-to-date, Antero has purchased approximately 4.7 million shares for an aggregate $163 million. Antero's share purchases were at a 6% discount to the year-to-date volume weighted average price per share through September 30, 2025.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Global Export Markets:**\n• Our natural gas and natural gas liquids are delivered to customers throughout the world, including many developing nations.\n\n• Antero has firm transportation capacity to sell its propane and butane at the Marcus Hook Export Terminal in Philadelphia, PA. Antero entered into transactions during the second quarter at prices greater than a $0.10 per gallon premium to Mont Belvieu and this premium has further increased in the third quarter.\n\n**Data Center Customers (Emerging Opportunity):**\n• This acquisition adds $10 per share to NAV and offers strategic benefits within West Virginia's growing data center ecosystem.\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Latest Financial Results (Q3 2024):**\n• Antero Resources reported Q3 2024 financial results with net production averaging 3.4 Bcfe/d, a 2% decrease year-over-year. The company posted a net loss of $20 million and Adjusted Net Loss of $37 million.\n\n• Adjusted EBITDAX was $187 million (Non-GAAP); net cash provided by operating activities was $166 million\n\n**Q4 2024 Performance:**\n• Net income was $150 million and Adjusted Net Income was $181 million (Non-GAAP) Adjusted EBITDAX was $332 million (Non-GAAP); net cash provided by operating activities was $278 million\n\n**Current Stock and Market Data:**\n• As of today, Antero Resources Corp market cap is 9.98B.\n• The Antero Resources Corp stock price today is 32.39.\n• With a market cap of 10.61B, Antero Resources(AR) trades at $34.59. The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.29.\n\n**Revenue and Earnings:**\n• The trailing twelve month revenue for Antero Resources is $4.88B. Antero Resources's EPS for 12 months was $1.90.\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Recently, commentary on the US Oil and Gas – Exploration and Production industry highlighted more durable natural gas demand supported by LNG exports and rising power needs, emphasizing that firms like Antero Resources could see more stable cash flows as a result.\n\n• For investors, the rally highlights how quickly fundamentals can change in the natural gas market. While price swings are likely to remain intense, the mix of weather-driven demand and supply sensitivity creates renewed opportunity.\n\n**Operational Efficiency Gains:**\n• Over the last two years, we have reduced the average number of days to drill a well by 20% to just 11 days versus 14 days previously. These meaningful gains result in an efficient maintenance production program that requires just two rigs to maintain 3.3 to 3.4 Bcfe/d of production going forward.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• However, this optimism is tempered by significant near-term risks, particularly regional price volatility caused by pipeline constraints. The Appalachian Basin, where Antero operates, often experiences basis differentials due to limited takeaway capacity, which can depress local prices despite robust national demand.\n\n• Looking ahead to 2025, we are now also deferring a second drilled but uncompleted pad scheduled for completion in early 2025 to later in that year due to low natural gas prices.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n• Today, Antero is one of the largest natural gas and NGL producers in the United States.\n• Expand Energy has solidified itself as the largest natural gas producer in the United States, following the Chesapeake-Southwestern merger. With key assets in the Haynesville and Marcellus basins, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) EXE is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for natural gas, driven by LNG exports, AI/data centers, EV expansion and broader electrification trends.\n• AR is also one of the largest U.S. suppliers of natural gas and LPG to export markets.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n• Companies with significant exposure to natural gas prices and similar operational footprints, such as EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT), Southwestern Energy (NYSE: SWN), and Chesapeake Energy (NASDAQ: CHK), are often seen as direct competitors.\n\n• Coterra Energy, APA, EOG Resources, Chord Energy, and Gulfport Energy are some of the 28 competitors of Antero Resources.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n• Antero Resources is supported by its midstream affiliate, Antero Midstream, in which it owns roughly 29%. This integrated setup secures transportation and market access from Appalachia to the Gulf Coast. A low debt profile and steady drilling results provide flexibility and support long-term growth.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Upcoming Acquisition - HG Energy:**\n• Antero Midstream Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HG II Energy Midstream Holdings, LLC (\"HG Midstream\") from HG Energy II, LLC (\"HG Energy\") for $1.1 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments.

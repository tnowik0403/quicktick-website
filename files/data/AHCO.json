Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAdaptHealth Corp (AHCO) is a leading U.S. provider of home medical equipment (HME), supplies, and related services, primarily serving patients with respiratory issues, sleep apnea, mobility challenges, and vascular conditions. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Morrisville, NC, the company operates through a network of over 1,000 locations across 50 states, delivering personalized care via direct-to-patient models. Core offerings include non-invasive ventilation (e.g., CPAP/BiPAP for sleep therapy), home oxygen therapy, mobility aids (wheelchairs, power mobility), enteral nutrition, and wound care supplies. AdaptHealth emphasizes integrated care pathways, digital patient engagement platforms, and payer-aligned reimbursement strategies to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions.\n\nThe company has grown rapidly through tuck-in acquisitions (over 100 since IPO in 2020), scaling from $700M revenue in 2020 to a $3B+ run-rate. It serves Medicare (60%+ of revenue), Medicaid, and commercial payers, with a focus on high-acuity chronic patients. In a fragmented $20B+ HME market, AdaptHealth holds a top-tier position, benefiting from demographic tailwinds like aging Boomers and home-care shifts. Challenges include reimbursement volatility, but its scale enables tech investments like AI-driven compliance tools.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Revenue $786.6M (+6.1% YoY from verified 10-Q); Gross profit $288.0M (gross margin 36.6%); Net income $11.2M (EPS $0.08, beating estimates); Adjusted EBITDA $136.7M (+11% YoY).

Undervalued at 8x EV/EBITDA vs. 10-12x peers; 10-15% upside on M&A execution, but reimbursement/macro risks cap aggression.

DCF-based (8% WACC, 5% terminal, verified Q2 data + consensus FY25 EPS $0.85); catalysts: Q3 earnings Nov 6, next M&A. Suitable for growth portfolios seeking 20%+ IRR over 12-18 months.",

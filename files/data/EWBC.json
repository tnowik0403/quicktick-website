As of September 30, 2024, the company reported total assets of $72.8 billion, total loans of $49.9 billion, and total deposits of $60.2 billion. EWBC specializes in serving the pan-Asian diaspora, U.S.-China trade corridors, and immigrant communities, with a strong footprint in California (especially Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area), New York, Texas, Washington, and international branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenyang, China. The bank offers a wide range of products including commercial real estate (CRE) loans (39% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (34%), residential mortgages, consumer loans, deposits, wealth management, and treasury management services. EWBC differentiates through its bilingual/multilingual staff, cross-border expertise, and digital platforms tailored to underserved ethnic markets.

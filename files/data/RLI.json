Through its subsidiaries—primarily RLI Insurance Company—it underwrites property and casualty (P&C) insurance products targeting niche, high-risk markets where standard carriers avoid exposure. RLI operates in three segments: Casualty (46% of 2023 gross premiums written), Property (34%), and Surety (20%). Key offerings include commercial liability, excess and surplus (E&S) lines, personal umbrella, inland marine, and contract surety bonds. The company emphasizes disciplined underwriting, maintaining a combined ratio below 100% for 20+ consecutive years, with a focus on rate adequacy and selective risk appetite. RLI distributes via independent agents/brokers (over 4,000 nationwide) and has a strong balance sheet, evidenced by AM Best A+ (Superior) rating. In 2023, gross premiums written reached $1.68 billion (up 17%), driven by E&S growth amid hardening markets.

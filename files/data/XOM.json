Headquartered in Irving, Texas, it explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas; refines and markets transportation fuels, lubricants, and chemicals; and manufactures petrochemicals and specialty products. With operations in 50+ countries, ExxonMobil's Upstream segment drives ~70% of earnings via low-cost Permian Basin production (U.S.) and Guyana's Stabroek Block (world-class discovery). Downstream includes 20+ refineries processing ~4.6 million barrels/day, while Chemical produces olefins, polyolefins, and aromatics for plastics/packaging. In 2023, it generated $344.6 billion in revenue amid volatile energy prices. ExxonMobil emphasizes capital discipline, targeting 20-30% returns on projects, with a pivot toward low-carbon solutions like carbon capture (CCS) and hydrogen, though oil/gas remain core (95%+ of portfolio). Led by CEO Darren Woods since 2017, it returned $35B+ to shareholders in 2023 via dividends/buybacks. Recent $60B Pioneer Natural Resources acquisition (closed May 3, 2024) boosted Permian output to 1.3M boe/d, positioning XOM for OPEC+ supply discipline amid energy transition pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 26, 2024):** Revenue $93.1B (up 1% YoY); net income $9.2B (EPS $2.14); Upstream earnings $6.3B; free cash flow $10.1B.

QatarEnergy (Golden Pass LNG); SK On/LG (lithium).\n- **M&A:** Pioneer ($60B, May 2024); Denbury CCS ($4.9B, 2023); proposed Mobil Venezuela assets revival (Oct 2024 talks).\n- **Major Clients:** Airlines (e.g., Delta fuel contracts); Chem giants (Dow, LyondellBasell offtake); governments (Saudi Aramco refining JVs).\n- **Potential:** Exxon-led CCS hubs with Microsoft/Google for data centers; Permian midstream with Occidental.\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n**Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy for Growth Upside)**  \nRationale: XOM's Permian/Guyana engines deliver 5-7% production CAGR through 2027 at $20B+ FCF/yr; undervalued vs. peers (P/E 13x fwd vs. sector 12x); resilient to $60/bbl downside. Moderate risk via diversification (low-carbon buffer), but oil volatility caps to 10. Upside from M&A, dividends (4% yield).\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $145/share** (20% upside)  \nDCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal, $75/bbl long-term oil): Intrinsic $142-148. Aligns with consensus targets (Goldman $145, JPM $152, Oct 2024). Hold below $130; accumulate on dips.",

Innovative Medicine focuses on high-unmet-need areas like oncology (e.g., Darzalex), immunology (e.g., Stelara, Tremfya), neuroscience (e.g., Spravato), infectious diseases, and cardiovascular/metabolic disorders, with a pipeline of 90+ investigational therapies. MedTech spans orthopaedics (DePuy Synthes), surgical devices (Ethicon), vision care (Acuvue lenses), and interventional solutions, emphasizing minimally invasive procedures and robotics. \n\nIn 2023, JNJ generated $85.2B in sales, divesting consumer products (e.g., Tylenol, Neutrogena) to sharpen focus on innovation-driven growth. The company invests ~$15B annually in R&D (18% of sales), boasts a AAA-rated balance sheet, and has raised dividends for 62 consecutive years. With 135,000 employees across 60+ countries, JNJ serves physicians, hospitals, and patients globally, holding leadership in oncology biologics and elective surgeries. Despite patent cliffs looming, its diversified portfolio and M&A firepower position it for mid-single-digit growth amid aging populations and tech-enabled care.

Potential: Expanded CAR-T with insurers post-label expansions.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy for Hold/Buy)**  \n  Rationale: Resilient fundamentals (5%+ growth ex-Stelara), 3% yield, defensive healthcare moat amid volatility. Q2 beat, pipeline derisking offset litigation. Moderate risk (patent cliffs) balanced by FCF/dividends. Undervalued vs. 5-year avg P/E 18x.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $175/share (12-15% upside).  \n  DCF-based (5% perpetual growth, 8% WACC) using Q2 guidance + analyst consensus (avg target $169 from 15 firms, per Yahoo Finance Oct 2024). Ideal for growth upside (oncology/MedTech) with moderate risk via diversification. Hold current position; add on dips below $150.",

(IQST) is a multifaceted technology company specializing in telecommunications, fintech, and emerging AI solutions, primarily targeting high-growth emerging markets across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, the company operates through four main pillars: International Carrier Services (voice, SMS, and roaming wholesale), Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) deployments (e.g., QXTEL in the U.S. prepaid market), Fintech (including cross-border payments via its STEL platform), and a burgeoning AI division (STEL AI). iQSTEL serves over 800 telecom operators and enterprises in 23 countries, processing 15+ billion minutes of voice traffic and 4+ billion SMS annually. Its growth is fueled by a lean asset-light model, leveraging wholesale infrastructure for rapid scalability. Recent diversification into AI-driven trading systems and defense tech positions it beyond traditional telecom, with ambitions to capture synergies in data monetization and secure communications. In Q2 2024, revenues hit $68.5 million (up 48% YoY), driven by 60% MVNO growth and SMS surges, achieving GAAP net income of $1.7 million—its first profitable quarter. Trading at a forward P/S multiple of ~0.4x (vs. sector avg. 2-3x), IQST offers asymmetric upside for growth investors amid volatile small-cap dynamics.

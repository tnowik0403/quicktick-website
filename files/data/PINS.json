It also offers various advertising products to help advertisers meet users; and ad auction that allows to serve ads to users at relevant moments while optimizing business outcomes for advertisers. Pinterest generates revenue by selling digital ads on its platform. While the platform's user base spans the globe, the vast majority of its revenue stems from ads shown to North American users.

Existing Products/Services\n\nPinterest operates several key product categories:\n- **Core Platform:** Pinterest reaches 600 million monthly active users who save Pins to 15 billion boards, generating a predictive intent signal rooted in what people are planning to do next. Pinterest's AI systems use this signal, together with its Taste Graph, to deliver highly personalized recommendations and shopping experiences\n- **Advertising Solutions:** Over the past few years, Pinterest has leaned into commerce marketing APIs, shoppable ad formats and AI-powered tools for content discovery and ad optimization. One of those tools is Performance+, an AI ad targeting product that Pinterest introduced in 2024 to compete with the likes of Google's Performance Max and Meta's Advantage+\n- **Shopping Features:** Pinterest continues to build out its shopping options, and expand its online marketplace, with a view to becoming the virtual shopping mall for more sectors.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### tvScientific Acquisition (December 2025)\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE: PINS), a leading AI-powered visual search and discovery platform, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire tvScientific, a connected TV (CTV) performance advertising platform. For the first time, Pinterest will combine its intent-rich audience signals with a CTV engine, so marketers can clearly measure how TV lifts the results of their performance ad campaigns. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory review, and is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\n\n### Pinterest Assistant (Launched October 2025)\nThe new Pinterest Assistant uses AI to help users find products and ideas that match their tastes, expanding the platform's long-standing focus on inspiration into one centered on action. The result, according to Pinterest, is a new multimodal search experience that can flow among images, voice input and text.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThis is an exciting progression in our multi-year strategy to drive new sources of demand to Pinterest and begin to allow advertisers to reach our valuable audience beyond our platform. International monetization represents one of our largest, most durable growth factors, and we're still in the very early innings. Today, we have roughly 500 million MAUs outside of UCAN, or 83% of our global users, evidence of our strong global awareness and product-market fit with our users.\n\nKey strategic initiatives include:\n- **AI-Powered Shopping:** For Pinterest, its future hinges on AI-powered shopping. Its algorithm pinpoints products for users based on their searches in the app. In its latest quarter, the number of people clicking on advertiser links grew by 40% compared to the year before and has increased by more than five times in the last three years, according to earnings reports\n- **Connected TV Expansion:** Through the tvScientific acquisition\n- **Partnership Strategy:** Building retail media collaborations\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Current Major Partnerships\n- **Instacart Partnership (June 2025):** Pinterest ads will become directly shoppable via Instacart under a new retail media collaboration between the two companies. This collaboration will enable Pinterest users to complete a purchase in a few clicks and have the items delivered in as little as 30 minutes\n- **Walmart Partnership (December 2025):** Pinterest and Walmart plan to pilot a shoppable recipe experience in the United States and will roll it out over the coming weeks. This collaboration enables Pinterest users to discover recipes on the visual search and discovery platform, tap on ingredients from eligible recipe Pins to add them to their online cart on Walmart's website or app\n- **Amazon Integration:** Pinterest's Amazon partnership allows users to buy Amazon products without leaving Pinterest\n\n### Target Advertisers\nAs an example, advertisers have requested additional transparency regarding the audiences their Performance Plus campaigns are reaching to supplement the performance metrics they already receive. As a result, we recently launched enhanced new reporting functionality in Ads Manager, offering detailed audience breakdowns, including age, gender, and approximate location.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results (Latest)\n- **Revenue:** Revenue was $1,049 million, growing 17% year over year\n- **Adjusted EBITDA:** Pinterest reported Adjusted EBITDA of $306 million for Q3 2025, representing a 24% year-over-year increase and a margin of 29%, up 170 basis points from the previous year. This improvement demonstrates the company's ability to grow revenue while maintaining cost discipline\n- **EPS:** The company's revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $1.049 billion, aligning with forecasts, while EPS fell short at $0.38 compared to the expected $0.43\n- **User Growth:** User growth continued, with 600 million monthly active users, up 12% year-over-year\n\n### Q4 2025 Guidance\nFor Q4 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1,313 million to $1,338 million, representing 14% - 16% growth year over year. We expect Q4 2025 Adjusted EBITDA* to be in the range of $533 million to $558 million.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Tariff Impact:** Donnelly attributed the sales moderation to unspecified \"larger U.S. retailers\" that are dealing with tariff-related issues putting pressure on their margins. Regarding the company's fourth-quarter guidance, Donnelly said that \"we see these broader trends and market uncertainty continuing with the addition of a new tariff in Q4 impacting the home furnishing category.\"\n- **AI Content Quality Issues:** Pinterest, among other social platforms, struggled as the influx of AI-generated content outpaced the ability to vet it. Earlier this year, the app was criticized for allowing a flood of \"AI slop\" on the platform, which it addressed with labeling and giving users new controls to adjust how much AI content could show up on their feeds for certain categories\n- **Stock Performance:** Over the last year, Pinterest's (PINS) shares have lost about 10% of their value amid concerns about the impact of macroeconomic factors and artificial intelligence\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Gen Z Adoption:** According to Pinterest Presents, 39% of Gen Z start their searches on Pinterest instead of traditional search engines\n- **AI Shopping Opportunity:** A recent PYMNTS Intelligence survey showed that almost half of consumers want AI help with shopping. Those numbers jump dramatically for the younger generations\n- **Performance+ Success:** According to Pinterest CRO Bill Watkins, ad impressions grew 41% YOY in Q3 right after Performance+ launched\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe U.S. and Canada region, which still accounts for the majority of revenue, grew at a more modest 9% year-over-year. While U.S. and Canada remains the company's most monetized region with an ARPU of $7.64, the accelerating growth in international markets represents a significant opportunity for Pinterest's future revenue expansion. However, these users represented just 25% of global revenue in Q3 2025, reflecting our historical monetization focus on North American markets.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors\nMeta Platforms, X (Social/Platform Software), Reddit, Dailymotion, and YouTube are some of the 15 competitors of Pinterest. \n\n### Competitive Positioning\nWhile the firm's user count remains markedly below its larger social media peer Meta, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to increase its share within digital advertising budgets by leveraging e-commerce features and ads on its platform, thus increasing ad monetization. We view Pinterest as a differentiated player that has carved out a niche in a crowded digital advertising market.\n\n### Differentiation Strategy\nThis means the company holds valuable search data and serves as a gateway for purchase intent. Pinterest views the marriage of this unique data with tvScientific's platform as a win: For the first time, Pinterest will combine its intent-rich audience signals with a CTV engine, so marketers can clearly measure how TV lifts the results of their performance ad campaigns.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent M&A Activity\n- **tvScientific Acquisition (December 2025):** Pinterest has done a handful of deals over the past decade, but this marks its first deal since 2022, when the firm bought The Yes, an AI-driven shopping app. One source, who declined to be named to maintain relationships, estimated the deal valuation was in the range of $300-to-$350 million\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\n- **Instacart (June 2025):** Retail media collaboration for shoppable ads\n- **Walmart (December 2025):** Shoppable recipe experience\n- **Amazon:** Product integration allowing purchases without leaving Pinterest\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### October-December 2025 Key Developments\n- **Pinterest Assistant Launch (October 2025):** AI-powered shopping assistant with voice capabilities\n- **tvScientific Acquisition Announcement (December 2025):** Entry into connected TV advertising\n- **Walmart Partnership (December 2025):** Shoppable recipes pilot program\n\n### Q3 2025 Earnings Impact\nPinterest shares tanked nearly 20% on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed on earnings per share and provided weak guidance. However, Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) reported a 17% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2025, reaching $1.049 billion. The company achieved a record high of 600 million monthly active users, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of user growth.\n\n## 13.

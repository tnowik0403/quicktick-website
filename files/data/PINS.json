(PINS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, market close - sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $29.14\n- Market Capitalization: $19.84 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $23.68 - $45.185\n- Trailing P/E: N/A (GAAP unprofitable)\n- Forward P/E: 24.88\n- EV/EBITDA: 28.45\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE: PINS) operates a visual discovery and inspiration platform where over 500 million monthly active users (MAUs) save, search, and shop ideas through \"Pins\" organized into personalized boards. Founded in 2010, it has evolved from a simple image-sharing site into an AI-powered commerce engine, blending social media, search, and e-commerce. The platform excels in high-intent discovery, particularly among women (over 70% of users) and Gen Z (40% of U.S. users), focusing on categories like fashion, home decor, recipes, and travel. Monetization relies on advertising (98% of revenue), including Promoted Pins, Shopping Ads, and Outbrain partnerships, with emerging direct commerce via \"Buyable Pins.\" In Q2 2024, Pinterest reported 522 million global MAUs (+12% YoY) and $855.1 million in revenue (+21% YoY), driven by ARPU growth (8% to $1.64) amid international expansion (non-U.S. revenue +30% YoY). Challenges include U.S. MAU stagnation and competition from visual-heavy rivals, but investments in generative AI (e.g., AI-generated Pins) and shoppable features position it for e-commerce tailwinds.

(KFS) is a Canadian-based holding company (headquartered in Toronto, Ontario) specializing in niche insurance and warranty products, primarily in the U.S. non-standard auto insurance market. Founded in 1989, it operates through three main segments: Extended Warranty (vehicle service contracts, GAP products, and commercial truck warranties via subsidiaries like Kingsway America and IWS International), Insurance Underwriting (non-standard personal and commercial auto insurance through Affirmative Insurance and MNQ Agency), and Investment & Other (legacy investments and corporate activities).  \n\nWith ~$60 million in annual revenue (FY2023), KFS focuses on acquiring underperforming warranty administrators and insurers, optimizing operations via cost cuts and technology, and leveraging a $150+ million investment portfolio for yield. The company targets fragmented markets where scale is limited, emphasizing high-margin extended warranties (70-80% gross margins historically). Recent pivots include exiting low-margin P&C underwriting and doubling down on warranties post-2022 strategic review.

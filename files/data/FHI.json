(FHI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $38.42 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.22 billion (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $33.35 - $40.89  \n**Sources:** Company filings (SEC EDGAR), Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript (July 25, 2024, via Seeking Alpha), Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Reuters, Morningstar, company investor relations site (federatedhermes.com), recent articles from Barron's (Sept 2024), CNBC (Aug 2024), and WSJ (Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFederated Hermes, Inc. (FHI) is a leading global investment management firm headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, founded in 1955. The company provides a broad range of asset management solutions, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts, and alternative investment products, with a strong emphasis on active management, fixed income, money market funds, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies. As of June 30, 2024, FHI managed $675.4 billion in assets under management (AUM), serving both institutional and retail clients across the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Key strengths include its position as the #1 ranked active prime money market fund complex (per Crane Data, as of Sept 2024) and a growing focus on sustainable investing, with over $100 billion in ESG-dedicated assets. FHI generates revenue primarily through management fees (83% of Q2 2024 revenue), administrative service fees, and performance-based incentives. The firm operates through subsidiaries like Federated Investors and Hermes Investment Management (acquired in 2017), enabling a boutique-like approach within a scalable platform. Recent market volatility has bolstered its money market funds, which comprise ~40% of AUM, while equity and alternatives segments drive long-term growth. FHI trades at a forward P/E of ~10x (below sector avg. 14x), reflecting value amid active management headwinds, but its high-margin money market business and international expansion position it for steady compounding.

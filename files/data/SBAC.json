Headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, SBA primarily leases space on its towers and rooftops to wireless service providers, broadcasters, and other tenants for antennas and related equipment. As of June 30, 2024, the company owns and/or operates approximately 39,649 communication sites across 16 markets, including 17,464 domestic sites in the U.S. and Central America, and 22,185 international sites primarily in Brazil and South Africa.  \n\nSBAC generates revenue through long-term leases (average remaining term ~7 years), with a focus on recurring cash flows from organic growth driven by new tenant additions, amendments (upgrades like 5G), and escalators (typically 3% annual). The company benefits from a fragmented tower market, high barriers to entry due to zoning and capital intensity, and secular tailwinds from rising mobile data demand. Domestic revenue accounts for ~65% of total, with international exposure providing diversification but higher volatility. SBAC converted to a REIT in 2012, distributing 90%+ of taxable income as dividends. It emphasizes capital recycling via asset sales (e.g., non-core divestitures) to fund U.S. acquisitions and share repurchases. With a BBB- credit rating, SBAC maintains a conservative balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~5.5x). The firm has delivered ~10-12% annualized total returns over the past decade, positioning it as a pure-play infrastructure play amid 5G densification and edge computing trends.

Consensus analyst estimates (Yahoo Finance, Oct 2024): Revenue CAGR 3.5% (2024-2026).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | SBAC | American Tower (AMT) | Crown Castle (CCI) |\n|----------------------------|------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Total Sites** | 39,649 | 225,000+ (global) | 40,000 (U.S.) |\n| **Rev Growth (YoY)** | +2% | +2% | -20% (post-fiber impairment) |\n| **AFFO/Share Growth** | +5% | +3% | -5% |\n| **Net Debt/EBITDA** | 5.5x | 5.8x | 6.2x |\n| **EV/EBITDA Multiple** | 20x | 22x | 18x |\n| **Strengths vs. Peers** | Highest organic growth; pure tower focus | Global scale | U.S. fiber integration |\n\nSBAC outperforms on margins/growth but trades at premium to CCI due to cleaner balance sheet.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Multi-year master leases with Verizon (2023 renewal), AT&T (2022), T-Mobile (ongoing 5G amendments).\n- **M&A**: $92M U.S. tower acquisitions Q1-Q2 2024; $1.1B South Africa portfolio sale closed March 2024. Pipeline: $300-500M U.S. buys targeted H2 2024.\n- **Major Clients** (Top 10: 75% revenue): Verizon (25%), AT&T (20%), T-Mobile (15%). Potential: DISH Network expansion; enterprise (e.g., AWS edge pilots).\n- **Other**: JVs with carriers for shared infrastructure.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top REIT sustainability score (S&P 2024); 50% sites powered by renewables.\n- **Management**: CEO Brendan Cavanagh (since 2020) track record of 15%+ IRR on deals.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (FCC tower permitting delays); FX in Brazil (15% revenue).\n- **Opportunities**: Private equity tower sales (e.g., Vantage Towers analogs); C-band/ mmWave densification.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy).

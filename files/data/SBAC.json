Unlike public 5G networks owned and operated by carriers and made available to the general public, a Private 5G network by SBA provides a dedicated and secure communication infrastructure that can be tailored to your organization's specific needs.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nSBA Communications' growth strategy focuses on several key pillars:\n\n**Geographic Expansion:**\nSBA Communications is simultaneously exiting subscale international markets (Canada, Philippines, Colombia) while scaling aggressively in Central America through the 7,000-tower Millicom (TIGO) acquisition, creating a more focused, higher-growth portfolio that trades near-term disruption for long-term compounding. SBA Communications (SBAC +0.18%) completed the Central American Millicom acquisition—delayed modestly by regulatory processes—and divested its Canadian tower business earlier than anticipated, resulting in a portfolio that now exceeds 46,000 global sites.\n\n**Infrastructure Development:**\nCarrier activity levels in the US continued to grow and we finished 2024 with our highest backlogs of the year for both leasing and services, setting us up well for continued momentum in 2025. In 2023, SBA Communications constructed 1,275 new communication towers across multiple markets.\n\n**Operational Excellence:**\nSBA trimmed leverage while automating site audits and deploying AI-based maintenance, aiming to widen margins despite higher interest expense.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Wireless Carriers:**\nSBA's client base is concentrated among major wireless carriers:\n- SBA Communications has established strong relationships with major MNOs, including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, ensuring high tower occupancy rates\n- Verizon and SBA Communications have announced a new long-term agreement, securing a favorable framework that will drive significant cost certainty and support the continued expansion of Verizon's world-class 4G and 5G services. This new agreement provides the flexibility needed for Verizon to be more nimble in managing its current infrastructure asset portfolio and deploying new technologies\n\n**International Partnerships:**\n- Millicom and SBA Communications, which significantly enhances the longstanding relationship enjoyed between our companies\n- Millicom, under the Tigo brand, will lease back space on these towers for 15 years, ensuring steady cash flow for SBA\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Earnings (Q4 2024):**\n- Net income of $178.8 million or $1.61 per share Industry-leading AFFO per share of $3.47 Quarter-ending Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio lowest in company history\n- Q3 FY25 · Revenue 732.33M · Earnings 236.82M\n\n**Dividend Growth:**\n- its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.11 per share of the Company's Class A Common Stock, an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter. The distribution is payable March 27, 2025 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2025\n\n**Financial Metrics:**\n- Additionally, SBA ended 2024 with their net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 6.1 times, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which supports ongoing investments and shareholder returns through dividends and potential share repurchases\n- SBA Communications Corporation generated $2,192.7 million in tower leasing revenue for the fiscal year 2023\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Headwinds:**\n- International churn remains elevated due to customer consolidation, impacting cash flows and organic growth. The macro interest rate environment and a strong dollar have hindered stock performance\n- Continued churn from Sprint merger negatively impacts revenues, with significant churn expected in 2025 and 2026. Management expects approximately $50 million in Sprint churn for 2026 and $20 million thereafter, indicating ongoing headwinds\n- This churn effect is compounded by foreign exchange headwinds, which are expected to negatively impact site leasing revenue by approximately $25 million in 2025\n\n**Key Tailwinds:**\n- SBA Communications is not a consumer brand, but its towers, small cells, and edge sites quietly power the mobile networks behind 5G, private wireless, and the coming 6G era\n- 5G upgrades require more antennas and often heavier equipment on each tower. AI and edge workloads push demand for more localized, capacity-focused sites\n- Crown Castle's recent $5.2 billion investment in 5G infrastructure highlights its commitment to maintaining technological leadership indicating strong industry investment trends that benefit SBA\n\n**Stabilization Expected:**\nWhile domestic Sprint (TMUS) consolidation will cause $51 million in 2025 churn and international markets face elevated consolidation-related terminations (particularly Oi (OIBR) in Brazil), management's guidance and commentary point to a \"significant step down\" in churn by 2026, suggesting organic growth is poised to accelerate materially once these legacy issues clear.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**US Market Position:**\nThere are three main players in the wireless tower space: $86-billion market value American Tower, $53-billion Crown Castle International—both structured as real-estate investment trusts, or REITs—and $23 billion SBA Communications (SBAC).\n\n**Market Share Dynamics:**\nIndependent tower companies dominated the United States telecom towers market with a 75.48% share in 2024. American Tower generated USD 10.1 billion in revenue in 2024 on 149,000 global sites, underscoring its pricing leverage. Crown Castle sold USD 8.5 billion of fiber assets in March 2025 to sharpen its tower focus and deleverage.\n\n**International Positioning:**\nIn many central American Markets SBA Communications is now a leading towerco,and is the number one across the region. Particularly in Guatemala, Tigo's most profitable market, SBA Communications has a lead against its competitors' market share.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**American Tower Corporation:**\n- In 2023, the company reported revenues of $6.34 billion vs SBA's $2.63 billion\n- The company's vast global footprint, encompassing approximately 225,000 communications sites as of early 2024\n\n**Crown Castle:**\n- With a portfolio encompassing over 40,000 cell towers and an extensive fiber network spanning 85,000 route miles, Crown Castle has positioned itself as a crucial player in the 5G revolution. The company's strategic focus on small cell networks has proven particularly prescient, with over 115,000 small cell nodes either operational or under development\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nSBA has steadily grown by acquiring small tower portfolios, while As the smallest among the top 3 US tower companies, SBA missed out on large tower portfolios acquired by Crown and ATC a decade ago. Expect continued international expansion and acquisitions of smaller tower portfolios in the US.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Acquisitions:**\n- The US$975mn transaction is expected to generate substantial financial returns for SBA Communications. According to the company, the newly acquired sites will generate an estimated US$129mn in revenue and US$89mn in tower cash flow during the first full year of operation\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\n- Verizon Master Lease Agreement (MLA) -- New long-term deal with minimum colocation commitment for next ten years; both colocation and amendment components\n- As part of the deal, SBA also secured a seven-year exclusivity agreement to provide additional infrastructure services to Millicom\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q4 2024 Results (February 2025):**\n\"We had a solid finish to 2024, producing favorable results both financially and operationally,\" commented Brendan Cavanagh, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Carrier activity levels in the US continued to grow and we finished 2024 with our highest backlogs of the year for both leasing and services, setting us up well for continued momentum in 2025.\n\n**Investment Grade Rating:**\nFitch initiated BBB- ratings at the corporate and issuer levels, SBA Communications (SBAC +0.18%)'s second investment-grade rating. Fitch assigned a new BBB- investment-grade rating, reflecting a strategic shift to a 6%-7% target leverage range.\n\n**Portfolio Optimization:**\nCanada Market Exit: SBA announced the sale of its tower business in Canada, where it has operated since 2009. The sale is expected to close in Q4 2025 and will be immediately accretive to AFFO per share.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nSBA Communications presents a solid investment opportunity with strong long-term fundamentals despite near-term headwinds. The company benefits from the secular growth in wireless data demand, 5G deployment, and network densification requirements. The Millicom acquisition strategically positions SBA as the leading tower operator in Central America, while the Verizon master lease agreement provides predictable growth over the next decade.\n\nHowever, the company faces significant churn from Sprint decommissioning and international market consolidation, expected to impact performance through 2026. Foreign exchange headwinds and elevated interest rates present additional challenges. The stock trades at a premium valuation (P/E of 25.3x) relative to the current earnings trajectory.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $215**\n\nBased on the current analyst consensus target of $232.50 and considering the company's:\n- Strong market position and recurring revenue model\n- Expected revenue growth from 5G deployment and network densification\n- Strategic acquisitions enhancing market leadership\n- Near-term churn headwinds moderating by 2026\n- Investment-grade credit rating and strong balance sheet\n- Dividend growth track record\n\nThe fair value estimate reflects a balanced view of the company's solid fundamentals tempered by current operational challenges, suggesting modest upside potential from current trading levels around $182.",

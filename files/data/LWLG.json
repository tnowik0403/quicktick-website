Company Overview\n\nLightwave Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ: LWLG) is a technology platform company leveraging its proprietary engineered electro-optic (EO) polymers known as Perkinamine, to transmit data at higher speeds with less power in a small form factor. The company develops next-generation Electro-Optic polymers which increase the efficiency of internet infrastructure by allowing more data to be transmitted at significantly higher speeds and with less power than existing solutions. Founded in 1991 and headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, the company was formerly known as Third-order Nanotechnologies, Inc. and changed its name to Lightwave Logic, Inc. in March 2008.\n\nThe company focuses on the development of photonic devices and electro-optical polymer materials systems for fiber-optic data communications, telecommunications, and optical computing markets in the United States. It is involved in the designing and synthesizing of organic chromophores for use in its electro-optic polymer systems and photonic device designs. It offers electro-optic modulators, which convert data from electric signals to optical signals for transmission over fiber-optic cables; and polymer photonic integrated circuits, a photonic device, which integrates various photonic circuits on a single chip.\n\n## 2.

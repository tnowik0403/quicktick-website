(CPSS), founded in 1991 and headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, is a specialty finance company focused on indirect vehicle financing for subprime and non-prime borrowers. The company purchases retail installment sales contracts (RSCs) originated by franchised and independent auto dealers nationwide for new and used vehicles, primarily targeting customers with credit scores below 620. CPSS originates loans through a network of over 10,000 active dealers across 48 states, emphasizing a high-volume, low-cost model supported by proprietary underwriting software and advanced data analytics for credit risk assessment. \n\nAs of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), CPSS managed a portfolio of approximately $2.33 billion in receivables, with a weighted average APR of 20.5% and an average FICO score of 535. The company securitizes ~90% of its portfolio through asset-backed securities (ABS) transactions, issuing 10-12 deals annually rated by agencies like S&P and Fitch. This structure allows efficient funding via the capital markets, with gains on sale recognized upfront. CPSS reported static pool net loss rates stabilizing at 10.2% for recent vintages, reflecting improved underwriting amid economic pressures. Revenue is driven by finance charges, servicing fees, and securitization gains, positioning CPSS as a niche player in the $1.2 trillion U.S. auto finance market, where subprime lending comprises ~20-25% of originations.

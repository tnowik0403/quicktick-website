(TLSI) is a medical technology company specializing in oncology therapeutics, primarily targeting primary liver and pancreatic cancers. Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, the company leverages its proprietary Pressure-Enabled Drug Delivery™ (PEDD™) platform to overcome barriers in tumor microenvironments, enhancing drug penetration and immune response. This technology is delivered via specialized devices like the TriSalus SmartValve®, which enables precise pressure-enabled hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) for liver-directed therapies.\n\nTLSI's commercial focus is on its Pancreatic Delivery System (PDS) and liver cancer treatments, with investigational assets like SD-101 (immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and SD-301 (novel IL-12 immunotherapy). The company went public via a SPAC merger with MedTech Acquisition Corp in August 2022. Revenue is generated from device sales (e.g., SmartValve) and growing procedure volumes in U.S. interventional radiology centers. TLSI operates in the $2-3B global liver-directed therapy market, emphasizing minimally invasive approaches amid rising liver cancer incidence (projected 20% CAGR through 2030 per Grand View Research).

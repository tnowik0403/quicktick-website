The company provides a full suite of banking, mortgage banking, and wealth management services across the Southeast U.S., with a strong footprint in Tennessee (its core market), Alabama, and expanding into Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. FirstBank operates 81 full-service banking offices as of Q3 2024, emphasizing relationship-based community banking for small and middle-market businesses, professionals, and consumers.\n\nFBK differentiates through its \"High Performance Bank\" model, focusing on high-quality loans (e.g., owner-occupied commercial real estate, healthcare lending), disciplined deposit growth, and fee income from mortgage origination and wealth management. Unlike larger national banks, FBK avoids heavy reliance on non-relationship lending, maintaining a conservative balance sheet with low charge-offs (0.12% non-performing loans as of Q3 2024). In 2023, it generated $702.6 million in total revenue, with mortgage banking contributing ~20-25% historically, though shifting toward core banking amid high rates. The company has grown organically and via tuck-in acquisitions, increasing assets from $10.7B in 2020 to $14.2B as of September 30, 2024. Led by CEO Eric Bolin (since 2023), FBK targets affluent markets and healthcare sectors, positioning for de novo expansion and digital enhancements.

(NASDAQ: SFIX) is a leading online personal styling and apparel discovery platform founded in 2011 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company uses a proprietary combination of data science, machine learning algorithms, and human stylists to deliver personalized clothing \"Fixes\" – curated boxes of 5 apparel items shipped directly to customers based on an initial Style Profile questionnaire and ongoing feedback. Customers try on items at home, keep what they like (paying only for kept items), and return the rest free of charge. Revenue is generated primarily from merchandise sales, with a subscription-like model for recurring Fixes.\n\nStitch Fix serves women (core ~70% of revenue), men (~25%), kids, and plus-size segments, partnering with over 200 brands like 7 for All Mankind, Madewell, and Theory. It has shipped over 100 million Fixes to 13 million+ lifetime clients. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended November 2, 2024), it had 2.7 million active clients. The company leverages a massive dataset (billions of data points) for personalization, positioning itself in the $100B+ U.S. women's apparel market amid e-commerce growth.

PT $3.50).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell) – Deep value at 0.2x EV/Sales, but persistent revenue declines and client loss outweigh turnaround hopes. Moderate risk appetite sees limited near-term catalysts.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $4.50 (88% upside) – Based on 0.5x FY2026E sales ($1.6B revenue at +5% growth), 40% gross margins, EBITDA breakeven.

Strong robotics tailwinds and 15%+ EBITDA margins support growth (8-10% EPS CAGR 2024-2026), but CEO transition and EMEA drag moderate upside. At $106, trades at 16x 2025E EPS (peer avg 14x); undervalued for growth portfolio with moderate risk.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $125 (17% upside). Based on 18x 2025E EPS ($7.00, per Q2 guidance/analyst consensus) + modest robotics premium; DCF implies $120-130 assuming 4% sales growth, 15% margins.",

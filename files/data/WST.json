The company's dominant market position, exposure to high-growth GLP-1 markets, strong financial performance, and regulatory moat provide compelling investment characteristics. While the stock trades at a premium valuation, the secular growth trends in biologics and injectables, combined with West's irreplaceable position in the pharmaceutical supply chain, justify the premium.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $355-365**\n\nGiven the analyst consensus around $347-350 and considering the strong fundamentals, growth prospects in GLP-1 markets, and dominant competitive position, a fair value range of $355-365 represents reasonable upside from current levels while accounting for execution risks and market volatility.",

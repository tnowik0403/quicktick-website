(NYSE: WST) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 31, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $253.44\n- Market Capitalization: $18.37 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $194.88 - $368.68\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 39.2x\n- Dividend Yield: 0.35% (Annual Dividend: $0.88/share)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nWest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (WST) is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing advanced injectable packaging and containment solutions, as well as delivery systems for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, with ~11,000 employees across 50+ locations in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, West specializes in elastomeric components (e.g., stoppers, seals, plungers), rigid container systems (e.g., vials, cartridges), and prefillable syringe systems. Its proprietary Crystal Zenith® polymer-based syringes and Vials/Closures are engineered for biologics, vaccines, and high-value injectables, minimizing particulates and enabling self-administration via autoinjectors and pens.\n\nThe company operates in two segments: Proprietary Products (81% of 2023 revenue, focused on differentiated systems like SmartDose® and Crystal Zenith®) and Contract-Manufactured Products (19%, standard packaging). West benefits from sticky, long-term relationships with top pharma firms, with ~70% of revenue from biologics/subcutaneous delivery. In 2023, it generated $2.95B in revenue, driven by demand for GLP-1 therapies (e.g., Ozempic®), oncology drugs, and vaccines. However, 2024 has seen softness from customer destocking post-COVID highs, though long-term tailwinds from aging populations, chronic disease prevalence, and biologics shift persist.

Moderate risk appetite suits waiting for trough earnings (H1 2025 recovery). Avoid buy below $240.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $320/share** (30% upside; DCF-based: 10% CAGR revenue to 2028, 42% terminal margins, 9% WACC. Aligns with sum-of-parts: Proprietary 25x P/E, CMP 15x). Catalysts: Q4 backlog conversion, Ireland ramp.",

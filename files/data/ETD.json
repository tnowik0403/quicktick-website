Headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut, Edgewell operates in over 50 countries, with a portfolio of trusted brands generating ~$2.3 billion in annual net sales (FY2024). Its flagship Wet Shave segment (61% of FY2024 sales) includes Schick and Wilkinson Sword razors and blades, holding a strong position in the premium and value segments against dominant rival Gillette. Sun & Skin Care (29% of sales) features Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreens, OFF! insect repellents, and British Sterling men's grooming—though this segment is being divested. Feminine Care (10% of sales) comprises Playtex tampons and Stayfree pads. \n\nHistorically spun off from Energizer in 2015, Edgewell has pursued portfolio optimization through M&A (e.g., Billie acquisition in 2021) and divestitures. Recent strategic shifts emphasize higher-margin shave products amid inflationary pressures and category slowdowns. With a debt load targeted for reduction post-divestiture, Edgewell aims to return ~50% of post-tax proceeds to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The company benefits from a robust supply chain, innovation in sustainable packaging, and e-commerce growth (20%+ of sales), but faces headwinds from private label erosion and DTC disruptors. Post its transformative Sun & Skin Care sale (announced June 10, 2024), Edgewell is positioned as a leaner, shave-focused player with enhanced financial flexibility.

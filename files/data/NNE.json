Its transportability via road, rail, sea, and air ensures adaptability for diverse deployment scenarios and supports scalability through interconnected systems to meet greater energy demands.\n\n• **Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain**: Advanced Fuel Transportation Inc. (AFT), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is led by former executives from the largest transportation company in the world aiming to build a North American transportation company that will provide commercial quantities of HALEU fuel to small modular reactors, microreactor companies, national laboratories, military, and DOE programs. Through NANO Nuclear, AFT is the exclusive licensee of a patented high-capacity HALEU fuel transportation basket developed by three major U.S. national nuclear laboratories and funded by the Department of Energy.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n• **Construction Permit Application**: Nano Nuclear is targeting an NRC construction permit application for Q1 2026, with an expedited licensing process expected.\n\n• **University of Illinois Partnership**: Advanced KRONOS MMR™ toward licensing activities with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and construction and eventual deployment of the first KRONOS reactor prototype at the University of Illinois (U of I). Executed a key collaboration agreement to build out our first KRONOS MMR™ at the U of I.\n\n• **Space Applications**: NANO Nuclear Space Inc. (NNS), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is exploring the potential commercial applications of NANO Nuclear's developing micronuclear reactor technology in space. NNS is focusing on applications such as the LOKI MMR™ system and other power systems for extraterrestrial projects and human sustaining environments, and potentially propulsion technology for long haul space missions.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nNANO Nuclear's growth strategy centers on vertical integration across the nuclear fuel supply chain and strategic partnerships:\n\n• **Vertical Integration**: Continuing advancement of commercial vertical integration efforts to participate in key aspects of the nuclear fuel supply chain, a corporate goal which distinguishes NANO Nuclear from its competitors.\n\n• **Strategic Partnerships**: Recent MOUs with major companies including DS Dansuk Co., Ltd., a company listed on the Seoul Stock Exchange, to collaborate on developing and deploying micro modular reactor systems in South Korea and Ameresco (NYSE: AMRC) on January 12, 2026 to explore integrating NANO Nuclear's KRONOS MMR™, ZEUS™, and LOKI MMR™ modular microreactors with Ameresco's EPC capabilities.\n\n• **Market Positioning**: AI data centers are projected to be the primary driver of significantly higher electricity usage in the coming years, and a lack of sufficient transmission infrastructure is expected to constrain the traditional grid's capacity to meet forecasted power growth, with even conservative growth estimates expected to require substantial grid expansion.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n• **Federal and Defense**: The company has cultivated deep ties within the national security apparatus, securing a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for a project at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. The collaboration targets federal customers and commercial markets including data centers, industrial users, and utilities.\n\n• **International Markets**: The MOU specifically supports South Korea's emerging \"One Factory, One MMR\" strategy—an approach aimed at co-locating clean nuclear microreactors directly at industrial sites to provide secure, always-on energy without burdening the national grid.\n\n• **Data Centers and Industrial**: In terms of applications, Oklo is strategically focused on markets that require reliable, carbon-free power. Examples here include data centers and defense.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n• **Cash Position**: Cash position of approximately $580 million following an October 2025 private placement providing net proceeds of approximately $379 million. The company ended fiscal 2025 with $203.3 million in cash, bolstered by a post-fiscal year private placement that raised the total to $580 million.\n\n• **Financial Performance**: Despite a net loss of $40.1 million, up $30 million from the prior year, investors reacted positively to the company's technological and operational progress.\n\n• **R&D Investment**: Nano Nuclear Energy has invested nearly $11.3 million in research and development in the first nine months of 2025.\n\n• **Capital Raising**: Raising over $600 million from a growing number of prominent institutional investors.

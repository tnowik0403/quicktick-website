Market Shares\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global small modular reactor market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of about 4.98% from 2025 to 2032. Pure-play small modular reactor stocks offer the most direct exposure to the technology's potential but also carry the highest risk. Many are pre- or early-revenue, navigating regulatory and first-of-a-kind engineering hurdles where not all will survive. Currently, there's one publicly traded pure-play (NuScale), alongside several key private players.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. NuScale Power (SMR):\nNuScale is the only company that holds Standard Design Approvals from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for its SMRs, with NRC approval for its 50 MWe design in January 2023 and its 77 MWe design in May 2025. NuScale Power has critical first-mover advantage with its VOYGR power plant based on pressurized light-water reactor technology, with each power module generating 77 MWe for scalable plants up to 924 MWe.\n\nNuScale Power's revenues are still very small, with $8.2 million reported for the third quarter of 2025, and the company paid $128.5 million to ENTRA1 during the third quarter as part of its milestone agreement.\n\n### vs. Oklo (OKLO):\nOklo's flagship product, the Aurora, is a much smaller microreactor that only generates 1.5 MWe of power. These tiny microreactors can be chained together in bigger deployments that generate 15 to 100 MWe. Oklo recently announced an upsized 75 MWe design to meet surging demand from AI data centers.\n\nOklo isn't expected to generate any revenue until it deploys its first reactors in Idaho in late 2027 or early 2028. Analysts expect it to rack up net losses of $66 million in 2025 and $78 million in 2026. Yet its market value sits at $10.2 billion -- which is more than 762 times the $13 million in revenue it's expected to generate in 2027.\n\n### Competitive Positioning:\nNANO Nuclear's CEO stated: \"Our lead KRONOS MMR reactor project continues to demonstrate a compelling value proposition in the advanced nuclear landscape. Because our design is rooted in proven high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology using validated TRISO fuel, an inert helium coolant, and well-understood graphite moderation — we are benefitting from decades of operating data that we believe materially reduce technical and licensing risk.\"\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Key Acquisitions:\nNANO Nuclear acquired the patented KRONOS MMR™ Energy System in January 2025, a microreactor with a high technology readiness level (TRL) that benefitted from previous substantial investment over an 8-year period.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships:\nAffiliate LIST and NANO were designated as contractor and subcontractor, respectively, for the Department of Energy's $3.4B Low Enrichment Uranium Acquisition Program.\n\n### Academic Collaborations:\nThe company maintains connections within key U.S. government agencies, including the DOE, the INL and ORNL, and important collaborations with leading researchers from the Cambridge Nuclear Energy Centre and The University of California, Berkeley.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### January 2026:\n- NANO Nuclear announced its participation in Needham's 28th Annual Growth Conference on Tuesday, January 13, 2026.\n- The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted NANO Nuclear's motion to dismiss the putative securities class action lawsuit. The Court dismissed all claims against all defendants on January 8, 2026, following the dismissal of a related shareholder derivative lawsuit announced in April 2025.\n\n### December 2025 - January 2026:\n- NANO Nuclear signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to continue developing a nuclear reactor on campus (announced New Year's Eve).\n- The U.S. House of Representatives will focus on nuclear power in the New Year, with the House Energy Subcommittee holding hearings on nuclear power plant deployment. Regulatory red tape may be cut, and new implementing regulations passed to advance President Trump's executive orders promoting nuclear energy.\n\n### Market Performance:\nNANO Nuclear Energy stock surged 12% on January 2, 2026, following the University of Illinois announcement. The stock continued rising in early 2026, surging 13.8% on January 6, 2026.\n\n## 12.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The data center sector remains among the most favored real estate asset classes due to insatiable tenant demand, limited supply and rising rents.\n- For real estate capital markets, the environment strengthened notably in the second half of 2025 and momentum is expected to build further in 2026. Over the next year we anticipate the competitiveness of investor bidding to rise further as the real estate investment cycle gains momentum, resulting in an expansion of transaction volumes through the year.\n- Demand tailwinds for office overall continue, as company downsizing rates are stabilizing. Companies are also no longer shedding very much space when they relocate; That is now down to 3%, according to JLL, a clear sign of stabilization.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- The average wait time for a grid connection across the U.S. is now four years. Power delays remain a significant hurdle in alleviating supply constraints.\n- In the office sector, development is at an all-time low in the U.S., with completions set to fall by 75% in 2026 and three-quarters of the remaining pipeline already pre-leased. New construction starts in Europe are at their lowest levels since 2010, and deliveries are projected to decline by 5% next year. Supply shortages of top-quality offices will be particularly acute in cities like Tokyo, New York and London.\n\n## 9.

(NASDAQ: EWCZ) is the leading franchised provider of premium waxing services and clean beauty products in the United States. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Plano, Texas, the company operates a network of over 240 studios across 27 states as of Q2 FY2024 (ended June 29, 2024). Its proprietary Comfort Wax® formulation—a hard wax that encapsulates hair for efficient, less painful removal—is applied in a hygienic, self-service manner by trained estheticians, differentiating it from traditional strip-wax methods. EWCZ's business model is asset-light, with ~85% of studios franchised, generating recurring revenue from royalties (typically 6% of sales), advertising fees, and IT reimbursements, alongside sales from company-owned studios (~15% of the network) and its EWC Clean Beauty retail product line (lotions, serums, masks sold in-studio and online). The company targets middle- to upper-middle-income women aged 18-45, emphasizing a membership model (Wax Pass) for recurring visits. In FY2023, system-wide sales reached $951M, with product sales comprising ~20% of studio revenue. EWCZ went public in October 2021 via IPO, raising $287M. Despite a dominant position in professional waxing, it faces cyclical consumer pressures but benefits from high customer loyalty (average 5.5 visits/year per member) and 95%+ gross margins on products.

Opened 39 net new in FY2023; focus on Sun Belt (TX, FL, CA ~50% of units).\n- **Membership Optimization**: Enhance Wax Pass (80% of sales); AI-driven personalization pilots announced Q2 2024 call.\n- **Product Diversification**: Grow EWC Clean Beauty to 25% of SWS (from 20%); DTC e-commerce expansion.\n- **International Entry**: First Canadian studio signed (Toronto, opening H1 2025); testing Puerto Rico.\n- **Digital/Tech**: App upgrades for bookings/loyalty; $5M IT spend in FY2024.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Elevated membership churn (Q2 +200bps YoY); insider selling; high debt ($379M term loan, 8.5% rate). | Strong brand loyalty (NPS 85+); 95% product gross margins; asset-light model (FCF $40M+ FY2023). |\n| **Sector (Beauty/Personal Care)** | Consumer slowdown (middle-income spending down 5-10% per Nielsen Aug 2024); at-home waxing/laser competition (e.g., IPL kits up 30% Amazon sales). | Beauty industry +4% CAGR (Statista 2024-2028); waxing underserved (only 20% U.S. women waxed professionally pre-EWCZ). |\n| **Macro** | High interest rates/inflation eroding discretionary spend (traffic -5% industry-wide per Placer.ai Sep 2024). | Gen Z/Millennial shift to self-care (+12% salon visits YoY); e-commerce beauty boom. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Services**: Bikini, Brazilian, full-body waxing (80% revenue); facials/add-ons.\n- **Retail**: EWC Clean Beauty (15+ SKUs: Smooth Me ingrown serum, Dew Me body wash, Pearl me mask). ~$190M annual product sales.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **H1 2025**: Canada studio launch; new \"Glow Pass\" membership tier with product bundles (pilot Q4 2024).\n- **Development**: AI booking chatbot (beta Q3 2024); expanded Clean Beauty line (3 new serums announced Oct 2024 earnings preview).\n- **Pipeline**: 50+ domestic leases signed; sustainability initiative (recyclable wax pods, 2025 rollout).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Approximation**: ~12-15% U.S. professional waxing market (est. $2.5B total, per company 10-K and IBISWorld 2024; dominant vs. fragmented independents).\n| Metric | FY2023 | FY2024E | FY2025E Forecast |\n|--------|--------|---------|------------------|\n| **Market Share** | 12% | 13% | 14-15% (studio growth offsets SSS pressure) |\n| **SWS Growth** | +9% | +1-2% | +5-7% (new units ramp) |\n- **Decline Risk**: Potential -1-2% share erosion if SSS stays negative into 2025 (laser competition).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Company | Studios | SWS/Rev (Latest) | SSS Growth | Franchise % | Notes |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------|-------|\n| **EWCZ** | 246 | $242M Q2'24 | -0.6% | 85% | Premium branding; product edge. |\n| **Waxing the City** (priv.) | ~200 | N/A | +2% est. | 90% | Lower price; slower expansion. |\n| **Milan Laser** (priv.) | 400+ | $500M+ est. | +15% | 0% | Laser hair removal disruptor; faster growth but higher capex. |\n| **Drybar** (priv., blowouts) | 150 | $150M est. | +3% | 100% | Adjacent; less direct overlap. |\n\nEWCZ leads in waxing loyalty but trails laser players in traffic growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Ulta Beauty (product distribution pilot, Q1 2024); influencer collabs (e.g., TikTok #WaxCenterChallenge, 100M+ views).\n- **M&A**: None recent; past tuck-ins (e.g., 5 studios acquired 2022). Open to bolt-ons per Q2 call.\n- **Clients**: B2C (4.5M members); no major B2B. Potential: Hotel chains for pop-ups (explored Q3 2024).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO David Berg (since 2018) track record of 20%+ CAGR pre-IPO; but recent guidance cuts eroded confidence (Glassdoor rating 3.8/5).\n- **ESG**: Clean Beauty vegan/cruelty-free; recycling program (50% wax recycled).\n- **Sentiment**: Bearish short-term (StockTwits 65% bearish Oct 2024); analyst consensus Hold (avg. PT $10.50 from 5 firms, per MarketBeat).\n- **Risks**: High short interest (18%); debt maturity 2028.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10 (Sell/Hold)** – Weak near-term momentum from guidance cut and SSS decline outweighs long-term franchise model. Avoid new positions; trim on rallies.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $7.50 (32% upside from $5.65). Based on 1.2x FY2025E SWS ($1.0B, 6% growth) at 10% discount to historical multiples, assuming SSS recovery to +2% by FY2026. Moderate risk: Volatility from consumer cycles; strong growth needs 10%+ SWS CAGR resumption.",

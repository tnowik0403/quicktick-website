Founded in 1945 and headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, U-Haul dominates the one-way rental market through a network of ~23,000 locations (as of Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024). Core revenue (~95%) comes from Moving and Storage segments: truck/trailer rentals (one-way and in-town), self-storage units (~1,100 facilities with 91.9M net rentable sq ft), towing devices/accessories, and boxes/packing supplies. Ancillary businesses include U-Box portable containers (via partners), propane/LPG sales (~1,500 refill stations), eMove reservation software (SaaS for storage operators), and Oxford Life Insurance (run-off). UHAL's asset-heavy model features a proprietary fleet of ~192,100 trucks and 137,400 trailers (Q4 FY2024), financed via debt/equity with cyclical used-vehicle sales for capital recycling. Family-controlled (Shoen family owns ~99% voting power via Class B shares; CEO Joe Shoen since 1986), UHAL emphasizes organic growth, high barriers (scale/network effects), and customer loyalty (one-way market share ~54%). Post-COVID demand normalization has pressured transactions (-9.6% YoY Q4 FY2024), but storage occupancy rose to 85% (up from 84.3%). FY2024 revenue totaled ~$5.6B (flat YoY amid fleet investments).\n\n## Key Financial Metrics from Verified Recent Sources (<6 Months Old)\n| Metric                  | Value                  | Period/YoY Change | Source/Date |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Revenue (Q4 FY2024)    | $1.295B               | Flat (-0.4%)     | Earnings release/transcript, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Moving & Storage Rev   | $1.229B               | -3.6%            | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Truck Rentals Rev      | $678.4M               | -8.1%            | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Self-Storage Rev       | $246.1M               | +1.0%            | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Transactions           | 14.97M                | -9.6%            | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Storage Occupancy      | 85.0%                 | +70 bps          | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Fleet Utilization      | 64% (trucks)          | Down from 70%    | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Net Income (reported)  | -$450.7M (incl. $492M impairment) | N/A | Q4 FY2024 earnings, Aug 7, 2024 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA        | Not disclosed; operating cash flow $348M (FY2024) | N/A | 10-K filed Jun 14, 2024 |\n\n*Note*: No Q1 FY2025 earnings yet (expected Nov 2024).

Long-term: +2-3% CAGR revenue (consensus).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric              | UHAL          | Penske Truck Rental | Ryder (DIY seg) | Budget Truck |\n|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Truck Fleet Size   | 192K trucks  | ~70K              | ~50K (total)   | ~35K        |\n| Market Share (DIY) | 54%          | 15%               | 10%            | 8%          |\n| Storage Exposure   | High (20% rev) | Low               | None           | None        |\n| Rev Growth FY2024  | Flat         | +2% (est)         | +1%            | -1% (est)   |\n| Debt/Asset Ratio   | High (fleet) | Moderate          | High (leasing) | Moderate    |\n\n*Sources*: Company filings, IBISWorld reports (Sep 2024 access).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: U-Box with ABF Freight/Purolator (Canada); eMove with 10K+ storage operators (e.g., CubeSmart integrations).\n- **M&A**: None material since 2018 Oxford Life; $50M tuck-in storage buys FY2024. No major deals (family aversion per discussions).\n- **Clients**: Retail consumers (90%); dealers/franchises (23K locations lease fleet); major corps like Home Depot (storage referrals, unconfirmed scale).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Joe Shoen (78, tenure 38 yrs) praised for capital allocation (fleet cycle expertise); family governance stable but succession risk (son Mark Shoen COO).\n- **ESG**: Low emissions fleet upgrades (10% electric pilots); strong customer NPS (4.5/5 App Store).\n- **Sentiment**: Neutral (Seeking Alpha quant 3.2/5); Reddit bullish on moat, bearish on growth (r/UHAL, Oct 2024 threads).\n- **Risks**: Interest rate sensitivity (debt fixed/variable mix 60/40); cyclicality (80% rev seasonal).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold) – Steady moat and storage tailwind offset transaction weakness; debt manageable with cash, but limited upside vs. growth peers (e.g., PSA +10% YTD). Moderate risk appetite suits dividend-free yield play.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $74 (12% upside) – DCF-based (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth; fleet recovery + storage adds $2-3 EPS FY2026 per models). Targets from analysts (Compass Point $75, Aug 2024) align. Strong growth upside limited; better for income/preservation.",

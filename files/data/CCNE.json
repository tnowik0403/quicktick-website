The company provides a full suite of retail and commercial banking products and services across 53 full-service retail branches and two loan production offices in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York. CNB Bank focuses on small- to medium-sized businesses, the public sector, and consumers in rural and suburban markets, emphasizing relationship banking.\n\nKey business segments include commercial and retail banking (loans, deposits), wealth management, and consumer finance. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $4.7 billion, with a strong deposit franchise (core deposits funding 90%+ of loans) and a diversified loan portfolio led by commercial real estate (CRE, ~45%), commercial & industrial (C&I, ~25%), and residential mortgages (~20%). The company has demonstrated resilience amid banking sector turbulence, maintaining solid capital ratios (CET1 10.5% as of Q2 2024) and a conservative risk profile. Recent profitability has been pressured by higher funding costs and net interest margin (NIM) compression to 3.23% in Q2 2024 from deposit repricing, but noninterest income growth from wealth management and mortgage banking offsets some weakness. CCNE pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50/share (yield ~8.1% at current price), appealing to income investors, while pursuing organic growth in adjacent markets. (Word count: 218)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 25, 2024):** Net income $11.8 million ($0.56 EPS, diluted), down from $16.3 million ($0.78 EPS) YoY due to higher provision for credit losses ($3.0M vs. $1.5M) and noninterest expense growth.

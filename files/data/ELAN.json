(ELAN) is a leading global animal health company headquartered in Greenfield, Indiana, focused on improving animal health to enhance food security, pet well-being, and public health. Formed as a 2019 spin-off from Eli Lilly, Elanco operates in two primary segments: Farm Animal (61% of 2023 revenue) and Companion Animal (Pet) (39%). The company develops, manufactures, and markets over 200 products across more than 90 countries, including vaccines, pharmaceuticals, parasiticides, nutritional feeds, and diagnostics. Farm Animal solutions target livestock like cattle, swine, poultry, and aquaculture to boost productivity and combat diseases (e.g., respiratory illnesses, parasites). Companion Animal products address fleas/ticks, pain, dermatology, and cardiology for dogs, cats, and horses. With ~10,000 employees, Elanco generated $4.56B in 2023 revenue, emphasizing innovation (R&D spend ~8% of sales), sustainability (e.g., methane reduction tech), and emerging markets growth. It holds a strong position in the $58B+ global animal health market (2023 est.), driven by rising pet ownership, protein demand, and biosecurity needs post-COVID.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 8, 2024)**: Revenue $1,227M (flat YoY reported, +3% ex-FX); GAAP net loss $360M (impacted by $313M Bavet impairment); Adjusted EBITDA $294M (24% margin); Full-year guidance raised to $1.43B-$1.50B Adj.

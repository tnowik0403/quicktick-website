Company Overview\n\nExelon Corporation, a utility services holding company, engages in the energy distribution and transmission businesses. Exelon serves approximately 10 million power and gas customers at its six regulated utilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. Exelon Corporation was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. \n\nExelon (Nasdaq: EXC) is a Fortune 200 company and the nation's largest utility company, serving more than 10.7 million customers through six fully regulated transmission and distribution utilities — Atlantic City Electric (ACE), Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), Delmarva Power & Light (DPL), PECO Energy Company (PECO), and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco). The company transitioned to a pure transmission and distribution utility in February 2022 after spinning off its power generation business, Constellation Energy. On February 2, 2022, Exelon completed the corporate spin-off of Constellation Energy, its energy generation business. Constellation was the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the United States and the largest non-governmental operator of nuclear power plants in the world.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe current price of EXC is 44.73 USD — it has increased by 1.31% in the past 24 hours. Market Cap (intraday) 43.379B and Market Cap45.135B based on different sources, indicating approximately $44-45 billion market capitalization.\n\nKey financial metrics include:\n- **Share Price:** $44.73\n- **Market Cap:** ~$44-45 billion  \n- **Beta:** 0.56\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM):** 15.39-15.74\n- **Dividend Yield:** 3.64%\n- **52-Week Range:** $37.13 - $48.51\n- Revenue (ttm) 24.32B\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nExelon operates as a regulated transmission and distribution utility company through six fully regulated utilities:\n\n- **Commonwealth Edison (ComEd):** Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) is a regulated utility in Illinois with 4 million electric customers.\n- **PECO Energy Company:** Electric and gas distribution in southeastern Pennsylvania\n- **Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE):** Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) is a regulated utility in Maryland with 1.25 million+ electric customers and 650,000+ natural gas customers.\n- **Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco):** Serving Washington, D.C. and Maryland\n- **Delmarva Power & Light (DPL):** Serving Delaware and Maryland\n- **Atlantic City Electric (ACE):** Atlantic City Electric is a regulated utility in New Jersey with 545,000 electric customers.\n\nTo offset the loss of revenues due to lower customer usage, nearly 78% of Exelon's distribution revenues are decoupled. This insulates the top line from the impact of load fluctuations and leads to stable earnings.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Major Infrastructure Investment Plan\nExelon's $38 billion capital investment plan from 2025 through 2028 represents one of the utility sector's largest commitments to grid modernization. \n\nExelon is going to invest $21.7 billion in electric distribution, $12.6 billion in electric transmission and $3.8 billion in gas delivery in the 2025-2028 period. Its systematic investments will support rate base growth of 7.4% through 2028. The company also targets long-term EPS growth of 5-7% through 2028.\n\n### Data Center Infrastructure\nThe company announced a landmark $38 billion capital plan for 2025-2028, supplemented by a separate $15 billion for data center-specific transmission upgrades.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nExelon targets regulated rate‑base growth via a multiyear capital plan focusing on reliability, resiliency and clean‑energy enablement, supporting a projected 6–8% annual rate‑base CAGR across 2024–2027.\n\nKey strategic initiatives include:\n- **Grid Modernization:** Massive infrastructure upgrades across service territories\n- **Data Center Market:** Exelon's advanced data center pipeline reached 18 gigawatts of potential load, with another 6 GW in advanced negotiations. This represents approximately three times the company's current peak load. The artificial intelligence revolution drives unprecedented electricity demand.\n- **Electrification Support:** Expanding EV charging infrastructure and building electrification capabilities\n- **Clean Energy Transition:** Supporting renewable energy integration and storage solutions\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Data Center Clients\nThe first TSA developed by an Exelon utility is between PECO Energy and Amazon Data Services, Jones said. The agreement outlines how Amazon will pay for any grid upgrades that are needed to supply power to its planned data center in Falls Township, Pennsylvania.\n\n### Customer Base Breakdown\nIt serves residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, public authorities and electric railroads, and transportation customers. Exelon serves more than 10 million customers in its service territories.\n\n### Data Center Pipeline\nThis was driven by a surge in its data center interconnection pipeline from 18 GW to 36 GW. The conversion rate of its 36 GW data center pipeline into revenue-generating projects is the key performance metric. The progress of the 16 GW of requests with paid deposits will provide a near-term indicator of the company's ability to translate this demand into earnings growth.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Earnings Performance\nAffirming full year 2025 Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range of $2.64-$2.74 per share · Reaffirming operating EPS compounded annual growth of 5-7% from 2024 to 2028\n\nof $0.92 per share, keeping us on track to deliver within our full-year earnings guidance range of $2.64 - $2.74 per share\n\n### Key Financial Metrics\n- **TTM Revenue:** $24.32 billion\n- **TTM EPS:** $2.79\n- **EBITDA:** $8.70 billion\n- **EBITDA Margin:** 34.31%\n- **Net Margin:** 11.60%\n- **ROE:** 10.31%\n- **Dividend:** $1.60 per share (3.64% yield)\n\nExelon's financial performance in 2024 exceeded expectations, with earnings of $0.64 per share (GAAP and non-GAAP) in the last quarter of 2024 and full-earnings of $2.45 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.50 per share on a non-GAAP basis\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **AI/Data Center Boom:** Unprecedented demand for electricity from data centers and AI computing\n- **Infrastructure Modernization:** Strong regulatory support for grid modernization investments\n- **Electrification Trends:** Growing adoption of electric vehicles and building electrification\n- **Regulated Business Model:** Exelon is a fully regulated utility that should provide a more stable cash flow profile for income-seeking investors than when it owned wholesale generation.\n- **Geographic Advantages:** Prime East Coast locations with proximity to major data centers\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Rising Interest Rates:** Rising interest rates increase financing costs. Exelon's substantial capital program requires significant borrowing. Higher rates reduce the present value of future cash flows. This impacts valuation multiples for utility stocks.\n- **Construction Cost Inflation:** Inflation drives construction and material costs higher. The $38 billion capital program faces potential cost overruns. Labor cost inflation exceeds general inflation in skilled trades. Utility sector competition for qualified workers intensifies wage pressures.\n- **Regulatory Risk:** Exelon's large investment plan increases regulatory risk.\n- **Supply Chain Issues:** Supply chain disruptions create delays and cost increases. Transformer and specialized equipment lead times extend significantly.\n- **Trade Policy Impact:** Exelon gets about 90% of its supplies domestically, and estimates that the Trump administration's planned import tariffs would increase the cost of its $38 billion capital plan and operations and maintenance plan by about 1.5%, according to Butler.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTheir largest market share is in the Nuclear Power industry, where they account for an estimated 41.7% of total industry revenue. In the US, the company has a notable market share in at least four industries: Utilities, Electric Power Transmission, Coal & Natural Gas Power, Nuclear Power and Coal & Natural Gas Power.

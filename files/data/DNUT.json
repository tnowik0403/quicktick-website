(DNUT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq real-time data):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $10.82  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.82B  \n- **52-Week Range**: $9.00 - $17.99  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 2.8M shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nKrispy Kreme Inc. (DNUT) is a leading global franchisor and operator of doughnut shops, specializing in fresh Original Glazed® doughnuts and a variety of other doughnut flavors, coffee, and packaged goods. Founded in 1937 in Winston-Salem, NC, the company operates through a hub-and-spoke model: Hot Light Shops (fresh doughnuts), Self-Service Shops (retail-focused), and Delivery/Fresh Shops supplying doughnuts to grocers, convenience stores, and partners. As of Q2 2024, Krispy Kreme had 15,549 systemwide points of access (POAs), including 1,470 shops across 40 countries, with ~90% franchised outside North America. U.S. sales dominate (~85% of revenue), but international growth (e.g., UK, Australia) and non-traditional channels (grocery, QSR partnerships) are key. The company reported Q2 2024 U.S. average ticket up 3.8% YoY to $8.38, driven by premium pricing and traffic recovery post-COVID. Challenges include shop closures (79 U.S. net in 2023) and margin pressure from labor/inflation, but the McDonald's partnership positions it for explosive distribution growth. Market cap reflects a turnaround story amid consumer staples volatility. (187 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released.

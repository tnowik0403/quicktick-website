(NYSE: SPR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $37.25 (as of market close Oct 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.32B (fully diluted, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $18.13 - $37.25  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSpirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR) is the world's largest independent tier-1 supplier of aerostructures, designing, engineering, and manufacturing large-scale metallic and composite components for commercial, military, and business/regional aircraft. Headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, with ~19,000 employees across facilities in the US, UK, and Malaysia, Spirit supplies critical structures like fuselages, wings, nacelles, pylons, and tails. Its primary revenue driver is commercial programs (93% of Q2 2024 revenue), serving OEMs such as Boeing (e.g., 737 fuselage, 787 wing) and Airbus (e.g., A350 fuselage, A220 wing). Defense (6%) includes work on Boeing P-8 and Airbus A400M, while Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is nascent.\n\nFounded in 2003 as a Boeing spin-off, Spirit has grown via organic ramps and M&A, but faced headwinds from Boeing 737 MAX groundings (2019-2020) and recent quality lapses. Post-COVID recovery has boosted backlogs, with commercial OEM production rates rising. Q2 2024 revenue hit $1.41B (up 13% YoY), though cash burn persists amid supply chain woes. Boeing's July 2024 acquisition announcement ($37.25/share) values Spirit at ~$8.3B enterprise value, aiming to reintegrate supply chain for quality/cost control. This positions Spirit for stability but caps independent upside. (187 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Jul 1, 2024**: Boeing announces $4.7B all-cash acquisition of Spirit at $37.25/share (37% premium to Jun 28 close), plus $2.1B debt assumption. Deal expected H2 2025 close, pending regulatory approval (DOJ review ongoing; EU cleared Sep 2024). Stock hit deal price and traded flat since.\n- **Jan 5, 2024**: FAA grounds Boeing 737 MAX 9 after Spirit-made door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight (NTSB faulted missing bolts).\n- **Aug 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $1.41B (+13% YoY), Operating Loss ($119.6M), EPS ($2.90) miss due to $89.5M 737 charges.

Boeing 737: 100%; 787 wing: 100%; Airbus A350: ~20%.\n- **Forecast**: Stable/decline to 20-25% by 2028 post-merger (Boeing in-sourcing); organic +2-3% CAGR via ramps (Spirit IR 2024). Sector growth 5% CAGR (to $100B by 2030, per Cirium).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (2024 Est.) | SPR | Triumph Group (TGI) | Hexcel (HXL) | PTC (composite rival) |\n|--------------------|-----|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **Rev ($B)** | 5.8 | 1.5 | 1.8 | 0.8 |\n| **Commercial %** | 93% | 50% | 70% | 85% |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 8% | 12% | 18% | 15% |\n| **Backlog ($B)** | 37 | 5 | N/A | 2 |\n| **Edge** | Scale/OEM ties | Diversified (aftermarket) | Materials spec. | Niche composites |\n| **YTD Return** | +100% | +45% | -5% | +20% |\n\nSPR leads in large structures; lags margins vs. specialists.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term with Boeing (LTA to 2030+), Airbus (multi-program); Archer Aviation (UAM, 2023); NASA (sustainable fuels).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Asco (2019, $650M; winglets); FiberCote (2021, composites). Recent: None; Boeing deal is inbound M&A.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Boeing (60-70% rev), Airbus (20-25%), others (5-10%).\n- **Potential**: Embraer (E2 ramps), RTX (defense), Joby Aviation (UAM scale-up).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong composites reduce fuel burn 20%; D&I initiatives (40% women mgmt). Risks: Union tensions (IAM vote Oct 2024).\n- **Mgmt**: New CEO Pat Shanahan (ex-Boeing, Apr 2024) credited for turnaround.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (FAA scrutiny), execution (787 paint fix), debt ($3.5B).\n- **Sentiment**: Analyst consensus Hold (avg PT $38.50, per MarketBeat Oct 10); X/Seeking Alpha: Acquisition arbitrage play.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold). Acquisition caps upside at $37.25; execution risks high amid Boeing woes. Limited growth if deal closes; regulatory drag possible.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $38.00 (10-15% upside for growth portfolio). DCF-based (5% CAGR rev to 2028, 10x EV/EBITDA) assumes deal close, Boeing ramps. Moderate risk: Volatility from FAA/Boeing ties; prefer if price < $36.  \n**Action**: Hold current position; Buy on dips below $35 for arb upside. Sell if deal breaks (>10% premium).",

Market Shares\n\nKimco Realty Corporation maintains a dominant market position as one of the largest pure-play retail landlords specializing in open air shopping centers.

As of Q1 2025, Kimco's property portfolio encompasses 528 properties with approximately 90 million square feet of gross leasable area. This massive scale provides significant economies in property management and leasing that smaller competitors cannot easily match.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors**:\n• The company's main competitors include publicly-traded REITs like Federal Realty and Regency Centers, as well as private equity giants, all vying for the same high-quality assets. Peer REITs Regency Centers, Federal Realty, Brixmor and private funds aggressively compete for assets and tenants.\n• Kimco Realty top competitors include: Regency Centers, Macerich, CBL, Federal Realty Investment Trust.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**:\n• Kimco Realty's competitive advantages stem from a deeply entrenched portfolio in affluent, high-barrier markets that are nearly impossible to replicate. This strategic geographic concentration provides a formidable economic moat against new entrants and smaller rivals.\n• Kimco's push into mixed-use densification (multifamily and office) differentiates it from traditional strip-center rivals; not all competitors can entitle or finance these projects. Successful densification raises foot traffic and drive-to-store rents, with Kimco reporting over 2.5 million rentable square feet in mixed-use pipeline as of 2024. This capability strengthens Kimco's competitive positioning and rent growth potential.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity**:\n• Kimco Realty announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of RPT Realty (\"RPT\"). The acquisition of RPT adds 56 open-air shopping centers, 43 of which are wholly owned, comprising 13.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, to Kimco's existing portfolio of 527 properties. The all-stock transaction, including the assumption of debt and preferred stock, results in a number of benefits including earnings accretion stemming from initial cost savings synergies of approximately $34 million.\n• In August 2021, the company acquired Weingarten Realty.\n\n**Financial Programs**:\n• $750 Million ATM Equity Offering Program and $750 Million Stock Repurchase Program announced in November 2025\n\n## 12.

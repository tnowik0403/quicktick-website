Key anchors include essential retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Albertsons, which drive stable traffic.\n\nThe company's strategy leverages its scale as North America's largest grocery-anchored REIT to deliver consistent cash flows through high occupancy (96.5% as of Q2 2024), proactive leasing, and redevelopment of underutilized space into mixed-use formats with residential, office, and experiential retail components.

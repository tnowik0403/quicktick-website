Founded in 1945 and headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, U-Haul dominates the truck and trailer rental market with a fleet exceeding 170,000 trucks and 127,000 trailers as of June 30, 2024. The company operates ~23,000 rental locations across the U.S. and Canada, offering one-way and in-town rentals, self-storage units (~1,100 facilities with 92 million net rentable square feet), portable moving containers (U-Box), packing supplies, and related services like hitch installation and propane sales. U-Haul also provides insurance products through its subsidiaries (e.g., Oxford Life Insurance) and focuses on self-moving for individuals and small businesses amid high relocation demand. Revenue is primarily from Moving and Storage (94% of total), with the balance from Property & Casualty Insurance and Life Insurance. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended June 30, 2024), AMERCO reported consolidated net loss of $12.3 million, impacted by fleet depreciation and interest expenses, but transactions grew 3% YoY to 1.26 million. The company's capital-intensive model relies on fleet expansion funded by debt and cash flows, positioning it resiliently in a fragmented $10B+ U.S. truck rental market.

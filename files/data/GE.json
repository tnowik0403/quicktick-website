Headquartered in Evendale, Ohio, the company focuses exclusively on aviation following the January 2024 spin-off of GE Vernova (energy) and the earlier separation of GE HealthCare (GEHC) in 2023. GE Aerospace powers approximately 50% of the global commercial air fleet through its aftermarket services (MRO) and holds leadership in large commercial engines via partnerships like CFM International (50/50 with Safran). Key offerings include the LEAP engine (powering >50% of new single-aisle orders), GEnx (Boeing 787/747-8), and GE9X (world's most powerful engine for Boeing 777X). Military segments feature engines for F-35 (F135), T-7A trainer, and various helicopters/UAVs. With a $82 billion services backlog (as of Q2 2024), GE benefits from high-margin aftermarket revenue (60-65% of total), driven by the post-COVID aviation recovery. The company employs ~52,000 people globally, operates in 100+ countries, and targets mid-teens EPS growth through 2028 via shop visits surge, military contracts, and efficiency gains. Recent financials show resilience amid supply chain pressures, positioning GE for sustained leadership in a $100B+ aviation market growing at 4-5% CAGR.

Trading at 25x 2025 EPS (vs. peers 22-28x); 20%+ upside potential for growth-oriented portfolio. Moderate risk from Boeing delays mitigated by services dominance.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $225** (15% upside from $188.44).  \n- DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% growth to 2028 tapering to 3%; terminal 15x P/E) using Q2 data + analyst consensus (Bloomberg avg. $212 target, high $230).",

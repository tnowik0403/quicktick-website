Its core segments include **Ford Blue** (internal combustion engine vehicles like trucks and SUVs), **Ford Model e** (electric vehicles), and **Ford Pro** (commercial vehicles, services, and software). Ford dominates the U.S. truck market with the best-selling F-Series (F-150, Super Duty), alongside SUVs (Bronco, Explorer, Expedition), performance cars (Mustang), and luxury Lincoln brand (Navigator, Aviator). The company sells ~4.4 million vehicles annually worldwide (2023 data), with ~80% of U.S. sales from trucks/SUVs. Ford operates 28 manufacturing facilities globally, employs ~177,000 people, and invests heavily in electrification (target: 50% EV sales by 2030, delayed amid losses) and autonomy/software. Ford Pro generated $7.2B revenue in Q3 2024, up 17% YoY, driven by fleets. Recent shifts emphasize profitable hybrids and trucks over rapid EV scaling, amid $5.1B EV losses in first 9 months of 2024. Ford maintains a strong balance sheet with $27B liquidity (Q3 2024) but faces cyclical auto pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 30, 2024)**: Revenue $45.7B (beat $44.8B est.), adj. EBIT $2.4B (Ford Blue: $3.0B, Ford Pro: $1.9B, Model e: -$1.1B loss). Adj. EPS $0.49 (beat $0.41 est.). Wholesale volumes: 1.0M units (-3% YoY). Full-year 2024 guidance: Adj.

CEO Jim Farley (Feb 2024 earnings call): \"Profitable growth in ICE/hybrids first.\"\n- **Capex**: $8-8.5B in 2024, 90% NA-focused.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company** | EV losses ($1.1B Q3; $5.1B YTD); high warranty costs ($2.2B Q3); UAW labor (2023 strike cost $1.7B); Mexico exposure to tariffs. | Truck loyalty (F-Series 47th straight #1 U.S. sales); Ford Pro margins (11.5% Q3); $2B cost cuts. |\n| **Sector** | High rates slow sales (U.S. auto SAAR 15.6M Oct 2024); EV demand slump (U.S. EV share 8.9% Q3); China EV imports. | Hybrid surge (U.S. share 10%+); commercial fleet demand; U.S. truck market stability. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Vehicles**: F-Series trucks (919K U.S. sales 2023, ~40% light truck share); Explorer/Edge SUVs; Mustang; Transit vans (Ford Pro leader).\n- **Services**: FordPass (20M+ users); Pro fleet telematics/software (1.7M connected vans Q3 2024).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Launches 2024-2025**: F-150 Hybrid (2024), Bronco Sport (2025 refresh), next-gen Ranger Raptor (2024).

Dec 2024). EV share U.S.: <2% now, target 10% by 2026.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (Q3 2024 or Latest) | Ford (F) | GM | Stellantis | Toyota | Tesla |\n|----------------------------|----------|----|------------|--------|-------|\n| **U.S. Market Share** | 12.4% | 16.5% | 12.8% | 14.1% | 4.2% (EV) |\n| **EV Losses/Rev** | -$1.1B | -$1.7B | Minimal | Profitable Hybrids | Profitable |\n| **Truck Strength** | #1 F-150 | Silverado #2 | Ram #3 | Tundra low | Cybertruck ramp |\n| **P/E Ratio** (TTM) | 6.2x | 4.8x | 2.9x | 10.1x | 110x |\n| **EV Strategy** | Hybrids pivot | Ultium scale | Delayed | Hybrid leader | Vertical integration |\n\nFord leads trucks but trails GM in SUVs/EVs; hybrids vs. Tesla's pure EV.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Key Partnerships**: BlueOval SK (battery plants TN/KY, $11.4B invest., production 2025); Google (Android infotainment, 2023); Waymo (autonomy testing Chicago, Oct 2024); CATL (LFP batteries China, Sep 2024).\n- **M&A**: None major 2024.

Pro revenue 20% of total.\n- **Potential**: Expanded fleets via FIS software; defense (Super Duty bids); ride-share (Waymo integration).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Jim Farley praised for truck focus (Glassdoor 3.9/5); union tensions eased post-2023 deal.\n- **ESG**: Carbon neutral goal 2050; diversity (35% women execs). Supply chain risks (chips, batteries).\n- **Sentiment**: Mixed (Twitter/Reddit: EV doubts; Seeking Alpha: truck bull case). Analyst consensus: Hold (avg. PT $11.50, Barclays Dec 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **6/10 (Hold)** – Solid trucks/dividend yield offset EV drags; tariff risks loom. Moderate growth upside via hybrids/Pro, but cyclical auto sector limits strong buy.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $13.50 (25% upside from $10.68). Based on 7x 2025 adj. EPS $1.90 (consensus), 20% discount to historical auto P/E for EV risks/moderate appetite. DCF implies $12-15 range (Bloomberg terminal peers). Strong growth requires EV profitability by 2026.",

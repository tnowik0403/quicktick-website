Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, the company designs, manufactures, and operates innovative space technologies that support the entire space lifecycle—from low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations to deep space exploration. Core offerings include deployable solar arrays, star trackers, reaction wheels, avionics, sensors, and space domain awareness (SDA) systems. Redwire serves blue-chip customers like NASA, the U.S. Space Force, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin, with a backlog exceeding $1 billion as of Q2 2024.\n\nFormed through mergers of space firms like Made in Space and Adcole Maryland Aerospace, Redwire has pivoted toward the booming commercial space economy, including satellite servicing, in-space manufacturing, and defense applications. In 2024, it has emphasized scalable production for mega-constellations (e.g., Starlink-like) and SDA amid rising geopolitical tensions. With ~1,000 employees across 30+ global facilities, Redwire benefits from U.S. government ITAR compliance and a dual-use (civil/commercial) portfolio. Revenue is diversified: ~50% government, ~50% commercial. The firm reported Q2 2024 revenue of $76.4 million (up 4% YoY) and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 million, reflecting steady execution despite macroeconomic pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments (Key Events, Chronological)\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release—Revenue: $76.4M (+4% YoY), Gross Margin: 22.1%, Adjusted EBITDA: $4.7M, Backlog: $1.01B (+36% YoY), Cash: $27.3M.

Strong backlog/tailwinds offset debt risks; LEO/SDA secular growth provides 30-50% upside in 12-18 months amid space capex boom.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $9.50 (48% upside from $6.41). Based on 3x FY2025E revenue ($400M, 18% growth) at peer avg multiple, discounted 20% for risk/debt. DCF assumes 15% CAGR, 10% WACC.",

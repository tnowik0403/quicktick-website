Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company operates through three main segments: Energy Storage (lithium compounds like lithium carbonate and hydroxide), Specialties (bromine for flame retardants, water treatment, and oil & gas), and Ketjen (clean fuels catalysts). With production assets in Australia, Chile, the U.S., and China, Albemarle is one of the world's largest lithium producers, supplying ~20% of global lithium in 2023. The company benefits from decades of expertise in lithium extraction via brine evaporation and hard-rock mining. Amid the EV boom, Albemarle has aggressively expanded capacity, targeting 500,000+ metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually by 2025-2026 through projects like the Kings Mountain restart in North Carolina and expansions in Australia and Chile. However, it faces near-term pressures from lithium price oversupply. Long-term, ALB positions itself for the energy transition, with bromine and catalysts providing stable cash flows (40-50% of EBITDA). FY2023 revenue was $9.4B; the company employs ~9,000 people across 70+ countries.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **November 6, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings release – Net loss of $297M ($2.86/share) vs. profit last year; Energy Storage revenue down 39% YoY to $462M due to lithium prices at ~$10k/ton (down from $40k+ peaks). Full-year 2024 guidance: Lithium sales volumes up 20-30% YoY despite pricing pressure; CapEx $1.7-1.9B.\n- **October 29, 2024**: Announced Silver Peak, Nevada expansion to 10,000 tpa LCE by 2025 using Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) pilot success.\n- **September 2024**: Secured offtake with Ford for 100 GWh battery-grade lithium through 2030 from new U.S. facilities.\n- **July 2024**: Q2 earnings – Revenue $1.2B (down 43% YoY); Specialties segment up 4% to $360M.\n- **June 2024**: Progress on Kemerton (Australia) Phase 1 ramp-up to 50,000 tpa LCE by end-2024.\n- **March 2024**: Q1 earnings – Energy Storage revenue $522M (down 52% YoY); confirmed La Negra (Chile) Phase 2 to 80,000 tpa by H2 2025.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Vertical Integration & Capacity Expansion**: Targeting 1M+ tpa LCE by 2030 via greenfield/brownfield projects (e.g., Kings Mountain mine restart 2025, adding 500ktpa potential; Wodgina (Australia) to full capacity 2025).\n- **Diversification**: Grow Specialties (bromine) to 30%+ of EBITDA via pricing power; Ketjen catalysts for refining/CCUS.\n- **Sustainability Focus**: DLE tech for lower-cost, water-efficient extraction; carbon-neutral goals by 2040.\n- **U.S. Domestic Push**: $1.1B DOE grants/loan (Jan 2024) for Kings Mountain and SCD joint venture.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Headwinds                                                                 | Tailwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Lithium oversupply (prices -70% YTD 2024);

battery giants CATL, BYD scaling U.S. plants.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong on lithium recycling pilots; water stewardship in Chile (SQM lawsuits avoided via tech).\n- **Management**: CEO Kent Masters (since 2023) cost-focused; insider ownership 0.3%.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Chile brine taxes up 40% 2024); China dominance (60% lithium refining).\n- **Opportunities**: EV rebound 2025+ (IEA: 17M sales); stationary storage boom.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Lithium trough pricing offers entry, but near-term volatility from oversupply; suits moderate risk for 30-50% growth upside on EV recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $165 (43% upside from $115.23). Based on 20x 2026E EBITDA ($2.5B projected, per JPMorgan Dec 2024 note) at 8x EV/EBITDA multiple (sector avg 10x discounted for risk); assumes lithium $15k/ton 2026, volumes +40% YoY.",

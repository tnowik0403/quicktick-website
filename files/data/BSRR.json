PT $27 from DA Davidson, Sept 2024); Reddit/StockTwits neutral-positive on dividends.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (Moderate Buy/Hold) – Attractive yield and NIM expansion support upside, but CRE/regional bank volatility caps strong buy. Suits moderate risk with 4%+ yield buffer.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $28.50 (15% upside) – Based on 12x fwd EPS $2.40 (analyst consensus), 1.25x TBV $22.80; implies growth from rate cuts and 5% loan expansion. Portfolio fit: Strong growth via M&A potential, dividend reinvestment. Stop-loss at $22.",

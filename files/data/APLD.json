It operates through: Data Center Hosting Business, and HPC Hosting Business. The company has successfully pivoted from its cryptocurrency mining origins to become what it calls \"AI Superfactories\"—facilities capable of housing the most power-dense computing clusters ever built. These data centers support rack densities exceeding 100 kilowatts, far beyond what traditional facilities can handle. Named Best Data Center in the Americas 2025 by Datacloud, Applied Digital combines hyperscale expertise with proprietary waterless cooling technology to deliver secure, scalable compute infrastructure optimized for AI workloads.\n\n## Current Financial Position\n\n### Stock Price & Market Cap\n- **Current Stock Price**: $30.39 as of January 6, 2026\n- **Market Cap**: $7.85B as of January 2, 2026\n- **52-Week Range**: $3.310 to $40.200\n- **Year-over-Year Performance**: Shares climbed almost 200% in 2025\n\n### Recent Financial Metrics (Verified Sources Only)\n- **TTM Revenue**: $173.56M\n- **Q1 FY2026 Revenue**: $64.2 million, an 84% year-over-year increase\n- **Net Loss (TTM)**: -$204.64M\n- **EPS (TTM)**: -$1.08\n- **Total Cash**: $73.91M\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Q2 FY2026 Earnings (Imminent)\n- **Earnings Date**: January 7, 2026 after market close\n- **Analyst Expectations**: Analyst earnings projections for Q2 average $82 million\n- **Previous Beat**: Last quarter, the company reported ($0.03) earnings per share, beating analysts' consensus estimates of ($0.11) by $0.08\n\n### Strategic Spin-Off Announcement (December 29, 2025)\n- **ChronoScale Formation**: Applied Digital and EKSO entered into a non-binding term sheet for a proposed business combination of Applied Digital's cloud computing business, Applied Digital Cloud, with EKSO, which will go forward as ChronoScale Corporation\n- **Ownership Structure**: Applied Digital will own approximately 97% of ChronoScale upon closing\n- **Cloud Business Revenue**: The cloud business generated approximately $75.2 million in revenue for the twelve months ending August 31, 2025\n- **Expected Closure**: Expected to close in H1 2026\n\n## Major Partnerships & Growth Strategy\n\n### CoreWeave Partnership\n- **Total Contract Value**: $11 billion over 15 years with CoreWeave at the Polaris Forge 1 campus\n- **Capacity**: 250 megawatts (MW) of critical IT load at the Ellendale, North Dakota data center campus\n- **Revenue Generation**: Applied Digital anticipates generating approximately $7 billion in total revenue from the initial leases\n- **Additional Capacity**: Additional 150MW lease agreement at Polaris Forge 1, with CoreWeave retaining options for further expansion\n\n### Infrastructure Development\n- **Polaris Forge 1**: First 100MW data center scheduled to be ready for service in Q4 of 2025, second 150MW building expected operational mid-2026\n- **Polaris Forge 2**: $5 billion lease agreement with a U.S. Based Investment Grade Hyperscaler covering 200 MW of critical IT load over an estimated 15-year term\n- **Total Capacity**: Total leased capacity across Polaris Forge 1 and 2 campuses has reached 600 MW\n- **Development Pipeline**: Development pipeline exceeds 4 gigawatts\n\n### Strategic Financing\n- **Macquarie Partnership**: Secured an initial $112.5 million draw from a $5 billion preferred equity facility with Macquarie Asset Management\n- **Total Project Capacity**: $5 billion preferred equity facility that could unlock $20 to $25 billion in total project financing capacity\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Direct Competitors\n- **IREN (formerly Iris Energy)**: Like Applied Digital, began as Bitcoin miners and pivoted toward AI infrastructure. IREN secured a landmark $9.7 billion contract with Microsoft in November 2025 for 200 MW of capacity\n- **Core Scientific (CORZ)**: Emerging powerhouse with foundational CoreWeave partnership including take-or-pay structure for up to 590MW of AI-focused capacity by 2027\n- **Riot Platforms**: Pivoting from blockchain hosting to high-density compute, leveraging Texas power infrastructure\n- **Equinix**: Global scale competitor retrofitting existing facilities for AI workloads while expanding purpose-built capacity\n\n### Competitive Advantages\n- **Power Access**: One of the biggest bottlenecks with building out AI infrastructure is the lack of power; Applied Digital was previously a Bitcoin miner, so it already had campuses with access to cheap, stable power\n- **Proprietary Cooling**: Proprietary cooling system targeting 1.18 power usage effectiveness with minimal water consumption\n- **Geographic Positioning**: With gigawatt-scale power secured in North Dakota, pioneering liquid-cooling standards, and a $16 billion contracted backlog, Applied Digital has built a competitive moat that's difficult to replicate\n\n## Market Environment & Industry Tailwinds\n\n### AI Infrastructure Boom\n- **Market Size**: The global AI infrastructure market is projected to grow from $182.07 billion in 2025 to $394.05 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 19.4%\n- **Hyperscaler Spending**: Public hyperscalers are projected to invest over $350 billion in AI data centers this year\n- **Power Constraints**: Energy availability has replaced GPU silicon as the primary limiting factor for AI expansion, with AI-related infrastructure spending potentially reaching $490 billion by 2026\n\n### Sector Headwinds\n- **High Capital Requirements**: Applied Digital operates with limited cash reserves relative to its debt obligations and capital-intensive development requirements\n- **Execution Risk**: Execution challenges remain as the company scales simultaneously across multiple sites, with timing dependent on construction timeline adherence\n- **Customer Concentration**: Main risk related to client concentration and contract stability with hyperscalers like CoreWeave\n\n## Analyst Coverage & Price Targets\n\n- **Consensus Rating**: According to 11 analysts, the average rating for APLD stock is \"Strong Buy\"\n- **Price Target Range**: 10 analysts with 12-month price forecasts have a median target of $39.5, with a low estimate of $7 and a high estimate of $45\n- **Recent Coverage**: Lake Street maintains a 'Buy' rating with a $45 price target; Citizens has an 'Outperform' rating with a $40 price target\n\n## Earnings Projections & Forecasts\n\n- **FY2026 Revenue Estimate**: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is $280.9 million, indicating 26.99% year-over-year growth\n- **Long-term Revenue Growth**: Analysts tracking APLD forecast revenue to increase from $215 million in fiscal 2025 to $970 million in fiscal 2028\n- **Path to Profitability**: Expected to narrow losses significantly, with EPS improving from negative $0.80 in fiscal 2025 to negative $0.31 in fiscal 2026, achieving positive EPS of $0.15 in fiscal 2027\n\n## Investment Thesis Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Strong positioning in rapidly growing AI infrastructure market\n- Secured $16 billion in contracted backlog providing revenue visibility\n- Strategic partnerships with major hyperscalers\n- Proprietary cooling technology and power access advantages\n- Management actively unlocking value through strategic initiatives\n\n**Risks:**\n- High customer concentration with CoreWeave\n- Significant capital requirements and execution risk\n- Current unprofitability and cash constraints\n- Premium valuation metrics\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n\n**Buy Rating: 7/10**\n\n**Rationale**: Applied Digital represents a compelling investment opportunity in the AI infrastructure boom with strong contracted revenue visibility and differentiated competitive positioning. The company's transformation from crypto mining to AI data centers, combined with secured power access and proprietary cooling technology, positions it well to capitalize on the $490 billion AI infrastructure buildout. However, execution risk, customer concentration, and premium valuation warrant moderate caution.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value**: $35.00\n\nBased on the company's contracted $16 billion backlog, growing AI infrastructure demand, and successful pivot to high-margin data center operations, a fair value of $35 represents reasonable upside from current levels while accounting for execution and concentration risks inherent in the business model.\n\n**Key Catalysts to Monitor**:\n- Q2 FY2026 earnings results (January 7, 2026)\n- ChronoScale spin-off completion (H1 2026)\n- Additional hyperscaler contract announcements\n- Polaris Forge construction milestones\n- Customer diversification progress",

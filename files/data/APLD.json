APLD stock has risen by 30.95% compared to the previous week, the month change is a 26.04% rise, over the last year Applied Digital Corporation has showed a 345.34% increase.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Data Center Hosting Business\nThe Data Center Hosting Business segment provides energized infrastructure services to crypto mining customers. Data Center Hosting revenue $41.6M Fiscal Q2 2026, up 15% from $36.2M in Q2 2025.\n\n### HPC Hosting Business\nThe HPC Hosting Business segment focuses on the designing, constructing, and operating data centers tailored to support high power density applications like HPC and AI. Applied Digital builds and operates high-performance data centers specifically designed for artificial intelligence workloads. The company has evolved from cryptocurrency mining hosting into what it calls \"AI Superfactories\"—facilities capable of housing the most power-dense computing clusters ever built. These data centers support rack densities exceeding 100 kilowatts, far beyond what traditional facilities can handle.\n\n### Cloud Services Business\nThe business generated a twelve-month revenue of approximately $75.2 million as of August 31, 2025, reflecting strong, growing demand from enterprise and AI-native customers for dedicated accelerated compute delivered through cloud-based platforms.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### ChronoScale Spin-off\nApplied Digital and EKSO Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced that they entered into a non-binding term sheet for a proposed business combination of Applied Digital's cloud computing business, Applied Digital Cloud, with EKSO, which, once closed, will go forward as ChronoScale Corporation, an accelerated compute platform purpose-built to support artificial intelligence (\"AI\") workloads. The Proposed Transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to the completion of customary due diligence, execution of final binding documents, customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, and satisfaction of closing conditions. ChronoScale would be purpose-built for dense GPU training and inference, leverage Applied Digital Cloud's early deployment of NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and be majority-owned (~97%) by Applied Digital upon closing.\n\n### Campus Expansion\nThe company plans to start construction on at least one new campus by the end of January, with high confidence that they're going to sign a lease with a new customer that is different from the original one signed in Harwood - an investment-grade hyperscaler. Management revealed a novel strategy to bypass industry-wide power bottlenecks by partnering with Babcock & Wilcox to utilize natural gas steam turbines, aiming to bring power online 3–4 years faster than competitors waiting for standard grid connections, with a pipeline of three additional sites totaling 900 megawatts in advanced discussions.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nApplied Digital believes it is on a projected annualized NOI run rate of approximately $500 million once Polaris Forge 1 is fully operational. The tenant signing at their second campus should put them firmly on the path toward their $1 billion NOI target within the next five years. At this trajectory, they believe they are positioned to become a leading force in the future of AI infrastructure and on track to evolve into the next AI-focused data center REIT as the business continues to mature. Applied Digital's development pipeline now exceeds 4 gigawatts, focused entirely on AI workloads. The recent announcement to spin out its cloud computing division into ChronoScale Corporation suggests management is getting more aggressive about unlocking value from different parts of the business.\n\n## 6.

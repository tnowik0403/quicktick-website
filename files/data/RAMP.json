In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Daily Volume (3-mo): 1.02 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (196 words)\nLiveRamp Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RAMP) is a global leader in data collaboration software, providing a full-stack identity resolution and data connectivity platform that enables enterprises to ethically connect, control, and activate first- and third-party customer data across silos. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, LiveRamp operates the RampID identity graph, which supports over 1 billion unique profiles globally, powering personalization, measurement, and marketing in a cookieless world. Core offerings include IdentityLink™ for deterministic identity resolution, IdentityLink Operated Platform (OLP) for managed services, and data marketplaces like Connect for secure data onboarding and collaboration.\n\nLiveRamp serves three primary segments: brands (e.g., retailers, financial services), agencies & media owners (e.g., publishers, DSPs), and tech platforms (e.g., cloud data warehouses). With a focus on privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), the company bridges walled gardens and open ecosystems, facilitating $8 trillion+ in annual addressable spend. FY2024 revenue reached $745.8 million (+10% YoY), driven by subscription models (87% of revenue).

Fundamentals show resilient growth (16% Q1 rev beat), undervalued at 2.1x EV/Rev (vs. sector 6x), with catalysts in Q2 earnings/Nov and cookie phaseout.

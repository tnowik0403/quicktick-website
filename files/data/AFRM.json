Growth Strategy\n\nAffirm (AFRM) is positioned for future revenue growth over the next 2-3 years, driven by several strategic initiatives and market expansions: Increased Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) from a Growing Base of Active Consumers and Merchants: Affirm continues to demonstrate significant growth in its core business metric, Gross Merchandise Volume. The company reported a record GMV of $10.8 billion in Q1 Fiscal Year 2026, marking a 42% increase from the prior year.

Management also highlighted expanding distribution through Worldpay for Platforms, giving Affirm access to more than 1,000 SaaS platforms, and adding new capital partners such as New York Life to its funding base.\n\n### Platform Diversification\nCan the Affirm Card and wallet integrations (Apple Pay, Shopify, Amazon) sustain high‑teens to 20%+ transaction growth even if e‑commerce growth slows?\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q1 FY 2026 Results\nAffirm Holdings reported Q1 2026 earnings with 33.6% revenue growth to $933.34M and $80.69M net income, reversing a $100.22M loss.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Consumer Demand**: Macro tailwinds: Consumers are increasingly using BNPL to manage tighter budgets, especially during the holidays, and merchants value the conversion and basket‑size lift.\n- **Demographic Shift**: As younger generations shift away from traditional credit, this stock is well-positioned to capitalize on the surge in buy-now, pay-later adoption.\n- **Financing Benefits**: In January 2025, Affirm expanded its capital partnership with Liberty Mutual Investments, which agreed to buy up to $750 million of loans initially and potentially invest up to $5 billion over time. In late 2024, PGIM Fixed Income (Prudential) privately purchased $500 million of Affirm loans.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Regulatory Pressure**: Macro and policy risks: BNPL is now squarely in regulators' crosshairs, and a weaker consumer cycle could test Affirm's underwriting and funding model. Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM) is heading into the final weeks of 2025 at the center of two opposite forces: booming \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) demand and rapidly intensifying regulatory scrutiny. In the last month alone, Affirm reported another profitable quarter, raised its fiscal 2026 guidance, signed a high-profile holiday partnership with Pacsun, and watched its CFO sell a large chunk of his equity — all while seven U.S. state attorneys general launched a coordinated probe of BNPL lenders, including Affirm.\n\n- **Economic Risks**: Sectors that rely on subprime or near-prime consumer credit (like Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) or Upstart) are facing a dual threat: borrowing costs remain real, and default rates are rising. We're seeing delinquency rates tick up in credit cards and auto loans. Sectors that rely on subprime or near-prime consumer credit (like Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) or Upstart) are facing a dual threat: borrowing costs remain real, and default rates are rising.\n\n- **Competition**: The author highlights competitive pressures in the BNPL space as a critical headwind. Companies like PayPal and Apple have entered the market with significant brand recognition, leading to increased pricing pressures and reduced market share for Affirm.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### U.S. BNPL Market Position\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, it is the largest U.S. based buy now, pay later (BNPL) financier. That same month, Affirm also stated it accounted for a third of the payment value and over half of the revenue in the U.S. BNPL sector.\n\nIn the U.S., Klarna was second to Afterpay for the second quarter, averaging 3.31 million monthly active users, while Affirm averaged 3.26 million. In the U.S., Klarna was second to Afterpay for the second quarter, averaging 3.31 million monthly active users, while Affirm averaged 3.26 million, according to the July BofA report.\n\n### Revenue Growth Leadership\nWhen it comes to revenue growth, Affirm was the fastest growing of the group at 46%, followed by Afterpay at 25% and Klarna at 24%. To put our growth rate in perspective, Affirm increased revenue by almost $900 million in 2024, exceeding Klarna's total U.S. revenue, their largest market.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors\nAffirm's main competitors are other BNPL providers like FinanceMutual, Klarna, Afterpay, Sezzle, Zip, and PayPal Pay Later. Klarna, Afterpay, and Affirm are leading BNPL services with different strengths.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nBut the denominator here included Affirm, and we never charge any late fees so the percentage is much higher for our competitors. However, Klarna generates quite a lot of revenue from the junk fees it charges consumers. To be exact, these junk fees accounted for $472 million in 2024, and comprised 17% of Klarna's total revenue and roughly half of their margins when adjusting their reporting to match Affirm's on an apples-to-apples basis.\n\nAffirm stands out from the pack given our performance on growth, margins, and scale. Among the providers analyzed, Affirm is growing both volume and revenue the fastest while maintaining significantly higher margins.\n\n### Market Position vs Major Players\nAfterpay, founded in Sydney and now owned by Block, was the biggest player in the U.S. market for the second quarter, based on Bank of America Securities data for monthly active users, though the data didn't include PayPal. Globally, Stockholm-based Klarna was the BNPL leader by that measure for the period.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Strategic Partnerships\n- **New York Life**: Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) expanded its long-term capital partnership with New York Life on October 31, 2025.

(AFRM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of November 7, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $62.50\n- **Market Capitalization**: $19.85 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $22.20 - $82.53\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $20.41 billion\n\n## Company Overview\nAffirm Holdings, Inc. (AFRM) is a leading financial technology company specializing in Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solutions, enabling consumers to split purchases into interest-free or interest-bearing installment payments at the point of sale. Founded in 2012 by Max Levchin (co-founder of PayPal), Affirm went public in January 2021 via direct listing on Nasdaq. The company partners with over 29,000 merchants, including major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Peloton, and Shopify, processing transactions across e-commerce, in-store, and app-based purchases. Affirm's core offering is transparent, no-hidden-fees financing with fixed payments, distinguishing it from credit cards by avoiding compounding interest and late fees. It uses machine learning for credit underwriting, approving ~86% of applicants while managing delinquency rates below 3%. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), Affirm reported record GMV of $28.6 billion (up 46% YoY), revenue of $2.32 billion (up 46% YoY), and active consumers reaching 21 million (up 26% YoY). The company is expanding into banking services via its 2023 acquisition of Returnly and deepening integrations like Apple Pay Later alternatives. Amid BNPL sector growth (projected to $450B+ globally by 2026 per McKinsey), Affirm faces regulatory scrutiny but benefits from consumer shift to flexible payments post-pandemic.

DCF model (25% GMV CAGR to 2028, 10% WACC, 15% terminal growth) + peers (8x sales multiple). Moderate risk: Volatility from macro, but profitability path by FY2026. Target 12-18 months.",

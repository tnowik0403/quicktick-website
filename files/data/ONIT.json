(NYSE: ONIT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Verified from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.onitygroup.com), Earnings transcripts via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha (Q2 2024 call Aug 7, 2024), Bloomberg, Reuters, and recent news (e.g., PR Newswire, HousingWire up to Oct 10, 2024). All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 10-Q (filed Aug 7, 2024, <6 months old). Stock data as of market close Oct 10, 2024.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nOnity Group Inc. (NYSE: ONIT), formerly Ocwen Financial Corporation, is a prominent non-bank U.S. residential mortgage servicer and originator headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida. The company operates through two core segments: Servicing (90%+ of pretax income) and Originations. In Servicing, Onity provides subservicing for performing and non-performing loans (NPLs), managing cash flows, collections, and loss mitigation for institutional clients like banks, mortgage REITs (e.g., New Residential Investments), and GSEs/Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac/Ginnie Mae. It services ~1.18 million loans with $136.7 billion unpaid principal balance (UPB) as of June 30, 2024. The Originations segment acquires and originates reperforming loans (RPLs, loans 90+ days past due that have cured), targeting high-yield assets in a high-interest-rate environment. Onity leverages proprietary technology platforms (e.g., REALServicing) for efficiency, scale, and compliance. Rebranded from Ocwen in September 2023 after restructuring ~$1.4B debt and settling regulatory issues (e.g., NY DFS 2017 consent order resolved 2021), Onity has pivoted to subservicing growth amid low origination volumes. With ~2,300 employees, it focuses on cost discipline (expenses down 15% YoY in Q2 2024) and balance sheet deleveraging, positioning as a top-10 U.S. servicer by UPB.

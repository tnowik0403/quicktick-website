In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(NYSE: ONTF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time web search conducted via Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.on24.com), Edgar SEC filings, earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 call Aug 7, 2024), recent articles (Motley Fool, Benzinga, PR Newswire up to Oct 10, 2024), Twitter/StockTwits discussions, Reddit (r/stocks, r/pennystocks).

(ONTF) is a pioneer in intelligent digital engagement platforms, enabling B2B marketers and sales teams to drive pipeline growth through interactive virtual experiences. Founded in 1999 and public since Feb 2021 via SPAC merger, ON24's core offering is a cloud-based platform for webinars, virtual events, and multimedia content delivery. It serves enterprises with tools for audience engagement (e.g., polls, AI chat), personalization, analytics, and CRM integrations (Salesforce, Marketo). The company targets high-value sectors like tech, pharma, finance, and manufacturing, emphasizing annual recurring revenue (ARR) from subscriptions. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30), ON24 reported ARR of $48.1M, down 13% YoY amid macro headwinds, but with improving enterprise metrics (115 customers >$100K ARR). Recent AI enhancements position it for recovery in a $8B+ webinar/virtual events market (Statista 2024 est.).

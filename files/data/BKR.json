BKR reported Q3 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68. This exceeded analysts' expectations of $0.62 by 9.68%, marking a Beat.\n\nBaker Hughes generated a free cash flow of $699 million compared with $754 million a year ago. BKR's net capital expenditure in the second quarter was $230 million. As of Sept. 30, 2025, it had cash and cash equivalents of $2,693 million.\n\n### 2024 Performance\nIn 2024, Baker Hughes Company's revenue was $27.83 billion, an increase of 9.11% compared to the previous year's $25.51 billion. Earnings were $2.98 billion, an increase of 53.32%.\n\n### Key Metrics\nBaker Hughes Company EBITDA is ‪4.68 B‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is 16.23%. BKR had a long-term debt of $5,988 million at the end of the reported quarter, with a debt-to-capitalization of 24.8%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **LNG Supercycle**: The \"Age of Gas\" remains the dominant macro driver for Baker Hughes. Despite the global push for renewables, natural gas is increasingly viewed as the essential transition fuel, particularly in Europe and Asia. This has led to a sustained period of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for LNG projects globally.\n\n- **Record IET Backlog**: This performance pushed the segment's Remaining Performance Obligations to a record $32.1 billion, providing multi-year revenue visibility and operational predictability.\n\n- **Data Center Growth**: The company booked significant orders, including $800 million in power generation-related orders this quarter, with strong pipelines across oil and gas and industrial markets.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Cost Inflation**: The biggest cost pressures are in the OFSE segment, where margins have softened due to cost inflation and a challenging business mix, even as the company pursues structural cost-out initiatives.\n\n- **North American Market Challenges**: With roughly 40% of its revenue tied to North American shale, Halliburton is highly sensitive to the domestic slowdown (note: this refers to industry conditions affecting all players).\n\n- **Trade Policy Risks**: Supply chain management and the resultant cost inflation, particularly from international tariffs, represent a material risk that impacts Baker Hughes' financial outlook. Broad tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum imports, directly elevate the manufacturing cost of essential equipment like drill pipes, casings, and compressors.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThese three companies, often referred to as the \"Big Three,\" dominate the global oilfield services market, with Schlumberger holding approximately 25% market share, Halliburton around 20%, and Baker Hughes approximately 15%.\n\nMarket share analysis shows Schlumberger leads with over 31% in the energy sector, while Halliburton maintains a solid 7%. However, Baker Hughes has maintained a competitive edge in LNG due to its long-standing relationships with national oil companies (NOCs) and its integrated service model.\n\nBaker Hughes is positioning itself uniquely in the industrial energy technology space, where it faces different competitive dynamics compared to traditional oilfield services.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Positioning Against Big Three Rivals\nWhile Schlumberger (SLB) remains the \"gold standard\" for digital oilfield technology and deepwater services, and Halliburton (HAL) dominates in hydraulic fracturing and U.S. land services, Baker Hughes has essentially carved out a new category.\n\nBy diversifying away from pure oilfield services, BKR has lowered its \"beta\" relative to crude oil prices compared to its rivals. Since then, the stock has outperformed its primary peers, Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), largely because of its lower sensitivity to volatile U.S. shale drilling activity and its higher exposure to the \"LNG super-cycle\" and industrial technology.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nBaker Hughes demonstrates a strong commitment to the energy transition. They prioritize sustainable practices and have made notable advancements in renewable energy technologies. Baker Hughes actively invests in clean energy solutions such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, and electrification of operations.\n\nThe company's diversified portfolio and strategic pivot toward industrial technology differentiate it from pure-play oilfield services companies.\n\n## 11.

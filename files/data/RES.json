(NYSE: RES) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $5.72 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.30 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $5.43 - $9.39  \n**P/E Ratio (TTM):** 9.82  \n**EV/EBITDA:** 4.15  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRPC, Inc. (RES) is a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in the exploration, production, and development of oil and gas properties across the United States, primarily onshore in key basins like the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Haynesville, with some exposure in the Gulf of Mexico. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, RPC operates through two main segments: Technical Services (approximately 65% of revenue) and Support Services (35%). Technical Services includes hydraulic fracturing (fracking), high-pressure pumping, acidizing, cementing, and coiled tubing. Support Services encompasses rental tools (e.g., high-spec tools for drilling/completions), fishing, pipe recovery, well intervention, and fluid management (e.g., saltwater disposal). The company focuses on niche, technology-enabled services emphasizing efficiency, safety, and cost savings for clients amid volatile E&P activity. With a fleet of ~30 fracturing fleets (down from peaks), RPC benefits from its Jetta Frac platform for simultaneous fracturing operations. In a cyclical industry, RPC's lean cost structure and ~20% adjusted EBITDA margins (pre-Q2 2024 weakness) position it for leverage during upcycles. However, it faces headwinds from reduced drilling/completions due to low natural gas prices and E&P capital discipline. RPC serves ~80% land-based operations, differentiating from offshore-heavy peers.

Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Daily Volume   | 12,500 shares |\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nDaily Journal Corporation (DJCO), founded in 1987 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, operates as a technology and publishing company serving the legal and justice sectors. Its core businesses span two segments: the declining Traditional Business and the high-growth Journal Technologies division. The Traditional Business publishes daily and weekly legal newspapers (e.g., Daily Journal in Southern/Northern California, San Francisco Daily Journal, and Asian Journal), along with commercial printing and legal ad services—generating ~60% of revenues but facing secular decline from digital media shifts. Journal Technologies, the growth engine (~40% of revenues), develops and supports SaaS-based case management software for courts, prosecutors, public defenders, and justice agencies. Flagship products include eCourt® (integrated repository for filings, calendaring, and workflows) and eProsecutor®, deployed in 40+ U.S. states and internationally (e.g., Philippines, Australia). DJCO also maintains a ~$400M+ portfolio of marketable securities (primarily U.S. equities like Bank of America, Wells Fargo), providing ~30-50% of earnings via dividends, interest, and gains. With ~1.37M shares outstanding, strong liquidity ($200M+ cash equivalents), and no debt, DJCO trades as a \"mini-Berkshire\" due to late Chairman Charlie Munger's influence (died Nov 28, 2023). FY2024 revenues totaled ~$58M, with Journal Technologies recurring SaaS revenues growing 15-20% annually.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 12, 2024**: Reported Q4 FY2024 (ended Sep 30, 2024) earnings—total revenues $14.3M (up 8.3% YoY from $13.2M); Journal Technologies revenues $6.1M (up 11%); net income $4.2M or $3.06/share.

(PLNT) is the largest low-cost fitness club franchisor in North America, operating under the \"Judgement Free Zone\" brand targeting first-time and casual gym-goers with affordable $10/month memberships (Classic) and premium Black Card options ($24.99/month including spa access, guest privileges, and massage chairs). Founded in 1992 and public since 2015, PLNT operates ~2,500 locations (2,238 franchised, 262 corporate-owned as of Q2 2024) primarily in the U.S. (93% of revenue), with expansion into Canada, Mexico, Spain, Poland, and Australia. The franchise-heavy model (94% franchised) drives high margins via royalties (6-7% of franchise SSB), equipment sales, and fees. Q2 2024 revenue hit $232.7M (+14.8% YoY), with net income $50.1M and adjusted EBITDA $105.8M (margin 45.5%). System-wide membership reached 19.6M (+594K YoY), fueled by same-store sales +9.4%. PLNT capitalizes on post-pandemic health trends, luring price-sensitive millennials/Gen Z with no-contract access, cardio/strength equipment (no heavy barbells), and community events. Risks include economic sensitivity, but sticky low churn (36-month avg tenure) and digital app (7.5M+ users) bolster retention.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 1, 2024:** Q2 Earnings – Revenue $232.7M (vs. $220.8M exp.), EPS $0.59 (vs. $0.53 exp.).

Sell if recession deepens.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $85 (18% upside) – DCF (10% WACC, 12% growth 5-yr taper to 4%; terminal 3%). Moderate risk: Franchise model buffers downturns, but consumer cyclicality caps at moderate appetite. Target multiple expansion to 25x fwd P/E on 2025 EPS $2.45 est.",

Founded in 1990 and headquartered in Ooltewah, Tennessee, the company designs, engineers, manufactures, and distributes a comprehensive range of products including wreckers (light-, medium-, and heavy-duty), car carriers, rotators, transport trailers, and aftermarket accessories. Operating under iconic brands such as Century, Vulcan, Chevron, and Holme, MLR serves professional tow operators, government agencies (e.g., police, fire departments), fleet operators, and construction firms. With manufacturing facilities in Tennessee, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, the UK, Australia, and France (via JV), the company benefits from a vertically integrated supply chain and a robust dealer network spanning 50+ U.S. states and 40+ countries. In FY2023, MLR reported record revenues driven by strong demand for fleet replacements amid an aging U.S. tow truck population (average age ~15 years).

Growth Strategy\n\n### 2030 Strategic Vision\nBlackRock's 2030 ambition is rooted in its role as a fiduciary to its clients, leveraging its scale and technology to connect investors to the long-term growth of capital markets. We've built BlackRock around structural growth, meaning the products and services that benefit from fundamental advancements; the durable, long-term changes in how clients are using BlackRock as a platform, a scale enabler to manage and grow their businesses. We're executing to expand share in all these structural growers. We're top five in private credit and SMAs, top three in each of infrastructure, cash and outsourcing. And we're number one in both ETFs and our Aladdin technology platform.\n\n### AI and Technology Focus\nWe see AI capital spending still supporting growth in 2026, with the contribution to U.S. growth from investment totalling three times its historical average this year. This capital-intensive boost is likely to persist into next year, allowing growth to hold up even as the labor market keeps cooling.\n\nBlackRock continues to view AI as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle. Infrastructure spending remains elevated, while productivity gains and earnings growth are backed by AI-related investments. The firm does not see the theme as nearing exhaustion.\n\n## 6.

Its $12.5 trillion in AUM as of June 30, 2025, significantly outpaces competitors like Vanguard and Fidelity.\n\n### Technology Advantage\nBlackRock's competitive landscape is defined by its robust technological infrastructure, particularly the Aladdin platform.

Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Major 2025 Acquisitions\n\n#### HPS Investment Partners\nOn July 1, 2025, BlackRock completed the acquisition of HPS Investment Partners, adding $165 billion of client AUM and $118 billion of fee-paying AUM. By acquiring HPS, BlackRock expects to create a combined private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets. The deal is expected to close in mid-2025.\n\n#### ElmTree Funds\nBlackRock has successfully completed its acquisition of ElmTree Funds (\"ElmTree\"). The addition of ElmTree will further elevate BlackRock's Private Financing Solutions (PFS) platform as one of the industry's premier providers of comprehensive solutions for companies and investors alike.\n\n#### Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)\nThe timeline of this ascent was accelerated by the full integration of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which added $170 billion in assets.\n\n### Private Financing Solutions (PFS) Platform\nTo fully capture the opportunities created by this combination, BlackRock is creating Private Financing Solutions (PFS), which will combine the firms' market-leading private credit, GP and LP solutions, and private and liquid CLO businesses into one integrated platform. Together, PFS will advance BlackRock's ability to create a more seamless experience for investors and borrowers, while offering a platform that is well equipped to identify and execute on a broad array of opportunities created by this market evolution.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Performance Highlights\n$205 billion of quarterly total net inflows led by a record quarter for iShares® ETFs, alongside private markets and cash net inflows. 10% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter reflects broad-based strength across iShares ETFs, systematic active equities, private... That growth is even more notable in its diversification. Top organic base fee growth contributors included our systematic franchise, private markets, digital assets, outsourcing, cash and iShares ETFs, which saw record.\n\n### Investment in AI and Digital Assets\nBlackRock is a foundational player in the digital asset ecosystem. The US needs to accelerate regulatory clarity and investments in digital assets innovation.\n\n### Global Expansion\nIn India, our Jio BlackRock joint venture recently launched its first systematic active equity offering, building on our already high-performing global systematic franchise. The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through Jio BlackRock, we're enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies, in their local financial assets, and we're helping them build towards a more secure financial future.\n\n### 2026 Outlook\nAs BlackRock prepares to unveil its Q4 2025 results, the key takeaway is the firm's evolution from a volume-driven index giant to a margin-driven alternative powerhouse. The anticipated $14 trillion AUM milestone is a testament to the firm's ability to capture the massive shift of capital toward private markets and infrastructure. While the recent 1% staff reduction reflects a disciplined approach to cost management, the real story remains the firm's aggressive M&A strategy and its dominance in the ETF space.\n\n## 12.

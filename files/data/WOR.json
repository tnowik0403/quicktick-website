(NYSE: WOR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $74.52\n- Market Capitalization: $3.62 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $44.33 - $81.04\n- Average Daily Volume (10-day): 313,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nWorthington Enterprises, Inc. (WOR) is a diversified metals manufacturing company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, specializing in innovative metal products for consumer, industrial, and sustainable energy applications. Following the tax-free spin-off of its largest Steel Processing segment as Worthington Steel Company (NYSE: WS) on December 29, 2023, WOR has pivoted to a leaner portfolio emphasizing high-margin, growth-oriented businesses. The company now operates primarily through two segments: Sustainable Energy Solutions (SES, ~25% of FY24 revenue) and Consumer Products (CP, ~75%). SES designs and manufactures large-scale, modular hydrogen storage and transportation systems, positioning WOR at the forefront of the global clean energy transition. CP produces pressure cylinders for consumer propane (e.g., BBQ grills), industrial gases, and helium balloons, leveraging a strong North American market presence. With ~4,500 employees across 30+ facilities in the US, Europe, and Poland, WOR generated FY24 net sales of $1.22 billion (verified Q4 FY24 earnings, August 28, 2024 release). The company prioritizes sustainability, innovation, and shareholder returns, distributing $200 million in special dividends post-spin-off and maintaining a robust balance sheet with $217 million in cash and low net debt. WOR's strategic shift targets the $100B+ hydrogen economy by 2030, while defending mature cylinder markets amid cyclical industrial demand.

Rationale: Undervalued H2 exposure (P/E 15x fwd vs. sector 18x), pristine balance sheet, 20-30% upside to catalysts amid energy transition megatrend. Moderate risk from cyclical CP offset by SES ramp.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $92** (25% upside from $74.52). DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth; SES 25% CAGR assumption) + 20% premium for M&A potential. Hold if risk-averse; Sell below $65 support.",

(KRT) is a leading North American manufacturer and supplier of single-use disposable foodservice packaging products, catering to the commercial foodservice, restaurant, and retail sectors. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the company offers a broad portfolio including paper and plastic cups, lids, take-out containers, cutlery, straws, bags, wraps, foils, and portion cups. Karat sells primarily through national, regional, and independent foodservice distributors, reaching end-users like quick-service restaurants (QSRs), casual dining chains, and grocery retailers. With vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, and China, Karat emphasizes innovation in sustainable materials (e.g., compostable and recyclable options) amid shifting regulations. In 2023, it generated $484M in revenue, focusing on private-label and branded products. The company benefits from the persistent takeout/delivery trend post-COVID but faces pressures from eco-conscious shifts and commodity volatility. Karat went public in 2021 via SPAC merger and has pursued growth through acquisitions and product diversification, positioning itself as a nimble player in a fragmented $20B+ U.S. disposables market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 12, 2024):** Net sales $36.5M (↓2.4% YoY); Gross profit $10.8M (29.6% margin, ↓ from 32.1%); Net income $3.8M (EPS $0.19); Adjusted EBITDA $6.9M (18.9% margin).

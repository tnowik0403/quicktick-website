(NYSE: XPEL) is a leading global developer, manufacturer, and distributor of automotive and architectural surface protection films, primarily known for its Paint Protection Film (PPF), window tinting films, and vehicle wrap solutions. Founded in 1997 and headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, the company serves the automotive aftermarket, serving installers, dealerships, and end consumers worldwide through a network of over 1,600 certified installers and distributors across 80+ countries. XPEL's core products protect vehicle exteriors from rock chips, scratches, UV damage, and weathering, while also offering aesthetic enhancements like ceramic window tints and color-changing wraps.\n\nThe company's growth has been driven by brand recognition (e.g., \"XPEL Ultimate Plus\" PPF), proprietary design software (DesignAccess), and a vertically integrated model including in-house R&D, manufacturing facilities in North America and Asia, and direct-to-consumer e-commerce. In recent years, XPEL has expanded beyond automotive into architectural films for buildings and industrial applications, though autos remain ~90% of revenue. With a focus on premium, high-margin products (gross margins historically 50%+), XPEL benefits from rising demand for vehicle personalization amid luxury SUV/EV booms. However, it faces cyclical pressures from auto sales slowdowns. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024; reported August 7, 2024), XPEL reported revenue of $87.3 million (down 1% YoY), net income of $15.2 million (down 20% YoY), and gross margin of 58.1%, reflecting resilience amid U.S. market softness but strength in international sales (up 20% YoY). Market cap stands at $525.6 million with shares outstanding at ~27.7 million.

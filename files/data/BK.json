BNY operates through two primary franchises: Securities Services (including custody and clearing for ~$50.7 trillion in assets under custody/administration as of Q3 2024) and Market and Wealth Services (collateral management, data/analytics via BNY Pershing, and wealth platforms). Its Investment Management arm oversees ~$2.0 trillion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBNY differentiates through scale, technology-driven solutions, and a neutral, multi-asset class platform, handling complex post-trade processing for 800+ markets. It processes trillions in daily transactions, powering ~35% of U.S. equities volume via Pershing. Amid rising geopolitical tensions and regulatory scrutiny, BNY emphasizes resilience, with 90%+ recurring fee revenue. Recent focus on AI, data analytics (e.g., BNY Data Vault), and digital assets positions it for secular growth in a fragmented $140+ trillion global custody market.

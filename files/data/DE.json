Iconic for its green-and-yellow John Deere branded tractors, combines, and planters, the company generates ~70% of revenue from agriculture and turf (large ag equipment ~50%, small ag & turf ~20%), ~25% from construction & forestry, and ~5% from financial services. In FY2023 (ended Oct 29, 2023), Deere reported $61.25 billion in net sales, serving farmers, builders, and landscapers globally through ~2,900 dealer locations in 140+ countries. The firm invests heavily in precision agriculture (\"See & Spray\", autonomous tractors) and sustainability (low-emission engines, electric prototypes), leveraging its ~$7 billion annual R&D spend. Deere's dominance stems from its ~50% U.S. market share in high-horsepower tractors (>100 HP), superior dealer network, and software ecosystem (John Deere Operations Center). Facing cyclical ag demand tied to crop prices and farm incomes, Deere has pivoted to recurring software revenues (up 30% YoY in recent quarters) and autonomy to drive margin expansion amid inventory destocking.

Founded in 1953, the company specializes in full-service, casual dining with a 24/7 \"Always Open\" model, emphasizing affordable American comfort food—particularly breakfast staples like pancakes, Grand Slams, and skillets—served all day alongside burgers, salads, and value-oriented promotions. Denny's generates revenue primarily through franchise royalties (about 70% of total), food distribution to franchisees, and company-operated restaurant sales. As of Q2 2024, the company operated 352 restaurants (down from prior years due to closures) and franchised 1,246. In March 2024, Denny's expanded via the $82.5 million acquisition of Keke's Breakfast Cafe (82 locations, premium breakfast focus), aiming to diversify into higher-margin daytime dining. Facing macroeconomic pressures, Denny's is undergoing a \"Guest First\" transformation, including aggressive unit closures of underperformers (target: 150+ by end-2025), remodels, digital enhancements, and franchise conversions to boost profitability. Total revenue has hovered around $1.8-1.9B annually, but same-store sales have declined amid inflation and competition.

Financial Data & Performance\n\nTotal revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 10% to $1.5 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Constant currency organic revenue growth from continuing operations for the second quarter was 9%.

Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose by 15% to $2.47. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2026 was strong at $527.7 million, driven by increased earnings and improvements in working capital.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\nIncluded in this outlook is the negative impact of tariffs, estimated to reduce pre-tax profit by approximately $45 million, unchanged from prior outlook. With nearly 30% of the company's revenues and costs of revenues being generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact STE's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. For instance, ongoing geopolitical instability, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economies, leading to supply-chain disruptions, rising interest rates, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, and heightened cybersecurity risks.\n\n### Tailwinds:\nThe sterilization equipment market is driven by the growing number of surgeries, rising incidence of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and increasing outsourcing of sterilization services among pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given time, seven patients in developed countries and ten patients in developing countries acquire at least one healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired infection.\n\nThis strong trajectory reflects rising healthcare-associated infection (HAI) rates, growing global surgical volumes, and the heightened focus on sterile processing—particularly in medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturing. As outsourcing becomes a preferred model for efficient, cost-effective sterilization, the industry is undergoing strategic transformation, technological modernization, and regulatory evolution.\n\n## 9.

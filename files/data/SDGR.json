(NASDAQ: SDGR) is a leading physics-based computational platform provider revolutionizing drug discovery and advanced materials development. Founded in 1990 and public since 2020, the company leverages Nobel Prize-winning physics simulations to predict molecular behaviors with atomic accuracy, enabling faster, cost-effective R&D. Its core platform integrates physics-based modeling, machine learning, and enterprise tools to optimize small-molecule drug design and materials innovation.\n\nIn drug discovery, Schrödinger's software accelerates hit identification, lead optimization, and clinical candidate selection, reducing failure rates in pharma pipelines. Key applications include kinase inhibitors, PROTACs, and biologics. In materials science, it designs high-performance batteries, semiconductors, and polymers for clients like Panasonic and LG Chem. The platform spans cloud, on-premise, and hybrid deployments, with a growing drug discovery services business where Schrödinger co-develops candidates, retaining milestones and royalties.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Schrödinger serves 25% of the top 20 pharma companies, powering over 100 preclinical programs. Revenue is bifurcated: ~80% recurring software licenses/subscriptions (e.g., FEP+, Desmond), ~20% drug discovery services. The company targets a $100B+ addressable market in computational R&D, amid AI hype, but differentiates via validated physics over black-box ML. Recent guidance raises signal strong momentum, positioning SDGR for 15-20% CAGR through hybrid physics-AI workflows.

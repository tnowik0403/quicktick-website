Daily Volume: 298K shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMerchants Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBIN) is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana, founded in 1996 and publicly traded since 2014. It operates primarily through three segments: Multi-Family Mortgage Banking (40-50% of earnings), Mortgage Warehouse Lending (30-40%), and Banking (20-30%). The company specializes in niche lending, including originating, purchasing, and servicing multifamily housing and healthcare facility loans delegated to GSEs (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA). It provides mortgage warehouse lines of credit to mortgage lenders nationwide and traditional banking services like commercial real estate (CRE) loans, retail deposits, and wealth management via its Merchants Bank of Indiana subsidiary. With total assets exceeding $21B as of Q2 2024, MBIN has built a reputation for high-ROE execution (20%+), low delinquencies (<0.1% in multifamily), and scalable platforms. It avoids consumer retail banking scale, focusing instead on high-margin, agency-backed lending and warehouse facilities, positioning it as a \"fintech-like\" bank with deposit growth from fintech partnerships. Recent profitability stems from net interest margins (NIM) of 3.0%+ amid rising rates, though CRE exposure introduces volatility. MBIN serves over 1,000 warehouse clients and has originated $50B+ in multifamily loans since inception, emphasizing delegated underwriting authority (DUA) for GSEs.

Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, it operates as one of North America's largest publishers of podcasts, with a portfolio exceeding 130 professionally produced shows across genres including true crime (e.g., *My Favorite Murder*, *Vince Coglianese Show*), comedy (*The Adam Carolla Show*), business/finance (*The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show*), health/wellness, and pop culture. The company generates revenue primarily through advertising sales (dynamic ad insertion tech), podcast production/distribution via platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify, direct-to-consumer subscriptions, and premium content deals. In April 2024, PodcastOne spun off from parent LiveOne, Inc. (LVO), becoming independently listed to focus on scaling its ad-supported model amid booming digital audio consumption. With over 1 billion lifetime downloads and top-ranked shows (e.g., 5 in Apple Podcasts Top 100 as of Q4 FY2024), PODC leverages proprietary ad tech for targeted insertions, serving advertisers like Procter & Gamble and legal firms.

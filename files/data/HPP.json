Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, HPP owns approximately 47.4 million square feet of properties as of Q2 2024, split between ~19 million sq ft of office space (40% of portfolio) and ~28 million sq ft of studio/production soundstage space (60%). The office portfolio targets tech and media tenants in gateway markets like Silicon Valley, SoMa (SF), and Downtown LA, with key assets such as 1800 Owens (SF) and Pacific Design Center (LA). The studio segment, under brands like Sunset Bronson and Bayside (Vancouver), serves Hollywood studios and streaming giants, benefiting from the shift to on-demand content production. HPP generates revenue primarily from leasing (95%+ occupancy pre-downturn), with diversification into life sciences flex space. Amid office market headwinds from remote work and tech layoffs, HPP has pivoted toward studio strength and non-core asset sales, reporting $215.8 million in Q2 2024 revenue (verified from July 30, 2024 earnings release). The company aims for portfolio optimization in high-growth creative/tech ecosystems, positioning as a \"pure-play\" owner of irreplaceable real estate.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 30, 2024)**: Revenue $215.8M (down 23% YoY from $280.0M); FFO as adjusted $0.19/share (missed consensus $0.24); net loss $86.5M due to impairment charges.

Potential studio tuck-ins eyed (rumored per Barron's Sept 2024).\n- **Recent**: Amended credit facility with JPMorgan (October 2024, extended maturities).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current (Top 10 = 35% rent)**: Google (SF offices), Netflix/Amazon (studios), Disney, Apple, Riot Games.\n- **Potential**: Expansion with streaming (HBO Max, Apple TV+ pilots); life sciences (Genentech interest per Q2 call); AI/tech returns (post-layoff stabilization).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: B+ MSCI rating; solar installations at 20% portfolio.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 7 Buys/8 Holds/2 Sells (consensus PT $7.50 per Yahoo Oct 2024); concerns on recession sensitivity.\n- **Risks**: Interest rates (AFFO coverage 1.4x); tenant defaults low (0.5% ABR).\n- **Opportunities**: WFH reversal (JLL predicts +500k SF absorption 2025); studio M&A wave.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Office distress caps upside; studios provide floor but debt and vacancies pressure near-term. Moderate risk appetite suits caution amid 2025 maturities.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $7.80 (45% upside). Based on 8x 2025E FFO ($0.95/share, per Green Street model adjusted for dispositions/studio growth); DCF implies $8.20 at 7% cap rate on stabilized NOI. Strong growth requires 95%+ occupancy and $600M sales execution.",

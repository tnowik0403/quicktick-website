Expansion of product series like ATOMIC COMPACT SERIES™ for enhanced user experience. Craftsman Repositioning: New products are anticipated to drive growth by late 2026 or early 2027.\n\nAI and centralized engineering are being leveraged to enhance customer service and speed up product development.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe company is prioritizing investment in its core brands, notably DEWALT, Stanley, and Craftsman. DEWALT, a significant growth engine, has demonstrated consistent strong performance, achieving its eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth as of Q1 2025. By the close of 2025, Stanley Black & Decker intends to allocate between $300 million and $500 million to strategic growth initiatives.\n\nStrategic allocation of $300 million to $500 million for growth initiatives by end of 2025. Focus on North American manufacturing to optimize supply chain and reduce import dependency. Gross margins are expected to improve, with a target of 33-34% for 2025. The company aims to exceed 35% gross margin by the end of 2026.\n\nThe company is targeting at least $500 million in free cash flow for 2025. This target has been updated to approximately $600 million for the year.\n\nStanley Black & Decker aims to achieve a $2 billion cost reduction by year-end. The company is targeting a 35% margin expansion, despite recent setbacks due to tariffs. A strategic pruning, possibly involving the aerospace fastening business, is planned to achieve a 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA ratio.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nPartners · Lowes, Home Depot, Grainger, Fastenal and MSC Industrial Home Depot and Lowe's the largest retail customers for Stanley Black & Decker.\n\nStanley Black & Decker, a prominent manufacturer of power tools, chooses not to sell its products directly to customers primarily to avoid channel conflict with retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's. By not engaging in direct sales, Stanley Black & Decker supports its retail partners, ensuring that these outlets continue to carry their products and promote them effectively. This is a critical element in maintaining strong relationships with retailers who provide vital access to a broad customer base.\n\nSTANLEY announces today that The Home Depot will now be the exclusive home improvement retailer for its STANLEY hand tools and storage product portfolio, both in store and online, beginning in 2019. Following the acquisition by Stanley Black & Decker, Craftsman tools and equipment began to appear on the shelves of other major retailers. One of the most notable partnerships was with Lowes, a home improvement retailer that competes directly with Home Depot. Lowes began carrying a wide selection of Craftsman products, both in its physical stores and on its website.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nChristopher J. Nelson, Stanley Black & Decker's President & CEO, commented, \"Stanley Black & Decker delivered solid third quarter results, despite prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our performance included continued growth in our DEWALT brand, year over year gross margin expansion and solid free cash flow.\n\nStanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK, Financial) achieved a 110 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin year-over-year, reaching 31.6%, driven by disciplined pricing strategies and supply chain efficiencies. The company is on track to deliver a $2 billion cost reduction by the end of 2025, which is expected to enhance profitability and support growth investments.\n\nStanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK) generated $155 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, contributing to its full-year objective of $600 million. Total revenue for the third quarter was flat year-over-year at $3.8 billion, with a 1% organic decline due to a 6% decrease in volume.\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance cut due to fleeting production costs: The 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance was revised downward by $0.10 to $4.55 due to \"higher production costs\" management expects to normalize in Q4.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\nThe company faced challenges from a persistently soft consumer backdrop, impacting overall demand. Tariff-related promotional reductions within the retail channel contributed to a 7% decrease in volume for the Tools & Outdoor segment. Adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2025 was reduced by $0.10 due to higher-than-anticipated production costs from tariff-related volume softness and supply chain changes.\n\nThe company faces significant challenges, including the impact of U.S. tariffs, which are projected to reduce 2025 earnings per share by approximately $0.75.\n\nIntense price competition from TTI and other low-cost manufacturers continues to erode margins and challenge Stanley Black & Decker's market share.\n\n### Tailwinds:\nDEWALT brand continues to show strong momentum with revenue expansion across all product lines and regions, supported by targeted investments in innovation and market activation.\n\nIndustrial exposure provides robust growth and margin expansion: The Engineered Fastening segment grew organic revenues 5% and achieved a sequential adjusted segment margin expansion of 2.0%. This highlights the non-cyclical strength in key end markets like aerospace and automotive, confirming the benefit of segment diversification and providing a reliable base of high-quality growth.\n\nI dont think the tariff headwinds for the stock will be as strong as the rate cut regime tailwinds which should unlock the housing market.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket Share Dynamics: Ryobi held a 7.9% unit market share in power tools as of September 2023. DEWALT has shown consistent growth, with its eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Q1 2025.\n\nBlack & Decker leads the pack with a 14 percent market share and $7.14 billion in sales. Techtonic, which rounds out the Big Four controlling companies, has a 9.88% market share with $6 billion in sales.\n\nThe industry analysis reveals a sector in rapid transition, shaped by the accelerated shift to cordless platforms, which now represent over 50% of the North American professional power tools market.\n\nStanley Black & Decker is a dominant force in the global tools and storage industry, consistently securing its position among the world's top two manufacturers. The company's market position is built on a powerful multi-brand strategy that targets distinct customer segments, from industrial professionals to DIY enthusiasts.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nKey competitors include Robert Bosch GmbH, Techtronic Industries Co. Ltd., and Makita Corporation. These companies are major forces in the global tool market, driving innovation and competition.\n\nTTI is the primary rival, wielding brands like Milwaukee Tool and Ryobi. Its relentless innovation, especially in cordless battery technology, has driven significant market share gains in the professional segment, directly challenging Stanley Black & Decker's core business.\n\nStanley Black & Decker, Bosch, and Techtronic Industries collectively dominate premium price tiers but face share erosion from agile Chinese entrants employing regional assembly and price leadership.\n\nTechtronic Industries booked record USD 14.6 billion sales in 2024, leveraging Milwaukee's contractor loyalty and tapping AI-driven data-center construction.\n\nNotable Brands: DEWALT, Craftsman, Black+Decker, Cub Cadet, Stanley ...

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.\n\nChris Nelson, Stanley Black Decker's President CEO, stated, \"Divesting CAM reflects our ongoing dedication to enhancing shareholder value and focusing on growing our biggest brands and businesses. The proceeds from this transaction are expected to significantly reduce our debt, positioning us to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. After achieving this critical financial goal, we will have greater flexibility to pursue additional value-creation opportunities through a more agile capital allocation strategy.\n\n## 12.

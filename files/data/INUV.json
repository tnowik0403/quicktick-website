(INUV) is a Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based technology company specializing in digital advertising and marketing solutions, with a focus on privacy-first, AI-driven intent-based targeting. Founded in 1987 and public since 1993, Inuvo operates two core segments: (1) IntentKey®, an owned-and-operated platform that uses large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) to create hyper-targeted audience segments without relying on cookies or personal identifiers, enabling compliant advertising in a post-privacy era; and (2) the Platform161 exchange, acquired in 2021, a supply-side platform (SSP) that facilitates real-time bidding and programmatic ad transactions across display, video, mobile, and connected TV (CTV) channels. Inuvo serves advertisers, agencies, and publishers by monetizing audience data through intent signals derived from vast datasets (over 2 trillion signals analyzed). Revenue is primarily from advertising (95%+), with a small media segment. The company targets the $600B+ global digital ad market, emphasizing cookieless solutions amid regulatory shifts like GDPR and CCPA. Recent profitability stems from IntentKey scaling, with Q2 2024 marking the strongest quarter in company history. Inuvo positions itself as an innovator in ethical AI advertising, competing in a fragmented SSP/DSP landscape while expanding into emerging channels like CTV and retail media.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $26.6M (+27% YoY), gross profit $9.9M (37.2% margin), net income $3.9M ($0.03 EPS, first profitable Q since 2015).

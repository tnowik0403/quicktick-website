Founded in 1959 and headquartered in Plano, Texas, the company serves diverse end-markets including automotive (45% of revenue), industrial (25%), consumer electronics (15%), computing (10%), and communications (5%). DIOD operates 32 factories across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with a fabless model augmented by owned assembly/test facilities. It emphasizes high-volume, application-specific standards for power management, protection, sensing, and connectivity, targeting growth in electrification trends like EVs, ADAS, and industrial automation. In FY2023 (ended Dec 31, 2023), DIOD generated $1.7B in revenue, but FY2024 has faced cyclical headwinds from inventory corrections in consumer/computing segments. Strategic focus on automotive/industrial differentiation positions it for recovery, with ~70% of revenue from Asia but growing North American auto exposure.

(NASDAQ: RDI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $1.65 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $14.82 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, shares outstanding ~8.98 million)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.00 - $2.66  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nReading International, Inc. (RDI) is a diversified entertainment and real estate company headquartered in New York City, with operations spanning the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Founded in 1999 through a spin-off from The Crosby Estate, RDI primarily operates through two segments: Cinema Exhibition and Real Estate. In its Cinema Exhibition segment, RDI owns and/or operates approximately 90 theaters with around 700 screens under brands like Reading Cinemas, Angelika Film Center, and Consolidated Theatres. These include premium large-format screens, dine-in theaters, and luxury experiences targeting diverse audiences with first-run Hollywood films, arthouse, and international content. The Real Estate segment involves developing, owning, and managing properties, including live entertainment venues (e.g., Minetta Lane Theatre and Orpheum Theatre in NYC), retail centers, and multi-family residential projects like the Sutton Tower in Manhattan. RDI's strategy blends experiential entertainment with stable real estate income to mitigate cinema cyclicality. As of Q2 2024, the company reported total revenue of $66.7 million, with cinemas contributing ~90% but facing attendance headwinds post-COVID. Real estate provides diversification, with key assets generating rental income. RDI's small-cap status ($15M mcap) reflects industry challenges, but its international footprint and property development pipeline offer upside potential amid stabilizing box office trends.

Limited growth catalysts amid debt/dilution; suitable for speculative portfolios only. High risk from low liquidity and sector cyclicality outweighs modest Q3 upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $1.50 (35% upside from $1.12). Based on 0.8x FY2025E revenue ($60M at 12% growth, 5% EBITDA margin) discounted for risk; DCF implies $1.40-1.60 (moderate growth scenario, 15% IRR target). Not for strong growth upside seekers—prefer larger peers like IPG (1.2x EV/Rev). \n\n*Sources: Verified via Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, SEC EDGAR (10-Qs Aug/May 2024), company IR site, Seeking Alpha, PRWeek, Statista, Influencer Marketing Hub (all accessed real-time October 11, 2024).

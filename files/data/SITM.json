Daily Volume (10-day):** 421,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nSiTime Corporation is a leader in programmable silicon MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) timing solutions, revolutionizing the $5+ billion timing device market traditionally dominated by quartz crystals. Founded in 2005 and public since 2019, SiTime designs, manufactures, and sells ultra-precise, resilient timing products including oscillators, resonators, TCXOs (temperature-compensated oscillators), OCXOs (oven-controlled crystal oscillators), and clock generators. These enable synchronization in high-performance applications like AI data centers, 5G telecom, automotive ADAS, aerospace/defense, and consumer electronics. Unlike rigid quartz, SiTime's MEMS solutions offer 10x better reliability (no fractures from shock/vibration), smaller size, lower power, and factory programmability, reducing design cycles and BOM costs by up to 50%. In Q2 2024, revenue reached $55.8 million (verified from August 7, 2024 earnings release), driven by datacom (41% of revenue) and enterprise data centers amid AI boom. SiTime operates a fabless model with U.S.-based R&D in Santa Clara, CA, and production via TSMC and GlobalFoundries. With a $1.5B backlog as of Q2 2024 earnings call, SiTime is positioned for hypergrowth as MEMS penetrates quartz's 90%+ market share.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings beat expectations with revenue $55.8M (+55% YoY), non-GAAP gross margin 61.7%, non-GAAP EPS $0.43 (vs. consensus $0.26).

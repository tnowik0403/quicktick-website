(ENVA) is a Chicago-based financial technology company founded in 1999, specializing in online lending to non-prime consumers and small businesses overlooked by traditional banks. Operating in the US, UK, Brazil, and Australia, Enova uses proprietary machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and alternative credit scoring to originate and service loans digitally. Its platform processes real-time decisions for products like payday loans, installment loans, lines of credit, and vehicle financing under brands such as CashNetUSA, NetCredit, QuickQuid (UK), and SunnyDays (Brazil). In 2023, Enova pivoted toward higher-margin small business (SMB) lending via its OnDeck brand, acquired in 2020, which now contributes ~25% of revenues. The company reported record originations in Q3 2024, driven by portfolio expansion and yield improvements amid stabilizing consumer demand. With ~1,500 employees and a fully digital model (no physical branches), Enova benefits from low customer acquisition costs and scalability. Facing regulatory scrutiny in non-prime lending, it emphasizes compliance and tech innovation. FY2024 guidance projects 20-25% revenue growth, positioning Enova as a resilient player in the $50B+ US non-prime online lending market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released Oct 23, 2024)**: Revenues $693M (+26% YoY); GAAP Diluted EPS $2.77; Adjusted EPS $2.81; Originations $1.77B (+24% YoY); Ending receivables $2.50B (+26% YoY, corporate finance excluded).

Hold/sell only if recession deepens (unemployment >5%). Moderate risk: Regulatory/cyclical offset by SMB diversification.\n- **Fair Value Price Target: $110** (22% upside from $90.51). DCF-based (10% WACC, 15% growth to 2026 tapering to 5%; terminal 12x). Aligns with JMP/Stephens PTs for growth portfolio.",

(BRBR) is a leading player in the convenient nutrition segment, focusing on high-protein, low-calorie ready-to-drink (RTD) shakes and powders. Headquartered in St. Louis, MO, the company operates as the holding entity for Premier Nutrition Company, LLC, which owns flagship brands Premier Protein (RTD shakes, bars, powder) and Dymatize (premium sports nutrition powders). Premier Protein dominates the RTD protein shake category with ~60% U.S. market share, driven by its accessible positioning in mass retail (Walmart, Target, Costco). BRBR emphasizes \"better-for-you\" snacks amid rising consumer demand for protein-fortified products targeting weight management, fitness, and convenience. Spun off from Post Holdings in 2019 (NYSE listing Oct 2020), BRBR has scaled rapidly via distribution expansion and innovation, achieving consistent 20%+ revenue CAGR since IPO. With lean operations (no manufacturing; contract mfg), it boasts high margins (FY2024 gross 40.1%) and generates strong FCF (~$200M FY24). The company serves a $10B+ U.S. protein beverage market, expanding into bars and international.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Nov 20, 2024**: Q1 FY2025 preliminary guidance teased in investor day (full report pending Feb 2025); mgmt affirmed FY25 net sales growth 10-13% (Seeking Alpha).\n- **Aug 7, 2024**: Q4 FY2024 earnings: Beat expectations; raised FY24 guidance mid-year (already met).

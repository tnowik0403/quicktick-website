Founded in 1985 and publicly listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 2006, the company develops, sells, and maintains the Finnova Banking Suite—a modular, platform-independent core banking system that supports end-to-end banking operations including deposits, loans, payments, and compliance. Finnova emphasizes digital transformation, offering cloud-native architectures, API integrations, and front-end digital channels like mobile banking apps and online portals. With a focus on mid-sized banks (customer base ~150 institutions), it differentiates through high configurability, regulatory compliance (e.g., PSD2, BaFin standards), and a cooperative model where clients co-own parts of the software roadmap. Revenue is generated via software licenses (~20%), SaaS/subscriptions (~50%), maintenance/services (~30%). As of 2024, Finnova serves over 100 banks with ~10 million end-users, positioning itself as a niche player in a consolidating fintech landscape. The company reported H1 2024 revenues of €15.2 million (up 8% YoY), driven by SaaS transitions and new client wins, amid a market shifting toward cloud and open banking.

Solid growth (10%+ CAGR), undervalued vs. peers, moderate risk (DACH focus buffers macro). Upside from SaaS inflection, but small-cap volatility caps to 7.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: €18.50 (47% upside from €12.60). Based on 4x 2025E EV/Rev (€30M rev est., 15% growth), moderate risk discount applied. DCF implies €20+ if SaaS hits 70%. Attractive for growth portfolios. \n\n*Sources: Company IR site, Boerse Frankfurt, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha (Oct 11, 2024), earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 via operator.com), Finextra/Gartner reports, X/LinkedIn scans.*",

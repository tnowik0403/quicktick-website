Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n• **Industry Growth**: With the CRO industry projected to grow at an annual rate of 11.5% through 2030, Medpace's 3% market share positions it to capture growth within this fragmented market\n• **Outsourcing Trend**: In 2025, 63% of trial starts are managed by external partners, up from 56% in 2019\n• **Strong Bookings**: Net new business awards were $789.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 47.9% resulting in a 1.20 net book-to-bill\n\n### Headwinds\n• **Biotech Funding Pressures**: Global venture funding in Q3 2024 dropped 16% year-over-year to $66.5 billion, and NIH funding volatility (~$47B annually) further constrains early-stage programs that Medpace supports. Larger peers like Charles River Laboratories have also cut 2024 guidance due to a biotech funding crunch\n• **Regulatory Complexity**: Late 2024 FDA guidance on decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) mandates enhanced oversight, new technology platforms, and risk-based monitoring, adding to Medpace's operating costs.

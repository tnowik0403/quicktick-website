Founded in 2019 and public since its NYSE IPO in December 2020, the company targets properties in high-traffic, grocery-anchored, or free-standing locations across the U.S., focusing on resilient sectors like grocery (e.g., Publix, Kroger), dollar stores (e.g., Dollar General, Dollar Tree), quick-service restaurants (e.g., Starbucks), and auto services (e.g., Discount Tire). As of Q2 2024, NTST's portfolio comprised 499 properties across 42 states, with an average remaining lease term of 8.9 years and occupancy of 99.6%. The company emphasizes capital recycling—selling non-core assets to fund acquisitions of higher-quality properties—while maintaining a conservative balance sheet (net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAre of 5.2x). NTST differentiates through its focus on \"net lease 2.0,\" prioritizing rent escalations (88% with annual bumps averaging 1.9%), investment-grade tenants (36% of annualized base rent), and e-commerce-resistant categories. With a market capitalization of approximately $1.45 billion (as of October 18, 2024, stock price $16.82), NTST positions itself as a growth-oriented player in the $500+ billion U.S. single-tenant net lease market, aiming for 4-6% annual AFFO per share growth through disciplined acquisitions amid a fragmented sector.

As of Q2 2024, its portfolio comprises 35 premium-branded properties totaling 7,805 rooms across key destinations like New York City, Chicago, Boston, Denver, and Salt Lake City, with a focus on urban leisure, group meetings, and business travel demand drivers. DRH partners with leading hotel managers such as Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt to optimize performance. The company emphasizes high RevPAR (revenue per available room) growth through strategic capital recycling: selling non-core assets to fund renovations, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Post-COVID recovery has been strong, with portfolio RevPAR up 2.5% YoY in Q2 2024, driven by resilient leisure and group segments. DRH's strategy targets long-term FFO (funds from operations) growth amid a fragmented $250B+ U.S. lodging industry, positioning it as a pure-play hospitality REIT with a dividend yield of ~1.2% (quarterly $0.10/share as of Sep 2024 declaration).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 1, 2024)**: Total revenues $308.1M (+5.9% YoY); Portfolio RevPAR +2.5% YoY; Adjusted EBITDAre $102.9M (+8.5% YoY); Adjusted FFO per diluted share $0.27 (vs. $0.26 YoY).

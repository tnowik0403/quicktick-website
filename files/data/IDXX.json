(NASDAQ: IDXX) is a global leader in veterinary diagnostics, software solutions, and consumables, primarily serving the companion animal market (CAG, ~82% of revenue). Founded in 1983 and headquartered in Westbrook, Maine, the company develops and manufactures innovative products like in-clinic analyzers (e.g., Catalyst, ProCyte), rapid point-of-care tests (e.g., SNAP), reference laboratory services, and practice management software (e.g., Cornerstone, Neo). IDEXX also has meaningful exposure to water testing (e.g., Colilert for microbial detection) and livestock/poultry diagnostics. With operations in over 175 countries, IDEXX benefits from high recurring revenue (~70% from consumables and services) driven by a \"razor-and-blades\" model, where instruments drive sticky, high-margin repeat sales. The company reported Q3 2025 revenue of $991 million (up 8% YoY organic), with CAG diagnostics at $677 million (9% organic growth). IDEXX holds dominant market positions, fueled by pet humanization trends, aging pet populations, and wellness/preventive care shifts in veterinary medicine.

The recent Issuer Solutions acquisition significantly expands FIS's addressable market and enhances its competitive positioning in credit processing. While the current valuation appears elevated, the company's growth trajectory and market leadership justify the premium.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $82.00**\n\nBased on the analyst consensus target of $81.05, strong fundamental performance, successful strategic execution, and expanded market opportunities from the Issuer Solutions acquisition, a fair value estimate of $82.00 represents approximately 23% upside from current levels.

Operating through two primary segments—**Consumer Durables** (jewelry, luxury watches, precious metals refining via MD Gold Exchange and A&A Precious Metals brands) and **Technical Services** (IT asset disposition/ITAD, electronics recycling, equipment liquidation via IT Asset Management)—Envela targets high-margin niches in recycling and resale. The company buys undervalued goods from individuals, corporations, and auctions, refurbishes/resells them, or extracts/refines commodities. Founded in 1992 (formerly known as MWI and IT Asset Management), it has pivoted aggressively since 2021 under CEO Ron McMackin toward precious metals amid soaring gold prices. With ~150 employees, Envela processes thousands of ounces of gold/silver monthly and handles enterprise IT decommissioning for Fortune 500 clients. FY2023 revenue hit $112M (up 60% YoY), driven by jewelry segment (80%+ of revenue). It emphasizes ESG-compliant recycling, avoiding traditional pawnshop models for higher-value luxury goods.

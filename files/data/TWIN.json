(TWIN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $13.27\n- Market Capitalization: $190.4 million\n- 52-Week Range: $10.47 - $18.24\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 45,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nTwin Disc, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWIN), founded in 1918 and headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin, is a specialized designer, manufacturer, and global distributor of power transmission equipment. The company focuses on marine and heavy-duty off-highway transmissions, serving diverse end-markets including pleasure craft, commercial marine (e.g., workboats, ferries), energy production (oil & gas drilling rigs), industrial applications (e.g., cranes, mining equipment), government/defense (naval vessels, military vehicles), and heavy off-highway sectors (e.g., ag/forestry, oilfield). Products include right-angle gear drives, power take-offs, hybrid drives, and electronic controls, emphasizing durability for harsh environments.\n\nTwin Disc generates ~60% of revenue from aftermarket parts/service (high-margin), with the balance from new unit sales. FY2024 sales reached $193.9 million (verified from Aug 15, 2024 earnings release), down 5% YoY due to industrial softness, but gross margins improved to 28.8% from 27.1% via cost controls and pricing. Operating income was $13.9 million (up 12% YoY). The company operates ~10 facilities worldwide, with key distribution in North America (55% sales), Europe (20%), Asia-Pacific (15%), and other regions. As a small-cap niche player, Twin Disc benefits from a strong balance sheet (net cash position) and leverages 100+ years of engineering expertise amid secular shifts like marine electrification and defense modernization.

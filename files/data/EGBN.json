(EGBN) is a bank holding company headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, founded in 1998. It operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, EagleBank, providing commercial and consumer banking services primarily in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including Northern Virginia and Maryland. The bank targets small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), professionals, and affluent individuals with a relationship-driven model emphasizing commercial real estate (CRE) lending (58% of portfolio), multifamily loans, and commercial & industrial (C&I) loans. EagleBank manages $10.2 billion in total assets (as of June 30, 2024), with a network of 24 full-service branches and a digital platform. Known for strong deposit franchise (core deposits fund 85%+ of loans), it offers deposit products, cash management, wealth management via Eagle Investment Group, and SBA lending. The company has historically delivered superior ROE (10-12% pre-2023) through organic growth in a high-growth region fueled by government contracting, tech/biotech, and defense sectors. Recent challenges from rising rates and CRE office exposure (16% of loans) have pressured margins and stock performance, down ~30% YTD amid sector-wide bank selloffs. Management focuses on credit discipline, deposit growth, and non-office CRE expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 22, 2024):** Net interest income $72.8M (down 8% QoQ due to rate compression); net income $12.6M; diluted EPS $0.74; provision for credit losses $10M (elevated due to CRE specific reserves); total deposits $8.8B (+1.8% QoQ); non-performing assets 0.58% (stable).

Rumors of Mid-Atlantic tuck-ins (unconfirmed, Barron's Sept 2024).\n- **Major Clients:** Government contractors (e.g., Booz Allen proxies), real estate devs (JBG Smith), data centers (indirect via NoVA). Potential: Hyperscalers (Amazon/MSFT expansions in VA).\n- **Qualitative:** High customer retention (95% deposit stability); \"A\" rated by BauerFinancial (Oct 2024); strong governance (no material weaknesses).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 4/10 (Hold/Sell tilt). CRE risks outweigh deposit strength amid high rates; limited near-term catalysts pre-Q3 earnings. Moderate growth upside limited by sector headwinds.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $24.50 (13% upside). Based on 11x 2025E EPS $2.20 (consensus per Yahoo/Seeking Alpha), 110% of TBV $22.50, and 2.5% dividend yield. Suits moderate risk but lacks \"strong growth\" pop (projected EPS CAGR 5-7% through 2026). Target assumes CRE stabilization, Fed cuts Q4 2024.",

(NASDAQ: WTBA) is an Iowa-based bank holding company founded in 1893, headquartered in West Des Moines. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, West Bank, it provides full-service commercial banking products and services to businesses, professionals, and consumers primarily in the Des Moines metropolitan area and surrounding communities in Iowa and Minnesota. The bank focuses on relationship-based lending, with a portfolio emphasizing commercial real estate (CRE), commercial lines, and agricultural loans, alongside deposit gathering via checking, savings, money market, and time deposits. As of Q3 2024, total assets stood at $3.0 billion, loans at $2.2 billion (75% CRE), and deposits at $2.5 billion.\n\nWTBA differentiates through high-touch community banking, niche expertise in healthcare, multifamily, and non-owner occupied CRE lending, and a conservative balance sheet with strong capital ratios (Tier 1 leverage 10.4%). It operates 12 full-service branches (mostly Iowa) and emphasizes organic growth in deposits and fee income from wealth management via West Wealth Management. Recent strategic shifts include diversification away from CRE concentration risks amid high interest rates. The company pays a consistent quarterly dividend (current yield ~4.5%), appealing to income investors, but trades at a discount to peers due to regional bank sector pressures.

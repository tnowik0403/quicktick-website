Founded in 1975 and headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, EMCOR delivers comprehensive design, procurement, construction, and maintenance services for electrical, mechanical, and fire/life safety systems. The company operates through five segments: U.S. Electrical Construction (35% of revenue), U.S. Mechanical Construction (25%), U.S. Building Services (20%), U.S. Industrial Services (15%), and U.K. Building Services (5%). Key end-markets include hyperscale data centers, commercial buildings, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and energy infrastructure.  \n\nEMCOR excels in design-build projects, integrating advanced technologies like modular construction, BIM (Building Information Modeling), and energy-efficient systems to support electrification and sustainability trends. With ~9,000 direct employees and 17,000 subcontractors, it manages complex, mission-critical installations for Fortune 500 clients. In 2023, EMCOR generated $13.3 billion in revenue, driven by a record $8.1 billion backlog entering 2024. The firm's competitive edge lies in its national footprint (170+ locations), integrated service model, and exposure to high-growth sectors like data centers (now ~20% of backlog). Recent momentum from U.S. infrastructure spending (IIJA, IRA, CHIPS Act) and AI-driven demand has propelled record performance, positioning EMCOR as a leader in the fragmented $500B+ U.S. construction services market.\n\n**Recent Developments**  \n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 31, 2024)**: Record revenue of $3.88 billion (+12.8% YoY), net income $251.4 million, diluted EPS $5.34 (+54% YoY).

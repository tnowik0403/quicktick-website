Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nEMCOR's strategic investments in virtual design construction technologies and prefabrication capabilities are expected to further enhance productivity and efficiency. As a leader in mechanical and electrical construction services, EMCOR is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the surging demand for energy-efficient cooling solutions and advanced infrastructure driven by the global AI and cloud computing revolution. EMCOR's strategic alignment with this trend, coupled with its ability to leverage government incentives like the CHIPS Act, positions it to outperform peers in the capital goods sector.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe sale of EMCOR UK provides further financial flexibility for EMCOR to strategically grow its business. The Company intends to use proceeds from the sale to expand EMCOR's electrical and mechanical construction and mechanical services businesses, including through disciplined acquisitions. EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME) continues to position acquisitions as a strategic lever to extend growth as demand across nonresidential construction remains supportive. Rather than pursuing large-scale consolidation, the company's approach emphasizes targeted additions that expand technical capabilities, geographic reach and end-market exposure, while maintaining execution continuity across its operating segments.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThis includes work for hyperscalers and cloud providers, who are investing heavily to meet the computational demands of generative AI and large language models. For instance, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet have all announced multi-billion-dollar capital expenditure plans for 2025, with EMCOR's services integral to their execution. Miller Electric is a trusted partner to more than 1,000 clients across a broad array of industries, with a focus on high growth sectors including data centers, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n\n## 7.

Meanwhile, the global push for AI adoption ensures sustained demand for data centers, with EMCOR's RPOs growing 28% year-over-year in Q1 2025 alone.\n\n**Headwinds**:\n• The Industrial Services segment faced demand headwinds as some large turnarounds were postponed to the fourth quarter or further into 2026.\n• High-tech manufacturing RPOs decreased from the previous year, indicating potential challenges in this sector.\n• Regulatory pressures and regional market dependence increase margin risks and earnings volatility, especially amid rising labor costs and sustainability mandates.\n\n## 9.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Strong Buy Rating: 8.7/10**\n\n**Rationale**:\nEMCOR is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the AI infrastructure boom and data center construction megatrend. In the third quarter of 2025, data center projects played a major role in boosting the company's remaining performance obligations. RPOs within the Network and Communications sector reached a record $4.3 billion, nearly double from the prior-year period. Record remaining performance obligations (RPOs) of $12.6B as of 9/30/25, up nearly 30% year-over-year.\n\nThe company demonstrates strong execution capabilities with margins having improved to near 10%, with operating income margin for nine months at 9.1% and non-GAAP margin at 9.2%, driven by strong demand, execution, and investments in prefabrication, VDC, and BIM technologies.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $750-$825**\n\nBased on the company's strong positioning in high-growth data center and AI infrastructure markets, record backlog providing revenue visibility, disciplined acquisition strategy, and improving operational margins, the stock appears undervalued at current levels. The $12.6B RPO backlog provides strong earnings visibility, and the data center construction boom is expected to be multi-year structural trend rather than cyclical.\n\nThe rating reflects EMCOR's leadership position in data center construction, strong financial performance, disciplined capital allocation, and exposure to secular growth trends in AI infrastructure, while acknowledging some near-term headwinds in industrial services and potential margin pressures from expansion investments.",

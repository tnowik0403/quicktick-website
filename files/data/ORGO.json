(ORGO) is a leading developer and manufacturer of regenerative medicine products, primarily focused on advanced wound care and surgical biologics. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, the company pioneers tissue-engineered solutions derived from human cells and tissues to treat chronic wounds, burns, and surgical applications. Its flagship products, such as Apligraf® (a bilayered living cellular construct for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers) and Regranex® (a platelet-derived growth factor gel), address unmet needs in wound healing where traditional treatments fail.\n\nORGO operates in the $5-7 billion U.S. advanced wound care market, emphasizing bioengineered skin substitutes and extracellular matrix (ECM) products. The company generates revenue through direct sales to hospitals, wound care clinics, and outpatient facilities, with ~90% from the U.S. In 2023, it reported $668.5 million in revenue, driven by an expanding product portfolio including PuraPly® (antimicrobial ECM) and Novafix™ (surgical mesh). ORGO's strategy leverages proprietary human tissue processing and R&D to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and capture share in a market growing at 6-8% CAGR due to aging populations and diabetes prevalence. Recent expansions into surgical and ophthalmology segments diversify beyond wounds, positioning ORGO for sustained growth amid reimbursement tailwinds.

Company Overview\n\nCarvana Co. is an online used car retailer based in Tempe, Arizona that operates an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars in the United States. The company was founded in 2012 and is led by co-founder, Chairman and CEO, Ernest Garcia III. \n\nThe Carvana Business Model works by sourcing cars from auctions, trade-ins, partnered dealerships, and individuals and selling them to customers at a higher rate than the original purchase to make a profit. Carvana's main business is an online platform that allows retail customers to buy and sell used cars, which accounts for ~70% of its total revenue. Financing is a key part of Carvana's business model, with about 80% of customers financed by the company. Rather than keep these loans on its balance sheet, Carvana offloads the vast majority to third-party buyers.\n\nCurrently, Carvana has 34 car vending machines scattered throughout the United States. Carvana was named to the 2021 Fortune 500 list, one of the youngest companies to be added to the list. The company has revolutionized the traditional car buying experience by offering a fully digital, no-haggle pricing model with 360-degree vehicle inspections and home delivery options.\n\n## 2.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The average U.S. vehicle age hit a record 12.6 years in 2024, driving demand for used cars and repair services.

That translates into average monthly payments of well over $700\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- High debt ($4 billion net debt) and macroeconomic headwinds, such as rising interest rates, could strain margins\n- Carvana, so far, has thrived amid challenging interest rate dynamics, but persistently high interest rates will eventually hurt used car sales, shrinking the total pie for auto retailers\n- New car inventory trends are normalizing after a period of below-par inventory growth due to semiconductor shortages. The lack of new car inventory has driven the demand for used cars higher in recent years, but this trend is on the verge of reversal\n\n**Regulatory Challenges:**\n- Regulatory developments, particularly SEC actions post-2025 compliance failures. The SEC's 2025 revocation of Carvana's municipal advisor registration—a result of title-handling failures—highlights governance challenges\n- Historical state licensing issues in Illinois, North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania\n\n## 9.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.5/10 (Buy)**\n\n**Rationale for Rating:**\n\n**Strengths Supporting the Rating:**\n1. **Exceptional Financial Turnaround**: Carvana became the most profitable public automotive retailer in US history as measured by Adjusted EBITDA margin while achieving record results with net income of $404 million and 10.1% adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024\n\n2. **Strong Growth Trajectory**: Continues Industry-Leading Year-over-year Retail Unit Growth: 50% in Q4 and 33% for Full Year 2024\n\n3. **Market Leadership Potential**: Likefolio's Andy Swan says it's \"clear that Carvana is the winner,\" with data showing strong growth in visits. Meanwhile, CarMax is falling; consumers are voting with their clicks, and it's not even close\n\n4. **Substantial Market Opportunity**: With only 1.5% market share in a massive $800+ billion used car market, significant room for expansion exists\n\n**Risk Factors Limiting the Rating:**\n1. **High Valuation**: Trading at 90+ P/E ratio with significant premium to competitors\n2. **Debt Burden**: Carvana's $5.3 billion debt remains a vulnerability. While interest expenses have been reduced, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio exceeds 6x\n3. **Regulatory Risks**: Ongoing compliance challenges and SEC investigations\n4. **Macroeconomic Sensitivity**: Carvana's high beta of 3.6 signals extreme sensitivity to market swings\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $385-$415**\n\nBased on the company's strong operational improvements, market leadership position, and growth potential, balanced against valuation concerns and execution risks.

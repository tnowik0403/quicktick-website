(NYSE: CVNA) is a pioneering e-commerce platform transforming the used vehicle retail industry through a seamless, technology-driven buying and selling experience. Founded in 2012 by Ernie Garcia III and headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, Carvana operates as a fully online marketplace, eliminating traditional dealership hassles with features like 360° vehicle imaging, 7-day/400-mile money-back guarantees, 150-point inspections, and signature \"car vending machines\" for delivery. The company sources inventory via trade-ins, auctions, and partnerships, selling directly to consumers across 30+ U.S. markets with ~28,000 vehicles typically in stock.\n\nCarvana's vertically integrated model includes proprietary logistics (via ADESA auctions integration post-2024 merger), reconditioning centers, and financing options through its Carvana Capital subsidiary. It targets millennials and Gen Z with a mobile-first app, achieving ~14% YoY retail unit sales growth in Q2 2024. From near-bankruptcy in 2022-2023 amid high debt and market downturns, Carvana executed a dramatic turnaround via $5.5B debt restructuring (Oct 2023), Ally Bank financing ($2.2B facility, Sep 2024), and cost cuts, posting its first profitable quarter in Q2 2024.

Risks: Recession could cap at flat.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (TTM Q2 2024) | CVNA | CarMax (KMX) | Group 1 (GPI) | CarGurus (CARG) |\n|----------------------|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Retail Units (Q2 '24)** | 97k | 184k | 88k (new+used) | N/A (leads) |\n| **Revenue** | $11.0B | $26.5B | $18.1B | $0.68B |\n| **Gross Margin** | 15.3% | 11.2% | 19.5% | 87% (ads) |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 11% | 4.5% | 7.2% | 25% |\n| **Market Cap** | $35.8B | $12.5B | $5.2B | $2.1B |\n| **EV/Sales** | 3.2x | 0.5x | 0.3x | 3.5x |\n| **YTD Return** | +250% | -20% | +10% | +30% |\n\n*Sources: Company filings, Yahoo Finance.

No major new deals announced.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Retail consumers (avg FICO 740); Ally (financing); dealers via wholesale (~20k cars/month post-ADESA).\n- **Potential**: Enterprise fleets (piloting EV bulk); insurers for total-loss vehicles; international expansion (Europe scouting, 2026+).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Chip Perry (ex-CarMax) since 2020; strong turnaround execution.\n- **ESG**: Improving (EV focus); but high emissions from logistics.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish (avg analyst PT $201, 15 Buys/3 Holds; Needham \"Buy\" Oct 2024). Risks: Meme-stock volatility, regulatory (CFPB auto finance scrutiny).\n- **Moat**: Tech (AI pricing), brand loyalty (NPS 85), network effects in sourcing.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth portfolios). Exceptional turnaround momentum, 20%+ unit growth, profitability scale outweigh risks in recovering used car cycle. Hold short-term volatility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $225 (28% upside). DCF-based (20% CAGR revenue to 2028, 15% WACC, terminal 8% growth); aligns with 4x 2025 EV/Sales vs. peers. Moderate risk: Debt maturity wall 2028, macro sensitivity.",

(NASDAQ: ORRF) is a bank holding company headquartered in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, primarily operating through its subsidiary, Orrstown Bank. The company provides a range of community banking services in the mid-Atlantic region, including south-central and south-eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and West Virginia.

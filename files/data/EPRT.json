(NYSE: EPRT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of November 1, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Closing Price**: $28.45\n- **Market Capitalization**: $4.91 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $22.65 - $30.19\n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.7% (annualized $1.06/share; quarterly dividend of $0.285/share declared Oct 29, 2024)\n- **P/FFO Multiple**: ~14.5x (trailing)\n\n## Company Overview\nEssential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. (EPRT) is an internally managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in single-tenant, net lease properties leased primarily to service-oriented, recession-resistant businesses. Founded in 2016 and publicly listed in 2018, EPRT owns approximately 1,936 properties across 15 states in the U.S., totaling 57.3 million square feet as of Q3 2024. Its portfolio is 100% leased under long-term triple-net leases (average remaining term ~14.5 years), with rents escalated annually (average 1.9% bumps). Tenants operate in high-growth, e-commerce-resistant sectors like car washes (e.g., Tommy's Express, ZIPS), quick-service restaurants (e.g., 7 Brew, Dutch Bros), medical services (e.g., Aspen Dental), early childhood education (e.g., The Learning Experience), and auto services (e.g., Take 5 Oil Change). This focus delivers stable cash flows, with ~98% rent collection rate historically. EPRT's strategy emphasizes opportunistic acquisitions via sale-leasebacks and portfolio purchases from operators seeking capital for growth, targeting properties with unit-level financials showing strong cash flow coverage (average 2.5x rent coverage). The company maintains a conservative balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~5.3x; 89% fixed-rate debt; no debt maturities until 2026) and has grown its portfolio from 530 properties at IPO to nearly 2,000 today, achieving compounded AFFO growth of ~10% annually. EPRT differentiates via its \"investor-first\" culture, active asset management (e.g., lease restructurings yielding 10-20% rent increases), and focus on middle-market operators underserved by larger peers.

Decline risk if rates stay high (5% downside).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (as of Nov 1, 2024) | EPRT     | Realty Income (O) | NNN REIT | Pine Island (PINE) |\n|----------------------------|----------|-------------------|----------|--------------------|\n| Market Cap                | $4.91B  | $52.3B           | $8.2B   | $0.32B            |\n| Dividend Yield            | 3.7%    | 5.1%             | 5.0%    | 10.2%             |\n| Portfolio Size (# Props)  | 1,936   | 15,450           | 3,500   | 138               |\n| Avg Lease Term (Yrs)      | 14.5    | 9.0              | 10.5    | 18.0              |\n| AFFO Growth (TTM)         | +9%     | +4%              | +3%     | +15%              |\n| Debt/EBITDA               | 5.3x    | 5.8x             | 5.5x    | 4.8x              |\n| Focus                     | Service/Mid-Mkt | Diversified     | Retail  | Industrial        |\n\n*Sources: Company filings, Yahoo Finance.

Potential: Jersey Mike's, pickleball operators (LOIs Q4 2024).\n\n## Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: 95% energy-efficient properties; no major controversies.\n- **Management**: CEO Peter Mavoides (ex-Guggenheim); aligned incentives (35% insider ownership).\n- **Risks**: Cyclical exposure to consumer spending; liquidity for acquisitions.\n- **Upside Catalysts**: Rate cuts boost cap rates; NAV accretion from buys.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside; Hold if risk-averse). Rationale: 10%+ AFFO CAGR, 7%+ yield + appreciation potential; undervalued vs. peers (15% upside to NAV ~$32). Moderate risk via fixed debt, quality tenants.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $33.50 (18% upside from $28.45). Based on 16x 2025 AFFO ($2.15/share, per Q3 guidance + growth); DCF at 7.5% cap rate/9% discount. Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15%+ IRR over 2 years. \n\n*Report based on real-time searches: Google News, Seeking Alpha, EPRT IR site, Yahoo Finance, BamSEC transcripts (all accessed Nov 1, 2024).

Constellation serves a wide customer base, including utilities, large commercial and industrial clients (e.g., data centers), and residential customers via retail energy services. Formed in 2022 as a spin-off from Exelon Corporation, it focuses on decarbonization, reliability, and meeting surging demand from electrification and AI-driven data centers. With a strong emphasis on nuclear uprates and restarts, Constellation positions itself as a key enabler of the clean energy transition, benefiting from federal incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and bipartisan nuclear support. The company reported serving over 2 million customers in 2023, with nuclear providing ~90% of its generation.

Shares surged ~10% post-announcement.\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings - Adjusted operating earnings of $2.34/share (beat estimates of $1.69/share); revenue $6.52B (vs. $5.69B expected). Nuclear fleet uptime at 94.4%. Raised full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $7.60-$8.30 from $7.40-$7.80.\n- **July 2024**: Secured long-term contracts with Meta for 1.1 GW of nuclear and clean energy capacity.\n- **June 2024**: Illinois approved license extension for Clinton Clean Energy Center to 2036; uprate approved adding 50 MW.\n- **October 2, 2024**: Announced $1.8B investment in Clinton plant life extension.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Restart dormant nuclear plants (e.g., TMI-1, Clinton) to add ~1.7 GW by 2028.\n- Nuclear uprates and license extensions across fleet to boost output by 1 GW+.\n- Expand clean energy supply for hyperscale data centers amid AI boom.\n- Leverage IRA tax credits (e.g., PTC for nuclear) and DOE loans for repowering.\n- Retail growth via acquisitions and customer wins in deregulated markets.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Surging data center demand (Microsoft, Meta deals); high nuclear margins (~90% capacity factor); strong balance sheet (BBB credit rating). | High capex for restarts ($1.6B+ for TMI-1); regulatory delays (NRC approvals). |\n| **Sector-Wide** | AI/electrification driving 15-20% annual U.S. power demand growth (EIA forecast); nuclear renaissance (IRA credits, ADVANCE Act signed July 9, 2024). | Supply chain uranium shortages; competition from cheaper gas/solar; interest rate sensitivity on debt. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Nuclear Generation**: ~23 GW baseload carbon-free power (90% of output).\n- **Renewables**: 3 GW wind/solar/hydro.\n- **Retail Energy**: Electricity/natural gas to 2M+ residential/commercial customers.\n- **Capacity & Ancillary Services**: Reliability products for PJM/ISO grids.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **TMI-1 Restart**: 835 MW online by 2028 (Microsoft PPA).\n- **Clinton Repower**: 1 GW+ by 2027-2028 ($1.8B invested).\n- **Nuclear Fuel Fabrication**: Developing HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium) capabilities.\n- **Data Center PPAs**: Negotiating 5-10 GW additional supply (CEO comments, Q2 call).\n\n## Market Share\n- **U.S. Nuclear Generation**: ~20% (largest operator; EIA data, 2023: 32 GW capacity vs. total U.S. ~94 GW).\n- **Carbon-Free Power**: ~10% of U.S. total (per company filings).\n- **PJM Market (key region)**: 25-30% nuclear share.\n\n**Forecast**: Market share growth to 22-25% nuclear by 2028 (via restarts/uprates), driven by peers' retirements (e.g., 5 GW U.S. nuclear at risk per EIA). Overall clean energy share stable-to-growing amid 4-6% annual sector expansion.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Company (Ticker) | Market Cap | Nuclear Capacity (GW) | 2024 YTD Return | Key Differentiator |\n|------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Constellation (EG)** | $84.6B | 23 | +120% | Largest fleet; data center focus |\n| Vistra (VST) | $52.3B | 6.4 (post-Calpine) | +200% | Gas-heavy; retail scale |\n| NextEra (NEE) | $168B | 0 (renewables focus) | +35% | Solar/wind leader |\n| Talen Energy (TLN) | $10.2B | 2.2 | +150% | Nuclear + data centers (Amazon deal) |\n\nEG leads in nuclear scale, with superior margins but higher valuation (EV/EBITDA ~15x vs. peers 10-12x).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Microsoft (TMI PPA, Sept 2024); Meta (1.1 GW, July 2024); AWS/Amazon (via grid); Cumulative Utilities (nuclear tech).\n- **M&A**: No major 2024 deals; past includes 2023 retail bolt-ons. Watching for uranium miners.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Microsoft, Meta, ~20% revenue from top hyperscalers/utilities (Q2 call).\n- **Potential Clients**: Google, Amazon expansions; 45 GW U.S. data center pipeline (McKinsey, 2024).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG Leadership**: Zero-carbon focus aligns with net-zero pledges; S&P Global #1 Utilities ESG score.\n- **Management**: CEO Joseph Dominguez praised for deal-making (e.g., TMI revival).\n- **Risks**: Uranium price volatility (spot $80/lb, up 50% YTD); political (election-year nuclear policy).\n- **Catalysts**: Q3 earnings Nov 2024; more hyperscaler PPAs; DOE loan awards.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 9/10 (Strong Buy) – Exceptional growth from AI/data center tailwinds, nuclear moat, and contract backlog outweigh capex risks. Outperforms peers on clean energy purity.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $350/share (30% upside from $267.60) – Based on 12x 2026 EV/EBITDA ($8.50 EPS forecast), DCF with 15% demand growth, and peer multiples. Suited for growth portfolios (moderate risk via contracted revenues ~70%). Hold if risk-averse on rates.",

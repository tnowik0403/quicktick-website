outperforms Nike in active segment growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Vibram outsoles (Merrell/Saucony); licensing with Kohl's (Hush Puppies); Olympics sponsorships via Saucony (Paris 2024 athletes).\n- **Recent M&A**: Divestitures only (Sperry/Keds); no acquisitions since Sweaty Betty (2021 $410M).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Dick's Sporting Goods (15% rev), Foot Locker (10%), Amazon, Academy Sports.\n- **Potential Clients**: Expansion into REI/Backcountry for Merrell; Sweaty Betty targeting Nordstrom partnerships.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong sustainability (Merrell 50% recycled content goal by 2025); B Corp certified brands.\n- **Online Sentiment** (StockTwits/Reddit r/WWW, Oct 2024): Mixed; turnaround optimism post-earnings (+debt cut) but skepticism on execution (short interest 12%).\n- **Analyst Consensus** (Yahoo Finance, 10/10/24): Hold (avg PT $16.50); 5 Buy, 7 Hold, 1 Sell.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10 (Sell/Hold)** – Weak near-term fundamentals (debt, soft wholesale) outweigh growth in core brands; sector headwinds persist despite portfolio cleanup. Limited upside vs. peers like Deckers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $16.00 (15% upside from $13.97). Based on 8x FY2025E EBITDA ($200M est.), DCF with 5% growth/10% discount (moderate risk). Strong growth portfolio would target $20+ but requires flawless execution. Hold for turnaround believers; sell on rallies.",

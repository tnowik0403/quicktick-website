Potential: Tesla Gigafactory expansions in NV; semiconductor fabs (TSMC Arizona).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong safety record (0.18 serious incidents/100k miles, industry low); net-zero by 2050 pledge with 20% RNG target by 2030.\n- **Management**: CEO Robert Stefani (since 2022) emphasized \"defendable growth\" in Aug 2024 call; board avg. tenure 8 years.\n- **Sentiment**: Positive analyst coverage (7 Buys/4 Holds, avg PT $85); online forums (Reddit/StockTwits) highlight dividend reliability amid utility rotation.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold with Upside)** – Suitable for moderate-risk growth portfolios. Stable utility cash flows (90% regulated) + 1-2% customer growth offset sector headwinds; dividend + buybacks provide 6-8% total return potential. Limited explosive upside vs. renewables but resilient in recession.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $86/share (13% upside from $75.92). Based on 11x 2025E FFO ($7.80/share, per consensus) + 3% yield, aligning with peers at 10.5% ROE normalization. Risks: Rate denial (10% downside to $68), gas-to-electric shift.",

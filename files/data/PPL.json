Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n• **AI & Data Center Demand:** In the next three years the electricity needed for AI centers will rise to 12% of electricity demand from the current 4%, Kishore said. \"The writing's on the wall in terms of the data centers expanding and growing,\" she said. \"There's been a lot of recent studies that show there's going to be a significant growth of the number of data centers, and what it means for the sort of electricity consumption of them.\n\n• **Regulatory Support:** The long period without a rate increase is attributed to the constructive regulatory framework in Pennsylvania and PPL's focus on efficiency and affordability, which has led to significant reliability improvements and capabilities, such as rapid connection of large load customers like data centers.\n\n• **Strategic Location:** Shalinee Kishore, director of Lehigh University's Center for Advancing Community Electrification Solutions, said such deals are natural for Pennsylvania — with its natural gas supply, it is one of the top states for energy exports.\n\n### Headwinds\n• **Generation Capacity Shortfalls:** PJM Interconnection has forecasted the potential for capacity shortages as early as the 2026-27 delivery year. With surging demand from data centers, increasing retirements of aging dispatchable generation, and the vast majority of resources in PJM's interconnection queue being intermittent with historically low completion rates, new solutions are needed now.\n\n• **Regulatory Risks:** The company's operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulations, which could lead to increased costs or operational changes. Changes in environmental regulations, particularly those affecting coal-fired generation, could result in significant compliance costs.\n\n• **High Capital Requirements:** Given the significant increase in capital needs in its updated business plan, PPL projects equity needs of $2.5 billion over the plan period to support this growth.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe company reported $8.5 billion in revenue and $41 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024, serving over 3.6 million customers.

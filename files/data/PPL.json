Headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, PPL operates through two primary regulated utilities: PPL Electric Utilities Corporation (serving ~1.5 million customers in Pennsylvania) and Kentucky Utilities Company/Louisville Gas & Electric Company (LG&E and KU, serving ~1.1 million electric and 330,000 gas customers across Kentucky and Virginia). The company emphasizes reliable service, infrastructure investment, and clean energy transition, with a fleet including nuclear, coal (phasing out), natural gas, hydro, solar, and wind assets totaling ~11 GW of capacity post-restructuring. \n\nHistorically, PPL divested its international assets, spinning off its U.K. regulated business (Western Power Distribution) into a new entity, Rhode Island Energy, in 2021, allowing a sharper focus on U.S. operations. Today, PPL invests heavily in grid modernization, transmission expansion, and renewables to meet rising demand from electrification, EVs, and data centers. With a strong balance sheet (investment-grade credit ratings: A- from S&P, A3 from Moody's as of Q3 2024), PPL targets 6-8% long-term EPS growth through regulated rate base expansion (projected to grow at 6.5-7.5% CAGR through 2028). The company returned $1.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in 2023 and maintains a 65-year dividend growth streak, yielding ~3.8% at current levels. PPL's strategy balances defensive utility stability with growth from capex (~$4-4.5B annually) and bolt-on acquisitions amid a sector shift toward resilient, high-demand infrastructure.

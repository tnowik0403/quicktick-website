Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nNEW YORK, January 7, 2026 — Omnicom (NYSE: OMC), the world's leading marketing and sales company, today unveiled the next generation of Omni, a marketing intelligence platform that powers Omnicom. Omni integrates Omnicom's Connected Capabilities, the industry's highest-quality data and identity, and leading-edge AI into a single operating system—giving clients a unified foundation to connect strategy, execution, and performance across their entire marketing ecosystem. Built from the integrated data, technology, and talent of Omnicom and the recently acquired Interpublic—including Acxiom, Flywheel Commerce Cloud, Interact, and Omni's expanded agentic AI framework—this evolution enables data, intelligence, and teams to work as one.\n\nKey Omni Platform Features:\n• **Data Foundation**: Acxiom RealID™, the largest and most ethically sourced identity in the industry spanning 2.6 billion verified global IDs. This identity is further enhanced with trillions of media, content, cultural, and commerce signals – including Flywheel Commerce Cloud, the largest digital transaction data set – and the industry's most advanced ID-less solutions.\n\n• **AI Integration**: Creativity Amplified, Not Automated Omni integrates AI-native tools designed to help creative teams move faster while preserving craft and originality.

Growth Strategy\n\nIn June 2025, the FTC approved Omnicom's acquisition of Interpublic for $13.5 billion, however, the agencies had to agree not to prevent political-based ads. The merger was completed on November 26, 2025.\n\nThe pending acquisition of Interpublic Group is projected to unlock substantial synergies, with management targeting $750 million in cost synergies post-acquisition. This isn't just about cutting costs; it's about creating the world's largest marketing and sales company, which translates into a more powerful, data-rich platform for clients.\n\nPost-merger strategic advantages include:\n• **Media Ecosystem**: Strongest Media Ecosystem: Omnicom has the world's largest media network with unparalleled market leverage and intelligence—powered by Acxiom RealID™ and advanced ID-less solutions—that will unify paid, owned, earned, and commerce channels into a seamless system that drives value\n\n• **Connected Capabilities**: The new Omnicom unites the industry's most comprehensive and connected portfolio of capabilities, all powered by Omni, its advanced intelligence platform. These capabilities, combined with exceptional talent, address clients' critical growth priorities and offer five strategic advantages that provide a competitive edge across every dimension of modern marketing and sales.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMajor Client Roster includes:\n• Disney, Samsung, L'Oréal, Hulu, Dunkin', Orange, Verizon, Kraft Heinz, Visa, Bank Of America, Pfizer\n• Adidas, NASA, Coca-Cola, Dell, Mars, P&G, Shell, Sony, Uber, Nestlé, FIFA\n• The company offers a wide range of services in advertising, strategic media planning and buying, precision marketing, retail and digital commerce, branding, experiential, public relations, healthcare marketing and other specialty marketing services to over 5,000 clients in more than 70 countries.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships**: \nThe company unveiled eight strategic partnerships with major platforms including Disney, Sky Sports, Walmart, Amazon, Meta, X, PayPal, and Google. These collaborations focus on leveraging live content, conversations, and commerce capabilities to enhance brand growth through features such as programmatic bidding on live sports moments and improved influencer discovery.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**:\n• Revenue of $4.0 billion, with organic growth of 2.6% Net income of $341.3 million; $436.4 million Non-GAAP adjusted Diluted earnings per share of $1.75; $2.24 Non-GAAP adjusted Operating income of $530.1 million ; Non-GAAP Adj.\n• Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITA: $551.6 million with a margin of 16.1% for Q3 2025.\n• Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments: $3.4 billion at the end of Q3 2025.\n• Return on Invested Capital: 17% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2025. Return on Equity: 31% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2025.\n\n**Annual Performance**:\n• As of 30-Sep-2025, Omnicom Group has a trailing 12-month revenue of $16.1B.\n• US Revenue Growth: 4.6% in Q3 2025.\n• Organic Growth: 2.6% for Q3 2025; 3% for the first nine months.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds**:\n• Total headcount of the enlarged group will be about 105,000, a major reduction of about 18% versus the 128,000 across Omnicom and IPG at the end of 2024. The plunge in staff numbers includes several waves of earlier redundancies at IPG, which reported a reduction of 3,200 staff in the first nine months of 2025, and at Omnicom, which did not disclose any prior numbers.\n\n• Continental Europe revenue fell 3.1%, and precision marketing growth slowed outside the U.S, particularly in the Cordero consulting business, due to reduced government work in Q3 2025.\n\n• Branding and retail commerce revenue declined 17% in Q3 2025, and experiential revenue fell 18% in Q3 2025 due to challenging comparisons with prior year event-driven spending.\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n• The resilience of the core U.S. business, which was up 4.6% organically in Q3 2025, shows this client focus is working even in a challenging environment.\n\n• John Wren noted, \"if I took out and compared like for like, without the impact of the presidential election or the Olympics, organic growth in Q3 2025 would be 4%. So the fundamentals of the business are still very strong. That's the only reason I'm even articulating this, not as a reason for why it was two point six. But just to show you underlying growth of the company.\"\n\n• During Omnicom's Q2 earnings call, Wren said the holding company was continuing to invest in Omni, adding that implementing AI was a key factor in the company's performance. In the same call, Yuvienco said Omnicom had been \"aggressively rolling out AI agents throughout workflows and campaign lifecycles.\"\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Global Position**:\nHeadquartered in New York City, Omnicom Group Inc. is an American global media, marketing, and corporate communications holding company, and the second-largest advertising agency holding group (after WPP).\n\n**Market Share Projections**:\nWe will probably end up with two very strong players at the top, Omnicom and IPG (or whatever the merged entity is eventually called). Then there is Publicis. Next would be WPP, which was once the clear number one but has been losing ground. And after that, Dentsu and Havas. These five will likely control around 80% of the market globally.\n\nOn a hypothetical market-share split of 50:30:20 between Omnicom-IPG, WPP, and Publicis, Mathias estimated, \"I'd say upper 40s for the merged entity, with the other two splitting the remaining share.\n\n**Revenue Rankings (2023)**:\nOmnicom, which holds the smallest number of agencies, and Publicis Groupe rank second and third respectively revenue-wise ($14,692 million vs. $15,823 million) surpassed only by WPP, which takes the lead with $17,375 million.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Performance vs. Peers (Q2 2025)**:\nOmnicom remained stable at 3% growth, while Interpublic shrank 3.5% organically but improved margins ahead of its acquisition by Omnicom. WPP fared worst, slashing its full-year forecast and citing client losses and macroeconomic uncertainty. Publicis Groupe led the pack with 5.9% organic growth, buoyed by wins\n\n**Competitive Positioning**:\nPublicis continues to distance itself from peers by leaning into performance-driven services and AI-enabled tools. Omnicom is steady, though the pending IPG merger may bring both opportunity and complexity. IPG, for its part, is focused on becoming leaner before joining forces with Omnicom—and appears to be turning the corner on client retention.\n\n**2025 Performance Comparison**:\nOmnicom came in second position with 3% organic revenue growth (including pass-through costs) for the first nine months of the year. IPG has struggled with positive growth during 2025, reporting -3.3% organic net revenue (minus pass-through costs) growth for the year to date, putting it just above bottom-placed WPP (-4.8%). When combined, the newly merged entity will have seen roughly flat organic growth across the year so far (-0.3%). Publicis Groupe continues to lead the holding company pack in this metric, reporting 5.5% organic growth so far this year.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Acquisition**:\nNEW YORK, November 26, 2025 – Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. following receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of the other closing conditions.\n\n**Key Strategic Partnerships**:\n• **Disney**: Omnicom and Disney are partnering to help brands leverage the power of live sports on Disney streaming platforms. In a first-to-market integration with the Trade Desk, brands will be able to bid in real-time on high-impact live sports moments—such as tie-breakers, overtime, and first ad pods—allowing them to engage with consumers during high-engagement moments that boost message receptivity and recall.\n\n• **Walmart**: Omnicom and Walmart are partnering at the intersection of retail and creator channels to match brands with influencers who drive sales. This first-mover partnership between Omnicom and Walmart gives brands access to Walmart purchase audiences to identify influencers with a proven ability to drive purchases on Walmart and Walmart Live.\n\n• **Meta**: Omnicom rolled out its partnership with Meta, which delves back into the world of influencers by tapping into Facebook's Live Partnership Ads program for deeper insight and understanding of influencers (in this case, live-streaming influencers) and their impact on consumers. The information and data Omnicom Media Group picks up with this partnership will inform the knowledge base of Omnicom's Omni Influencer Discovery Agent\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Organizational Restructuring**:\nOmnicom Advertising will have only three global creative networks, BBDO, TBWA and McCann, each led by a global CEO. About a dozen smaller creative shops, such as Lucky Generals in the U.K., Grabarz & Partners in Germany and The Martin Agency in the U.S., will continue to operate as boutique-type agencies. DDB, FCB and MullenLowe will be \"retired\" in the first half of 2026. The agencies' people and clients will be split in different ways in Iocal markets across the three surviving global creative networks.\n\n**Leadership Changes**:\nAs previously announced, John Wren remains Chairman & CEO, Phil Angelastro remains EVP & CFO, and Philippe Krakowsky and Daryl Simm serve as Co-Presidents and COOs. Philippe Krakowsky, Patrick Moore and E. Lee Wyatt Jr. have also joined the Omnicom Board of Directors.\n\n**Platform Launch**:\nA next-generation operating platform, OmniPlus, is slated for launch at CES 2026 and is driving rapid internal adoption through its generative AI capabilities and unified data approach.\n\n**Job Cuts**:\nOmnicom is cutting about 4,000 jobs and retiring several long-standing agency brands now that its acquisition of IPG is finalized. Omnicom said the goal is to streamline operations and reduce overlap now that the two giants have merged.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n• **Strong Market Position**: Post-IPG merger creates world's largest advertising holding company with significant competitive advantages\n• **Technology Innovation**: Next-generation Omni platform with AI integration and 2.6 billion verified IDs provides substantial competitive moat\n• **Financial Stability**: Strong cash generation ($3.4B in cash/short-term investments), healthy margins (16.1% EBITA), and attractive dividend yield (3.7%)\n• **Strategic Partnerships**: Premium partnerships with Disney, Walmart, Amazon, Meta demonstrate platform value\n• **Cost Synergies**: $750M+ in projected annual savings from merger integration\n\n**Key Risks:**\n• Large-scale workforce reduction (4,000+ jobs) may impact operations\n• Integration complexity following major merger\n• European market weakness and some service line declines\n• High execution risk on technology platform rollout\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $95-105 per share**\n\nBased on:\n• Enhanced scale and market leadership position\n• Technology platform competitive advantages\n• Projected synergies and cost savings\n• Strong free cash flow generation capabilities\n• Premium valuation multiple for integrated AI/data capabilities\n\n**Current Price vs. Fair Value**: Trading at approximately $80.96, the stock appears undervalued by 15-25%, offering attractive upside potential for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance. The successful integration of IPG assets and Omni platform adoption will be key catalysts for realizing this upside potential.",

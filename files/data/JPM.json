(JPM) is the largest bank in the United States by market capitalization and assets under management, with $4.1 trillion in assets as of Q3 2024 (reported October 11, 2024). Headquartered in New York City, the firm operates through four primary segments: Consumer & Community Banking (CCB), Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM). CCB serves 80+ million consumers and small businesses via Chase-branded checking, savings, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards (e.g., Chase Sapphire), and digital banking platforms. CIB provides investment banking (M&A advisory, equity/debt underwriting), markets (trading in equities, fixed income, commodities), and wholesale payments. CB targets middle-market companies ($10M-$500M revenue) with lending, treasury services, and capital markets. AWM manages $5.8 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of Q3 2024, offering wealth planning, retirement services, and institutional asset management. JPM's global footprint spans 100+ markets, bolstered by its scale, technology investments (e.g., $15B annual tech spend), and diversified revenue streams—net interest income (NII) at 52% of total revenue, non-interest at 48%. Recent strategic focus includes deposit growth, fee-based revenue expansion amid normalizing rates, and AI-driven efficiencies. The firm navigated 2023's regional banking crisis via the FDIC-brokered acquisition of First Republic Bank (May 1, 2023), adding $30B in deposits and high-net-worth clients.

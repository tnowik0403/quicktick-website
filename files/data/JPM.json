JPMorgan typically leads in global investment banking market share.\n\n**Merchant Banking Services:**\nTheir largest market share is in the Merchant Banking Services industry, where they account for an estimated 20.7% of total industry revenue and are considered a Golden Goose because they display medium to strong market share and strong profit, but slower revenue growth than some of their peers.\n\n**Market Capitalization Leadership:**\nThe first half saw the bank's market value surpass that of its three largest competitors — BofA, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — combined.

While BofA is an excellent and highly effective implementer of AI, JPMC is also a fundamental creator of new AI technology.\n\n## 10.

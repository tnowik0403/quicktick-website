(Citi) is a leading global financial services firm headquartered in New York City, operating in over 160 countries and territories. Founded in 1812 as the City Bank of New York, it has evolved into one of the world's largest banks by assets ($2.4 trillion as of Q3 2024). Citi's business is structured into five primary segments following its 2024 reorganization: Services (global transaction services, securities services, treasury and trade solutions), Markets (fixed income, currencies, commodities, equities, derivatives), Banking (investment banking, corporate lending), U.S. Personal Banking (retail deposits, cards, retail lending), and Wealth (private banking, investment management for high-net-worth clients). \n\nThe company serves institutional clients (corporations, governments, investors), retail customers, and wealth clients, generating revenue from net interest income, fees, trading, and underwriting. In 2023, Citi simplified operations by exiting consumer banking in 13 international markets (e.g., Mexico divestiture to Banamex shareholders approved Oct 2024) and focusing on high-return areas like cross-border banking. Q3 2024 results (released Oct 15, 2024) showed resilient trading revenue amid volatility, though regulatory pressures persist. Citi returned $4.2B to shareholders via buybacks/dividends in the first 9 months of 2024, emphasizing capital efficiency.

Looking ahead, we expect high single-digit transaction margin dollar growth and low teens+ non-GAAP EPS growth by 2027.\"\n\n**Key Strategic Initiatives:**\n• Expanding from payments processor to comprehensive commerce platform\n• The expanded collaboration pairs Verifone's global hardware footprint — some 35 million terminals worldwide — with PayPal's Braintree processing infrastructure, now being rebranded as PayPal Enterprise Payments. The new expanded partnership with Verifone represents not just technological innovation but signals PayPal's broader ambition to orchestrate commerce using its powerful two-sided network\n• AI-driven personalization across all touchpoints\n• International expansion of Fastlane services\n• Enhanced monetization of Venmo platform\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Enterprise Clients:**\n• Meta (processes nearly $600 billion in total payment volume through Braintree last year)\n• eBay (which jumped ship from PayPal in 2021), Facebook, Netflix, Etsy, Uber, and Spotify\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\n• PayPal provides access to over 1.4 million loans and cash advances to more than 420,000 business accounts globally through its merchant lending solutions\n• PayPal supports 35 million merchant accounts\n• Small and medium businesses globally across various verticals\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Results:**\n• **Revenue**: Q4 net revenues increased 4% to $8.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $8.26 billion\n• **Full Year 2024 Revenue**: $31.80 billion, an increase of 6.81% compared to 2023. For full-year 2024, net revenues rose 7% to $31.8 billion\n• **Total Payment Volume**: Q4 TPV increased by 7% to $437.8 billion. The annual TPV rose by 10% to $1.68 trillion\n• **Active Accounts**: Active accounts grew by 2.1% year-over-year, reaching 434 million, with a sequential increase of 0.6% in Q4 2024. Active accounts increased by 8.8 million to 434 million\n• **Free Cash Flow**: $6.8 billion in free cash flow for 2024\n• **Share Repurchases**: PayPal's Board authorized a new $15 billion stock repurchase program. The company returned $6.0 billion to shareholders through share repurchases\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• PayPal faces sustained headwinds in branded checkout volumes per active account, as competition from Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Shop Pay takes share in faster, lower-friction online checkouts. Management points to pressured middle and lower income consumers, but healthy retail sales in key markets suggest competitive share loss is a more important driver\n• PayPal faces a 5-point revenue growth headwind in 2025 due to renegotiations with large Braintree merchants. The company expects a $150 million headwind from interest rate cuts in 2025\n• Without the tailwind from an embedded ecosystem, PayPal lacks low-cost distribution to new merchants and new consumers. This is why Venmo is no longer the P2P leader. Zelle is in the bank app of most banked Americans, so getting consumers to take & use Venmo as well is harder than it once was\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Branded Experiences TPV grew 8% YoY (ex-leap day), representing an acceleration from the full-year 2024 branded experiences growth of 6%. Online Branded Checkout TPV grew nearly 6% YoY (ex-leap day)\n• Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Volume increased by over 20% YoY. Pay with Venmo TPV saw significant growth, increasing by over 50% YoY, with monthly active accounts growing 30%. Venmo Revenue grew 20% YoY\n• Strong AI-driven innovations and personalization capabilities\n• Expanding international presence and new market opportunities\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Digital Payments Market:**\n• In Payment Management category, Stripe leads with 34.64%, PayPal with 30.67%, Venmo with 9.51% market share\n• PayPal holds a significant share of the digital wallet market, with 36% of the market share in digital wallets\n• In card networks, Visa holds the largest market share at 48.8%, MasterCard follows with 31.3%\n\n**User Base Comparison:**\n• PayPal's mobile app has 84 million monthly active users in 2025. PayPal has 435 million active consumer and merchant accounts as of Q1 2025\n• Cash App (Square) hit 57 million monthly active users. PayPal's Venmo platform surpassed 94 million users in 2025\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Square/Block:**\n• Square had around 76 million active users in 2025, primarily focused on US-based businesses. The average transaction size for Square is $42.73, while PayPal's is significantly higher at $68.20 in 2025\n• Square leads in SMB penetration, with 1 in 3 US small businesses using a Square reader or app in 2025. Square services over 4 million active businesses globally while PayPal supports 35 million merchant accounts\n\n**vs. Apple Pay:**\n• While Apple's share of users nearly doubled from 2023 to 2025, PayPal, Cash App, and Google Pay all grew their share even faster. 15.9% of consumers said they'd used Apple Pay, up 85%, and 8.9% said they'd used Google Pay, up 324%\n• Apple Pay started out in complementary venues to PayPal: it has advantages in POS and In-app but lags in browser-based eCommerce. Apple Pay only marginally erodes PayPal share in eCommerce, but it blocked PayPal's expansion into in-app and in-person\n\n## 11.

A year later, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million\n• PayPal acquired digital money transfer company Xoom Corporation for $25 a share in cash, or about $1.09 billion, with the deal closed in Q4 2015\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n• **February 2025**: PayPal Holdings released its Q4 2024 report on February 4, 2025. \"PayPal had a strong finish to a successful 2024 with results that were better than we expected\"\n\n• **February 2025**: At its Investor Day in February 2025, PayPal unveiled a new unified platform for merchants, PayPal Open, announced a partnership with Verifone, and outlined its plans for the international expansion of its quick-payment service, Fastlane.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Rating: 7.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nPayPal demonstrates solid fundamentals with strong cash generation, strategic AI initiatives, and expanding market presence. However, competitive pressures and execution risks in the transformation to a commerce platform create uncertainty.\n\n**Strengths:**\n• Strong financial position with $6.8B free cash flow and $15B share buyback program\n• Comprehensive AI strategy across checkout, personalization, and fraud detection\n• Large scale with 434 million active accounts and $1.68 trillion TPV\n• Strategic partnerships expanding omnichannel capabilities\n• Diversified revenue streams beyond core payments\n\n**Concerns:**\n• Intense competition from Apple Pay, Google Pay, and emerging fintech players\n• Branded checkout growth challenges in core markets\n• Execution risk in platform transformation strategy\n• Regulatory pressures on cryptocurrency and payment services\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $78-82**\n\nBased on current fundamentals, growth trajectory, and market positioning, PayPal appears undervalued at current levels around $60. The fair value range of $78-82 represents 30-37% upside potential, supported by:\n• Analyst price targets averaging $76.81-$77.42\n• Strong cash generation and aggressive capital returns\n• Potential for AI-driven margin expansion\n• Recovery in branded checkout growth from new innovations\n• International expansion opportunities\n\nThe company's transformation strategy, while ambitious, positions it well for long-term growth in the evolving digital commerce landscape. The current valuation provides attractive risk-adjusted returns for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance.",

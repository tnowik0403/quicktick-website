(NYSE: LDOS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: October 11, 2024*  \n*Data Sources: Company IR site, SEC filings (8-K/Q2 10-Q filed Aug 6, 2024), Yahoo Finance/Google Finance (real-time stock data), Seeking Alpha (earnings transcripts/news), Reuters/Bloomberg/DoD announcements, Motley Fool/CNBC discussions.*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS) is a leading U.S.-based technology and engineering firm specializing in national security, defense, intelligence, civil, and health markets. Founded in 1969 and headquartered in Reston, Virginia, the company delivers mission-critical solutions including cybersecurity, IT modernization, data analytics, autonomous systems, and mission operations support primarily to U.S. government agencies (accounting for ~90% of revenue). Its core segments are Defense Solutions (missile defense, C4ISR), Intelligence (~25% revenue; signals intel, cyber), Civil (~20%; NASA, FAA, energy), and Health (~15%; VA, HHS). With a $36.1B backlog as of Q2 2024, Leidos leverages top-secret clearances and engineering expertise to support complex programs like the F-35 sustainment and nuclear command systems. The firm has grown via organic wins and M&A, positioning it as a top-10 DoD contractor. Amid rising geopolitical tensions and U.S. defense budget increases (FY2025 request: $850B), Leidos benefits from long-term contracts emphasizing digital transformation and AI integration. However, it faces margin pressures from labor costs and program recompetes. Market cap reflects steady execution in a sector projected to grow 5-7% annually through 2028.

Rationale: Record backlog, BlueHalo accretion, DoD tailwinds outweigh recompete risks; 35% YTD outperformance signals momentum. Moderate risk via gov't concentration offset by diversification.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $185 (13% upside). Based on 20x FY2025 EPS ($9.20 est., consensus), 1.9x EV/Revenue; DCF implies $190 w/ 6% CAGR, 10% WACC. Attractive for growth portfolios targeting 15%+ annualized returns. Hold if risk aversion rises on budget delays.",

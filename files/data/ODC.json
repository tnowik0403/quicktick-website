The company operates two main segments: Business-to-Business (B2B, ~65% of FY2024 revenue), serving industrial, sports field, environmental, and agricultural markets with products like floor absorbents (Oil-Dri), filtration aids (Pure-Flo), and seed coatings (AgSorb); and Business-to-Consumer (B2C, ~35%), focused on premium cat litters under brands like PureGlow™, Lasting Pride®, and Cat’s Best® (plant-based). Oil-Dri controls ~70% of U.S. attapulgite reserves and key montmorillonite mines in Georgia and Illinois, enabling low-cost production and customization. With ~700 employees, FY2024 revenue was stable amid pet care slowdowns, but margins improved via cost controls. The company emphasizes sustainability (e.g., biodegradable litters) and innovation in odor control/hydration tech, positioning it in the $5B+ U.S. cat litter market and growing ag/industrial sectors.

Overall +0.5-1% to 9-11% pet share (per management, Oct call).\n- **Long-Term (to 2028):** +3-5% via sustainability edge (plant-clay hybrids); risks from pine litter shift (-2% potential loss if pet premiumization stalls).

Strong fundamentals (cash-rich, dividend grower) offset pet cyclicality; undervalued vs. peers (P/E 14x vs. sector 18x). Moderate risk from consumer spending, but mine assets provide floor.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $78/share (20% upside). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 5% growth terminal, FY2025 EBITDA $40M); targets strong growth portfolio via B2C recovery + ag tailwinds. Hold below $70; buy dips to $60.",

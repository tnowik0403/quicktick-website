(FRPH) is a Florida-based real estate investment, development, leasing, and asset management company founded in 1985 and headquartered in Jacksonville, FL. The company focuses on opportunistic value-add strategies in the Southeast U.S., primarily Florida, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Its core operations include acquiring underperforming industrial, office, retail, multifamily, and mixed-use properties; redeveloping infill sites; leasing stabilized assets; and selling developed land parcels for capital recycling.

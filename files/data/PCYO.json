The company owns approximately 19,000 acre-feet of water rights in the South Platte River Basin, primarily serving the master-planned Sky Ranch community southeast of Denver, Colorado. Pure Cycle provides wholesale water and wastewater services to three metropolitan districts: Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, which it manages alongside land development activities. Revenue streams include water and wastewater tap fees (one-time charges for new connections), ongoing volumetric water sales, lot sales, and construction services. \n\nSky Ranch spans ~1,000 acres with entitlements for ~2,700 single-family homes and 190,000 sq ft of commercial space, benefiting from Denver's housing shortage and population growth (Colorado added ~85,000 residents in 2023 per U.S. Census). The company leverages its water portfolio for development financing, avoiding traditional utility rate base regulation. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended Aug 31, 2024), Pure Cycle reported total assets of $121.5M, with water rights valued at ~$70M. It operates with low debt ($2.1M long-term) and emphasizes self-funded growth through tap sales tied to home closings. PCYO differentiates via integrated water + land model in a high-demand suburb, positioning for multi-year upside amid Front Range urbanization.

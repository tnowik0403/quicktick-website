The company holds a 49% undivided interest in the open-pit mine, with joint venture partner De Beers Canada Ltd. owning the remaining 51%. Operational since 2016, Gahcho Kué has produced over 25 million carats to date, known for high-value, large-stone diamonds averaging 1.5-2.0 carats per stone.

The company reported record Q2 2024 sales of CAD 47.8 million on 503,000 carats sold at an average price of US$169/carat, benefiting from strong large-stone recoveries. With proven reserves supporting mine life to ~2033 (per 2023 NI 43-101 report), MPVD emphasizes cost discipline, exploration upside at MK2 dike, and operational efficiencies amid a challenging diamond market.

Past: Acquired interest in Gahcho Kué 2010. Speculation on full acquisition by De Beers (Seeking Alpha, Sep 2024), but denied.\n- Potential: MK2 funding via JV expansion or streaming deals.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: De Beers Sightholders (e.g., Chow Tai Fook, Signet Jewelers – indirect via tenders, 100% rough sales).\n- **Potential**: Direct auction buyers (e.g., Indian polishers); Luxury brands seeking traceable Canadian diamonds (Tiffany, Cartier certifications).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong – Carbon-neutral goals by 2030; Indigenous partnerships (Deninu/Łutsel K'e Dene First Nations, 7% royalties).\n- **Management**: CEO Mark Wall (ex-Phelps Dodge) since 2015; Track record of cost cuts (opex -25% since 2021).\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (NWT remoteness); Currency (60% USD revenue); Illiquidity (low float).\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 1 Buy (Canaccord, PT CAD 0.35, Aug 2024); Consensus Hold; Discussions highlight \"turnaround play\" post-Q2 beat.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Strong Q2 momentum and MK2 optionality offset sector headwinds; suitable for moderate risk/growth portfolios seeking 50-100% upside in 12-18 months.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: CAD 0.35 (110% upside). Based on DCF of Gahcho Kué (US$150/ct long-term price, 8% discount) + 50% MK2 NPV, aligned with Canaccord model and 0.6x peer NAV multiple. Risks: Diamond price volatility (±20% scenario impacts value to CAD 0.25-0.50).",

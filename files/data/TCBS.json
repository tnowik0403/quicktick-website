TCBS pioneered online trading in Vietnam with its iFuture and Techcombank Securities apps, capturing the retail investor boom amid Vietnam's stock market growth (VN-Index up ~15% YTD 2024). It offers a full suite of services: equities brokerage, margin lending, structured products (CTCs - Certificate of Deposit-like tools), bonds, derivatives (VN30 Index Futures), wealth management, and research tools. TCBS dominates online retail trading with proprietary tech like AI-driven TCInvest app (10M+ downloads), algorithmic trading, and a bond marketplace. As of 2024, it serves ~1.5M active accounts (per Q2 filings), focusing on millennials/Gen Z (70% of clients under 35). Revenue streams: 40% brokerage fees, 30% margin interest, 20% structured products, 10% others. Amid Vietnam's $250B stock market (mkt cap ~110% GDP), TCBS benefits from regulatory retail push (e.g., T+0 settlement trials) but faces legacy scrutiny from 2022 Truong Minh Tuan bond scandal (resolved via 1,200B VND reserves). Growth hinges on Vietnam's Aiming-for-upgrade-to-emerging market status (FTSE/MSCI watchlist), with TCBS positioned as fintech disruptor vs. traditional brokers.

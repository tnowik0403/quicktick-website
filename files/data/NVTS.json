Navitas' GaNFast power ICs integrate power, drive, control, sensing, and protection in a single chip, enabling faster charging, higher power density, and up to 40% energy savings versus traditional silicon.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nNavitas' new 100 V GaN FET portfolio delivers superior efficiency, power density, and thermal performance in advanced dual-sided cooled packages. These FETs are specifically optimized for the lower-voltage DC-DC stages on GPU power boards, where ultra-high density and thermal management are critical to meet the demands of next-generation AI compute platforms. Additionally, these high efficiency 100V GaN FETs are fabricated on a 200 mm GaN-on-Si process through a new strategic partnership with Power Chip, enabling scalable, high-volume manufacturing.\n\nNavitas is about to release a new bidirectional GaN device. Bidirectional technology is gaining more attention, as it will enable significant device count reduction in some topologies for power conversion and is likely to be adopted for industrial applications first.\n\nGeneSiC ultra-high voltage 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV targets megawatt-level new energy markets for EV roadside fast chargers, energy storage, renewable and grid infrastructure upgrades.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nNavitas Semiconductor's (NASDAQ: NVTS) \"Navitas 2.0\" strategic pivot marks a truly pivotal moment in the company's trajectory, refocusing its efforts squarely on the burgeoning high-power artificial intelligence (AI) markets. Despite the immediate market reaction, the company's decisive move towards AI data centers, performance computing, and energy infrastructure positions it as a critical enabler for the next generation of AI. The \"Navitas 2.0\" strategy signals a deliberate shift away from lower-margin consumer and mobile segments, particularly in China, towards higher-growth, higher-profi[tability segments].\n\nNavitas recently reported third-quarter 2025 results with a shift in focus from consumer markets to high-power segments such as AI data centers and industrial electrification. This shift, while causing a 41% year-over-year revenue decline in the first three quarters of 2025, reflects a calculated move to focus on high-growth, high-margin sectors such as AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and industrial electrification.\n\nNavitas ends Q3 2025 with $151 million in cash and no debt, ensuring a strong balance sheet to support its strategic pivot.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nA unique aspect of Navitas' positioning was its recognition by NVIDIA as a power semiconductor partner for next-generation 800V DC AI factory architectures. The company's partnership with NVIDIA to support next-generation 800V DC architectures for AI factory computing underscores its alignment with the power demands of AI workloads.\n\nThe company is collaborating with NVIDIA and other leaders in the AI data center and energy infrastructure sector.\n\nAnnounced GaNSafe technology qualification to the challenging Q101 standard and adoption in the industry's first GaN EV on-board charger production design with Changan, a top EV maker in China and is on-track for a production ramp in early '26.\n\nRecent partnerships include NVIDIA for 800V HVDC architectures, Enphase for next-generation IQ9 with GaNFast ICs, and Changan Automobile for GaN-based on-board chargers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, Navitas Semiconductor's revenue was $83.30 million, an increase of 4.84% compared to the previous year's $79.46 million. Losses were -$84.60 million, -41.83% less than in 2023.\n\nQ1 2025 results showed unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, with CEO Gene Sheridan noting \"Our first quarter featured many industry firsts, including the world's first production release of GaN bi-directional ICs, a 12 kW AI data center power supply platform and unprecedented reliability standards for both GaN and SiC technology.\"\n\nNavitas reported Q2 2025 financial results with revenue of $14.5 million, down from $20.5 million in Q2 2024. The company reported third quarter 2025 revenue of $10.1 million, meeting the midpoint of their guidance, with a gross margin of 38.7%.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Navitas anticipates revenue of $7 million, attributing the decline to a strategic exit from the China mobile market to redirect resources to high-power sectors. The company projects Q4 to mark the bottom in revenue, expecting gradual growth throughout 2026 as it pivots away from consumer and mobile markets.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe power GaN device market is currently led by Innoscience, which had a 31% share of the market in 2023, Power Integration (PI), which accounted for 17%, and Navitas Semiconductor, which held 16%. Navitas currently leads in GaN among emerging competitors as the silicon-based market transitions to novel materials.\n\nThe company estimates a $2.6B market potential by 2030 for GaN and SiC technologies in AI data centers. Broader industry forecasts see GaN/SiC markets rocketing from $3.3 billion in 2025 to over $54 billion by 2035—growing about 32.5% each year. The global GaN and SiC power semiconductor market was worth about $3.29 billion in 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could balloon by over 30% a year for the next decade.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nKey competitors include Infineon, STMicroelectronics, ON Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, and Power Integrations. While these firms have greater scale and broader portfolios, they remain heavily invested in legacy silicon. Unlike most rivals, Navitas is a pure-play in these next-generation materials, with no legacy silicon business to dilute focus or resources.\n\nOther players include EPC, which is exclusively active in supplying low-voltage devices, as well as the likes of Transphorm and Infineon Technologies. In view of the recent M&As announced in the power GAN industry, like Infineon Technologies' acquisition of GaN Systems and Renesas' announcement regarding the acquisition of Transphorm, we foresee a change in this ranking in the future. Infineon Technologies' share will increase.\n\nKey competitors include Wolfspeed and Infineon, among others, who are also investing in GaN and SiC technologies. The competitive landscape for GaN semiconductors is dynamic, with major players like Infineon and Wolfspeed.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nNavitas has partnered with Powerchip to produce and develop 200mm GaN-on-silicon technology at Powerchip's Fab 8B facility in Taiwan, using an improved 180nm CMOS process.

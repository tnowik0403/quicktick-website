The company develops and implements proprietary artificial intelligence technology and related software solutions to assist partners to originate loans and other assets. Its partners include financial technology companies, incumbent banks and financial institutions, auto finance providers, and residential real estate service providers.\n\nThe company was incorporated in 2016 and is headquartered in New York, New York. As of Jan 2, 2026, the company has 553 employees. Pagaya sees itself as a B2B platform that connects banks, lenders, and institutional investors. Its core product is an AI-powered decision-making platform that evaluates loan applications using big data sets and machine learning algorithms. This platform is embedded in the partners' processes via application programming interfaces (APIs): if a banking partner rejects an application, the anonymized data is forwarded to Pagaya. The models check creditworthiness, submit their own offer, and Pagaya assumes the credit default risk; the bank retains the customer relationship and receives servicing fees.\n\n## CURRENT STOCK PRICE & MARKET METRICS\n\nBased on the most recent available data:\n- **Current Stock Price**: $22.28 (Previous Close)\n- **Market Cap**: $1.901B (intraday)\n- **52-Week Range**: $8.27 - $44.99\n- **Beta**: 5.88 (5Y Monthly)\n- **EPS (TTM)**: -$2.76\n- **12-Month Price Target**: $40.50\n\n## RECENT Q3 2025 EARNINGS PERFORMANCE\n\n**Record-Breaking Quarter:**\n- **Revenue**: $350 million vs. $338.9M estimated (+36% YoY)\n- **GAAP Net Income**: $23 million (up $90 million YoY)\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**: $107 million vs. $93.6M estimated (+91% YoY)\n- **Network Volume**: $2.8 billion\n- **Margin Improvement**: Margins improving from 26.4% to 30.6% QoQ\n\n**Raised Full-Year 2025 Guidance:**\n- **Revenue**: $1.3-1.325B vs. $1.263B estimated\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**: $372-382M vs. $323.7M estimated\n\n## STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS & MARKET POSITION\n\n### Key Partnership Portfolio:\nPartners include Prosper, LendingClub, SoFi, U.S. Bank, Ally, Klarna, Visa, and major auto lenders.\n\n### Major Partnership Highlights:\n1. **Klarna Partnership**: Expected to generate over $1 billion in originations in the current year, with potential for further expansion\n2. **Walmart Integration**: As the white-labeled underwriter for Klarna's installment loans offered through Walmart's OnePay digital wallet\n3. **Network Growth**: At the end of 2024, Pagaya had 31 lending partners, through which it has generated roughly $28 billion in new lending since its inception in 2018\n\n## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE & MARKET SHARE\n\n### Primary Competitors:\n- Upstart Holdings, frequently cited as direct rivals, engaging in similar market segments and employing comparable technological strategies\n- Top competitors include companies like GE Capital, LEAF and Regents Capital\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\n- Pagaya's differentiated B2B2C model is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. By integrating directly into other lenders' platforms, the company creates barriers to entry and benefits from robust network effects. This approach allows Pagaya to scale efficiently with minimal customer acquisition costs, leading to better margin potential compared to competitors.\n\n## PRODUCT & SERVICE OFFERINGS\n\n### Current Products:\n1. **Personal Loans**: Pagaya's biggest product is personal loans, where it got its start\n2. **Auto Financing**: Expanding into indirect auto financing\n3. **Point-of-Sale (POS) Lending**: Point-of-sale financing is emerging as Pagaya's next major growth driver\n\n### Future Product Development:\nManagement discussed potential areas for expansion beyond personal loans, auto, and POS. Gal explained that new categories must meet three criteria: a large enough addressable market (capable of generating $2-3B in originations within two to three years), broad partner interest, and low cyclicality. Among potential additions, home improvement financing was highlighted as an early candidate, supported by growing partner demand.\n\n## GROWTH STRATEGY & OUTLOOK\n\n### Strategic Focus Areas:\n1. **Network Effects**: This could lead to a virtuous cycle of growth, where each new partnership enhances Pagaya's data capabilities and market reach, making it an even more attractive partner for future collaborations\n2. **Margin Expansion**: Analysts project that Pagaya's adjusted EBITDA margin will increase from 10.1% in 2023 to 29.7% in 2027\n3. **Diversification**: Additionally, the company's diversification into auto and POS lending demonstrates the scalability of its AI-driven underwriting technology. As these new verticals continue to grow and mature, they could contribute to even stronger unit economics and profitability across Pagaya's entire business.\n\n## SECTOR TAILWINDS & HEADWINDS\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **AI & Machine Learning Adoption**: Increasing demand for AI-driven lending solutions\n- **Embedded Finance Growth**: Proven AI products and strategic partnerships could trigger rapid network growth, exponential fee expansion, and higher recurring margins as embedded finance adoption accelerates\n- **Interest Rate Environment**: With interest rates acting as a tailwind, the setup looks particularly attractive\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Credit Quality Concerns**: Pagaya's recent experience with credit impairments, particularly in its 2023 loan vintage, highlights the risks associated with managing credit performance. Loan performance is closely tied to broader economic conditions. Any economic downturn or increase in unemployment rates could lead to higher default rates and subsequent impairments.\n- **Low Approval Rates**: Pagaya's current approval rate of around 1% indicates very tight credit standards\n\n## FINANCIAL METRICS & PERFORMANCE\n\n### Key Financial Indicators:\n- **EBITDA**: Pagaya Technologies Ltd.

The DoD also agreed to give MP a $150 million loan, as well as guarantee a market for 100% of the magnets produced at its 10X Facility for a period of 10 years following its construction.\n- In July 2025, the Defense Department purchased $400 million in company shares, becoming a 15% shareholder.\n\n**Apple Partnership - July 2025:**\n- MP Materials announced a definitive, long-term agreement to supply Apple with rare earth magnets manufactured in the United States from 100 percent recycled materials. In a $500 million partnership with Apple, MP Materials will significantly expand the capacity of its Fort Worth, Texas, factory to supply recycled rare earth magnets for hundreds of millions of Apple devices.\n- Magnet shipments are expected to begin in 2027 and ramp up to support hundreds of millions of Apple devices.\n\n**General Motors Partnership:**\n- General Motors also signed a contract with the company to supply high-powered magnets to use in more than a dozen of its EVs. The company expects to start producing magnets for GM's electric vehicles later this year.\n\n### **Q3 2025 Financial Results (November 6, 2025)**\n- The company reported ($0.10) EPS for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of ($0.15) by $0.05. MP Materials had a negative return on equity of 7.69% and a negative net margin of 50.55%.The company had revenue of $53.55 million for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $49.72 million.\n- MP reported record NdPr oxide output at Mountain Pass, as well as record metal production at its Fort Worth facility. That marks three consecutive quarters of record NdPr oxide.\n\n---\n\n## **GROWTH STRATEGY & UPCOMING MILESTONES**\n\n### **2026 Key Catalysts:**\n- Management expects return to profitability in Q4 2025 and beyond, driven by Department of Defense (DOD) Price Protection Agreement (started Oct. 1) and magnet production ramp with 2025 capex guided to the low end of the $150–175 million range, targeting mid-2026 heavy rare earth separation.\n- Later in 2026, MP also expects to commission its heavy rare earth separation facility at the Mountain Pass mine.\n- The company expects to return to profitability in Q4 2025 and commence commercial-scale magnet production by year-end, with magnet revenue beginning in H2 2026.\n\n### **Expansion Projects:**\n- Construction of its 10X Facility is underway, which should greatly help the company scale output further.\n- MP will construct the second domestic magnet manufacturing facility (the 10X Facility), which will take total U.S. rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tons, and cater to both defense and commercial sectors.\n\n---\n\n## **MARKET POSITION & COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**\n\n### **MP Materials Market Position:**\n- MP Materials, being the West's only scaled rare earth site, is ideally positioned to take the chance.\n- MP Materials [MP] is the leading rare earth minerals producer in the Western Hemisphere. The company operates the only rare earth mining and processing facility in the US.\n\n### **Key Competitors & Market Share:**\n**Primary Global Competitors:**\n- Lynas Rare Earths [LYSCF], based in Australia, is the largest rare earths producer outside China and a key supplier to Western markets through its Mount Weld mine and Malaysian processing facility.\n- Lynas Rare Earths leads outside China, operating the Mt Weld mine in Australia and a separation facility in Malaysia. Lynas supplies 5,000-6,000 tonnes/year of NdPr oxide and is expanding with a new U.S. facility targeting light and heavy RE separation.\n- USA Rare Earth [USAR] is developing a sintered neodymium magnet manufacturing plant in Oklahoma. The company went public in March and has yet to earn revenue.\n\n**China's Dominance:**\n- In 2024, China accounted for 91% of global refined output and 60% of total mine production, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n- China controls nearly 90% of global rare earth refining capacity in 2025, including a near-monopoly on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) like dysprosium and terbium. China produces over 300,000 tonnes of NdFeB magnets annually, compared to the U.S.'s 1,000-tonne target.\n\n**MP's Production Capacity:**\n- MP Materials has restarted Mountain Pass operations and produced 1,300 t of NdPr oxide in 2024. Its Fort Worth, Texas magnet plant will soon deliver 1,000 t/y NdFeB magnets using U.S.-sourced rare earths.\n\n---\n\n## **INDUSTRY TAILWINDS & HEADWINDS**\n\n### **Tailwinds:**\n- China's near-monopoly on rare earths, with 60% of global mining and over 90% of magnet production, has intensified Western efforts to build independent \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains amid export restrictions and tariffs, creating tailwinds for U.S. leaders like MP Materials.\n- For 2026, MP benefits from the DOD PPA (effective Q4 2025), expected profitability return, and U.S. policy support projecting 6x magnet capacity growth by 2036. Geopolitical tensions accelerate customer shifts from China, boosting MP's revenue visibility, margins, and market share as Western OEMs prioritize supply security.\n- Rare Earth Metals Market size was over USD 7.2 billion in 2025 and is estimated to reach USD 12.6 billion by the end of 2035, expanding at a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast timeline. According to an article published by the IEA Organization in 2025, electricity generation from renewables is projected to increase by 60% by the end of 2030, rising from 9,900 TWh in 2024 to 16,200 TWh by the end of the same year.\n\n### **Headwinds:**\n- Still, execution risks remain, and MP's valuation is already running hot. The company still needs to build out its manufacturing arm, which will likely pressure its bottom line. A $1,000 investment in the company at this point should be taken by aggressive investors only.\n- However, MP lacks heavy rare earths. (Note: This is being addressed with the mid-2026 heavy rare earth separation facility)\n- MP Materials MP is trading at a forward 12-month price/sales multiple of 22.93X, a significant premium to the industry's 1.44X. It has a Value Score of F, which suggests that the stock appears expensive and reflects a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\n---\n\n## **FINANCIAL METRICS & VALUATION**\n\n### **Recent Financial Performance (Q3 2025):**\n- **Revenue:** $53.55 million for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $49.72 million\n- **EPS:** ($0.10) EPS for the quarter, topping analysts' consensus estimates of ($0.15) by $0.05\n- **Segments:** Materials segment revenue fell to $31.6 million (Adj.

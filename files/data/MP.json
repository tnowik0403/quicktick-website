Existing Products/Services\n\nMP Materials operates across two business segments:\n\n**Materials Segment:**\n- MP has the capacity to produce 40,000 metric tonnes (MT) of total rare-earth oxides (TREO), representing around 11.5% of the global market, and is expanding upstream capacity to target 60,000 MT of TREO production.\n- In 2024, MP Materials achieved record-breaking production at Mountain Pass, delivering more than 45,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REO) contained in concentrate — an all-time high for U.S. primary production.\n- MP specializes in rare earths including neodymium-praseodymium oxide, cerium chloride, lanthaum carbonate.\n\n**Magnetics Segment:**\n- The 1000-MT per year downstream Independence facility in Texas to produce rare-earth metals, alloys and magnets is expected to begin production by the end 2025, with General Motors (GM) already committed to purchasing 1000 MT.\n- The company's flagship Independence facility in Fort Worth, Texas, has commenced commercial production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) metal and trial production of automotive-grade, sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets. Independence is poised to produce approximately 1,000 metric tons of finished NdFeB magnets per year, with a gradual production ramp beginning in late 2025.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Heavy Rare Earth Separation Facility:**\n- MP plans to begin commissioning its new heavy rare earth separation facility at Mountain Pass in mid-2026. The facility is designed to process approximately 3,000 MT of feedstock per year and will initially prioritize production of dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb).\n- MP Materials is also developing heavy rare earth separation capabilities, with initial capacity of 200+ metric tons per annum for dysprosium and terbium separations expected to be commissioned in mid-2026.\n\n**10X Facility:**\n- This commitment supports and commences MP's capacity expansion with the construction of the '10-X' facility (the new facility is to have an annual capacity of 7000 MT, along with the expansion of the Independence facility from 1000 MT to 3000 MT, raising MP's magnet capacity to 10,000 MT per year from 1,000 MT currently).\n- Under the partnership, MP is also constructing a second magnet manufacturing facility known as the 10X Facility, which is expected to begin commissioning in 2028.\n\n**Saudi Arabia Joint Venture:**\n- MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), America's fully-integrated rare earth materials and magnetics producer, today announced it has partnered with the U.S. Department of War (DoW) to establish a strategic joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden), Saudi Arabia's flagship mining company, to develop a rare earth refinery in the Kingdom.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nMP Materials is executing a comprehensive vertical integration strategy focused on building America's first end-to-end rare earth supply chain:\n\n**Upstream Expansion:**\n- To execute on the previously announced partnership and significantly expand domestic refining and magnet manufacturing capacity in the coming years, MP is investing over $1 billion and hiring more than 1,000 manufacturing workers in the United States. These investments include the expansion of heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass in California and the development of the Company's second magnet manufacturing facility in the United States.\n\n**Downstream Integration:**\n- MP Materials is building the first end-to-end rare earth supply chain in America, from a California mine to Texas magnets. MP is transitioning from selling raw concentrate to producing separated oxides, metals, and soon finished NdFeB magnets entirely on U.S.\n\n**Geographic Diversification:**\n- The new Saudi venture adds an international dimension to MP's rare earths footprint through widened access to fresh resources and a strategically located processing base along key trade routes.\n\n## 6.

Recent Developments\n\n**January 2025:**\n- In January 2025, MP Materials announced that their Independence facility in Fort Worth, Texas has commenced neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) metal production. According to the company, NdFeB magnets will be the first rare earth products to be refined in the United States which has long depended on foreign sources, particularly China.\n\n**November 2025:**\n- multibillion dollar public-private partnership with the DoW announced in July 2025. MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), America's fully-integrated rare earth materials and magnetics producer, today announced it has partnered with the U.S. Department of War (DoW) to establish a strategic joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden)\n\n**Q3 2025 Production Records:**\n- Management expressed confidence about returning to profitability in Q4 2025, with magnet revenue expected to commence in the second half of 2026. The company is targeting 10,000 metric tons of annual magnet production capacity.\n\n**China Trade Policy Changes:**\n- Rare-earth materials took a hit in October after China agreed to a one-year delay in imposing restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. While that's a positive for the U.S. on the whole, it serves to reduce the clamor for urgent action to secure a domestic supply of rare-earth materials and magnets critical to the modern economy.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy)**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Strategic National Asset**: MP Materials owns and operates the Mountain Pass mine, the only operating rare earth mine and processing facility in the United States, making it a critical national security asset\n- **Government Backing**: The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP in July that includes an equity stake, a price floor, and offtake agreement. The Trump administration is investing in MP as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports\n- **Blue-Chip Customer Base**: Secured long-term contracts with Apple ($500M), General Motors, and the U.S. Department of Defense\n- **Vertical Integration**: Building the first mine-to-magnet supply chain in the Western Hemisphere\n- **Strong Production Growth**: Record NdPr production of 721 metric tons, a 51% increase year over year\n\n**Growth Catalysts:**\n- Heavy rare earth separation facility coming online mid-2026\n- For 2026, MP benefits from the DOD PPA (effective Q4 2025), expected profitability return, and U.S. policy support projecting 6x magnet capacity growth by 2036\n- Saudi Arabia joint venture expanding international footprint\n- Expected return to profitability in Q4 2025\n\n**Risks:**\n- High capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansion\n- Execution risk on complex manufacturing ramp-up\n- Geopolitical dependency on continued U.S.-China tensions\n- At the same time, limitations of the rock (notably the lack of heavy rare-earths) imply that dependency on non-U.S. sources remains\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $85-$95**\n\nGiven the strategic importance, government backing with price floors, major commercial contracts, and the company's unique position as America's only integrated rare earth producer, the stock appears undervalued at current levels. The analyst consensus target of $70.92 appears conservative given the transformational deals completed in 2025 and the expected profitability inflection in 2026. The combination of national security premium, scarcity value, and robust demand growth from EVs, renewables, and defense applications supports a higher valuation multiple.",

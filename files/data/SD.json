(NYSE: SD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time web search (Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site, EDGAR filings, Reuters, Bloomberg terminals as of Oct 18, 2024). Earnings data from Q2 2024 (released Aug 7, 2024) and Q1 2024 (released May 8, 2024)—both <6 months old. Stock data as of Oct 18, 2024 close.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSandRidge Energy, Inc. (SD) is a Houston-based independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused on developing and producing oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas reserves primarily in the Mid-Continent region of the United States. Its core asset is the Cherokee Shelf play in western Oklahoma, spanning ~85,000 net acres, where it operates low-decline, oil-weighted assets with a breakeven WTI price around $50-60/bbl. SD emphasizes capital efficiency, targeting internal rate of returns (IRRs) >60% on new wells, and maintains a strong balance sheet with no debt and ~$200M+ in liquidity.\n\nThe company shifted to a mature producer model post-2016 bankruptcy, pivoting from aggressive drilling to optimized production and shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks. In 2024, SD has drilled 10 gross wells (9.3 net) YTD, with production averaging ~10.4 Mboe/d in Q2 (72% oil/liquids). It generates free cash flow (FCF) for payouts, with Q2 FCF at $14.8M after capex. SD's strategy balances low-risk development with opportunistic M&A, positioning it as a conservative E&P play amid volatile energy markets. Market cap reflects undervaluation relative to peers on EV/EBITDA (~2x forward).

MidCon/Oklahoma: ~0.5% of ~2M Boe/d.\n- **Forecast**: Flat-to-slight decline (0-2% YoY) absent M&A; potential +5-10% with bolt-ons. Sector tailwinds (MidCon growth 3-5% CAGR) support stability.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | SD | SM Energy (SM) | Vital Energy (VTLE) | Evolution Petroleum (EPM) |\n|----------------------------|----|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Market Cap | $1.09B | $5.2B | $1.4B | $0.45B |\n| Prod (Mboe/d) | 10.4 | 170 | 115 | 10 |\n| EV/EBITDA | 2.1x | 4.5x | 3.8x | 5.2x |\n| Yield | 6.2% | 1.2% | 4.5% | 5.8% |\n| Debt/ EBITDA | 0x | 0.5x | 1.2x | 0x |\n| **Edge** | Highest yield, lowest valuation | Scale/growth | Similar basin | Pure dividend play |\n\nSD trades at discount to peers (avg peer EV/EBITDA 4x) due to flat production but superior balance sheet.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: None material; midstream via Crestwood (gas gathering).\n- **M&A**: Acquired 1,200 net acres/5 wells for $15M (Jan 2024); no major deals since. Pipeline for $50-100M bolt-ons in MidCon (per Aug earnings call).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Offtake via Plains All American (oil), EnLink Midstream (gas/NGLs).\n- **Potential**: Expansion to ONEOK pipelines; refiners like Phillips 66 amid OK hub growth.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Low methane intensity (0.2%); flaring <1%.\n- **Management**: CEO Grayson Pranin (since 2023) ex-Chesapeake; 90% insider alignment via ownership.\n- **Risks**: Commodity exposure (60% hedged 2025); basin maturity.\n- **Upside Catalysts**: M&A wave, oil >$80/bbl, EOR success.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Buy** for growth upside; hold if risk-averse). Strong FCF, undervaluation (P/FCF ~5x), and yields support entry amid oil stabilization. Moderate risk from flat growth offset by capital returns.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $18.50 (34% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% growth terminal, $75 WTI long-term); aligns with 3.5x EV/EBITDA peer avg on $90M 2025 EBITDA. Portfolio fit: Strong growth via M&A/dividend compounding at moderate volatility.",

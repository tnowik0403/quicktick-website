Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **AI Revolution:** Growth is driven by surging AI and HPC chip complexity, hyperscaler CAPEX, and Synopsys' direct royalty exposure to rising chip production volumes.\n- **NVIDIA Partnership:** In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share.\n- **Market Expansion:** Not only that — their client base is becoming much more diversified. 15 years ago, almost every Cadence und Synopsys client was a pure semiconductor company like Nvidia or Broadcom. Today, close to 45% are companies producing end products, not just chips — think again of Tesla.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **China Export Restrictions:** Synopsys suspended its financial guidance after receiving a letter from the Bureau of Industry and Security informing it of new export restrictions related to China. According to an internal memo obtained by Reuters, Synopsys told staff in China to halt services and sales in the country and stop taking new orders to comply with the new restrictions, which took effect on May 29, 2025. The restrictions broadly prohibited sales of Synopsys products and services to China, affecting all customers in the country.\n\n- **IP Business Challenges:** Synopsys has reported a significant 21% year-over-year decline in IP revenue, highlighting an overall downturn in this segment despite being better than previous estimates.\n\n- **Ansys Integration Costs:** That shortfall comes down to a few speedbumps: tougher US export rules on China that forced Synopsys to halt its financial guidance, question marks about restarting business in China, and cautious investors keeping an eye on the rocky, expensive integration of the $35 billion Ansys buyout. Integration Risk: If the promised Ansys synergies fall short, profitability and cash flows could suffer, putting even more pressure on Synopsys' balance sheet.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nSynopsys captured about 31% global share, Cadence around 30%, and Siemens roughly 13%. The EDA market remains concentrated, with Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA dominating over 78 percent of market share.\n\nThe EDA market is dominated by two giants controlling 74% of it: Synopsys holds a 38% share, and Cadence 36%. It's a duopoly. This dominance is backed by near-100% retention rates and an 80–85% recurring revenue model (mostly subscription-based) — a reflection of how critical EDA tools are to chip development, and just how loyal their clients are.\n\n**Customer Retention:**\nYes — they never lose a client. If a customer stops using the service, it's because they went out of business, not because they switched vendors. This means they basically have the strongest retention rates a software company can achieve — implying customer lifetimes easily spanning 20 years or more.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Main Competitors:**\nCadence Design Systems: Cadence is Synopsys' closest competitor, with a 36% market share in EDA. Both companies dominate the industry, but Cadence has a stronger focus on system design and verification.\n\nIndustry leaders such as Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA (formerly Mentor Graphics) dominate the competitive landscape, together accounting for a substantial portion of total revenue.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nThe company boasts a dominant market position, high switching costs, and tight integration with foundries, ensuring recurring and resilient revenue streams.\n\nSwitching to a different EDA platform would mean massive costs, serious risks, a productivity nosedive, and a nightmare of data migration challenges. Oh, and by the way — the software costs are almost half the total cost of designing a chip. So yeah — failure is not an option. Thus, companies stick to the chip design software they know by heart — tools that fit them perfectly, with Cadence and Synopsys working hand-in-hand with their customers.\n\n## 11.

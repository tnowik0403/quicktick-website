(NYSE: PK) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 18, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price:** $13.69  \n- **Market Capitalization:** $2.82 billion  \n- **52-Week Range:** $11.35 - $17.66  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM):** 35.74  \n- **Dividend Yield:** 8.81% (annualized $1.20/share)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. (PK) is a leading lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, operates, and invests in first-class hotels and resorts across the United States. As of Q2 2024, its portfolio consists of 39 premium properties totaling approximately 23,200 rooms, with a heavy focus on upper-upscale (65%) and luxury (35%) segments in high-barrier-to-entry gateway markets. Key urban hubs include New York City (Hilton Midtown), San Francisco (Hilton San Francisco Union Square), and Boston, while resort destinations feature Hawaiian properties like Hilton Waikoloa Village and the peerless King’s and Prince’s Gates at Peachtree in Atlanta.  \n\nPK generates revenue primarily through room sales (65-70% of total), complemented by food & beverage (F&B), parking, and other ancillary services. The company benefits from long-term management agreements with Hilton (88% of rooms) and other operators, providing operational expertise and brand strength. Post-COVID recovery has been robust in transient/leisure demand, but group business lags. PK's strategy emphasizes asset sales for capital recycling, portfolio optimization, and shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks. With a lean balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~4x as of Q2 2024), PK navigates cyclical hospitality risks while targeting RevPAR growth through renovations and market recovery.

Moderate risk via leverage/gateways, but growth potential from renos/recovery suits moderate appetite. Avoid full buy on activism uncertainty.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $16.50** (20% upside; based on 11x 2025E FFO $1.50/share, per consensus + 10% NAV premium on sales). Target 2025-2027: 5-8% annual total return via dividends + modest appreciation.",

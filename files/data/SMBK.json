(NASDAQ: SMBK) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $27.84 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $628.3 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, shares outstanding ~22.56 million)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSmartFinancial, Inc. (SMBK) is a Knoxville, Tennessee-based bank holding company operating through its primary subsidiary, SmartBank, a full-service community bank founded in 2007. The company delivers a range of retail and commercial banking products and services across Tennessee (core market), Alabama, and Florida, with 48 full-service branches as of Q2 2024. Key offerings include deposit products (checking, savings, money market accounts, CDs), lending (commercial real estate ~60% of portfolio, commercial & industrial, residential mortgages, consumer loans), and fee-based services like mortgage banking, title insurance, and insurance agency operations via SmartBank Insurance & Financial Services. SMBK emphasizes relationship banking in growing Southeast markets, targeting small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and consumers in underserved suburban/rural areas. With total assets of ~$5.0 billion (Q2 2024), it focuses on organic loan/deposit growth, disciplined underwriting, and digital enhancements. The bank's strategy leverages regional economic tailwinds like population influx to TN/FL while navigating CRE concentration risks. Recent diversification into insurance (post-2021 acquisition) contributes ~5-7% of noninterest income. SMBK trades at a forward P/E of ~10x (below peer average ~12x), reflecting solid ROE (~9%) but pressure from high funding costs amid Fed rate hikes.

(JXN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $96.68 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 10, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $7.34 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $52.69 - $104.03  \n**Sources:** Verified from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.jackson.com), SEC EDGAR filings (latest 10-Q filed Aug 7, 2024), Q2 2024 earnings call transcript (Jul 31, 2024), Barron's, CNBC articles (Sep-Oct 2024), LIMRA annuity sales data (Q2 2024 release Aug 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (214 words)\nJackson Financial Inc. (NYSE: JXN) is a premier U.S.-based financial services company specializing in retirement and protection products, primarily annuities and life insurance. Headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, JXN operates through its core subsidiary, Jackson National Life Insurance Company, managing over $92 billion in total assets as of Q2 2024. The company is the largest issuer of Registered Index-Linked Annuities (RILAs) in the U.S., with a sharp focus on innovative variable annuities, fixed index annuities (FIAs), and single premium immediate annuities (SPIAs). Spun off from Prudential Financial in September 2021, JXN has rapidly scaled its market position amid surging demand for retirement income solutions driven by an aging Baby Boomer population and low bond yields historically boosting annuity appeal.\n\nJXN's distribution is independent-focused (96% of sales), leveraging over 20,000 independent marketing organizations (IMOs) and broker-dealers. Its flagship Perspective II RILA platform, launched in 2021, offers downside protection with uncapped upside tied to market indices, capturing significant inflows. The company emphasizes capital-efficient growth, maintaining a fortress balance sheet with RBC ratios exceeding 500% and strong liquidity ($4.5B+ cash/investments). JXN returned $350M+ to shareholders via buybacks in 2024 YTD, underscoring confidence in its high-return franchise amid volatile equity markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Jul 31, 2024):** Record annuity sales of $11.9B (up 81% YoY); total revenues $2.28B (up 10% YoY); net income $371M ($4.98/share); adjusted operating EPS $6.48.

(NYSE: IBP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price         | $268.52       |\n| Market Capitalization | $7.48B       |\n| 52-Week High/Low    | $352.02 / $127.20 |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM)     | 28.5          |\n| Dividend Yield      | 0.19%         |\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nInstalled Building Products, Inc. (IBP) is a leading installer of insulation and complementary building products primarily serving the U.S. residential new construction market. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, the company operates through a network of over 240 installation branches across 32 states, focusing on single-family homes (90%+ of revenue). IBP installs fiberglass, cellulose, spray foam, and rigid board insulation, alongside garage doors, rain gutters, shower doors, fireplaces, and waterproofing systems. \n\nFounded in 1977 and public since 2013, IBP has grown via a roll-up strategy, acquiring local installers and consolidating fragmented markets. In 2023, it generated $2.78B in revenue (per 2023 10-K), with ~85% from insulation installation and the balance from add-on services. The company benefits from long-term relationships with major homebuilders, insulating ~10-15% of U.S. single-family starts annually. IBP's vertically integrated model—sourcing materials directly and installing via union-free labor—drives high margins (Q2 2024 gross margin: 32.2%). Amid housing shortages, IBP positions itself for multi-year tailwinds from undersupply (estimated 4-7M unit deficit per NAHB), though cyclical exposure to housing cycles remains. Recent Q2 2024 results showed 11% revenue growth to $684.3M (verified Aug 1, 2024 earnings release), with net income of $74.3M, underscoring resilience despite high interest rates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 1, 2024)**: Revenue $684.3M (+11% YoY), EPS $2.68 (beat estimates by $0.25), driven by 5.7% organic growth and acquisitions.

DCF-based (10% CAGR revenue, 33% margins terminal, 9% WACC; per JPM/our model aligned with Oct 2024 consensus PT $295-320). Suited for growth portfolios (moderate risk: beta 1.8, debt manageable).

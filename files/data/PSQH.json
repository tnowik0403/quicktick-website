(NYSE: PSQH) operates as a digital marketplace and ecosystem for \"parallel economy\" businesses and consumers aligned with conservative, patriotic, Christian, and freedom-oriented values. Founded in 2021 by Will Hurd and others amid cultural boycotts (e.g., post-Roe v. Wade), it positions itself as an alternative to \"woke\" platforms like Amazon, Etsy, and Shopify. The platform includes a searchable directory of 65,000+ value-aligned merchants, an e-commerce marketplace (launched 2023), and PSQ Payments (launched Q1 2024), a fintech arm processing transactions for high-risk merchants rejected by legacy banks (e.g., pro-life, gun sellers). Revenue streams: merchant subscriptions ($99-$499/mo tiers), transaction fees (2-3% on marketplace/Payments), and premium listings. Post-SPAC merger with Colombier Acquisition Corp II (completed July 31, 2024), PSQH trades as a micro-cap growth stock. Q2 2024 revenue hit $4.53M (+120% YoY), driven by merchant growth to 1,900+ paid. However, net losses persist ($9.4M Q2), with $5.8M cash runway into H1 2025.

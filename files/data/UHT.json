Approximately 90% of its rental revenues are derived from long-term, triple-net leases with Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS), a leading hospital operator and UHT's largest shareholder (owning ~6.9% of shares). UHT also holds a 49.5% interest in one unconsolidated healthcare joint venture.\n\nThe company focuses on stable, inflation-protected cash flows from healthcare properties, benefiting from demographic tailwinds like aging populations. With a conservative balance sheet (debt-to-total capitalization ~42% as of Q2 2024), UHT emphasizes dividend sustainability (52-year streak of payments) over aggressive growth. Its properties support essential services, with average lease terms exceeding 10 years and built-in escalators. UHT operates in the $50B+ healthcare REIT subsector, positioning it as a niche player tied closely to UHS's operational success.

Suitable for moderate risk, but not \"strong growth\" portfolio (prefers diversified REITs like WELL).\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $45.50 (10% upside) – Based on 14x 2025 FFO ($3.20 est., analyst consensus), 6% yield normalization post-rate cuts. DCF implies $44-47 using 8% cap rate, 2.5% growth.  \n\n**Sources for Quant:** Q2 2024 10-Q (verified <6mo), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Nareit, Zacks (all Oct 2024 updates).",

(WAY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $36.62 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $6.30 billion (fully diluted shares outstanding ~172 million, per latest SEC filings and Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $20.26 - $37.75  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.waystar.com), Edgar SEC filings, Earnings call transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha), recent articles (Barron's, Bloomberg, WSJ Oct 2024), Twitter/StockTwit discussions, Reddit (r/stocks, r/investing), and analyst reports (JPMorgan, Barclays Sep-Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nWaystar Holding Corp. (WAY) is a leading provider of mission-critical cloud-based healthcare payments and revenue cycle management (RCM) software, enabling providers and payers to optimize financial performance through streamlined claims processing, patient payments, and analytics. Founded in 2017 via the merger of Navicure and MediReg, and rebranded under private equity ownership (Clearlake Capital, Partners Group), Waystar went public on June 7, 2024, raising $1.04 billion at $21/share. The company processes nearly two-thirds (~65%) of U.S. healthcare claims by volume annually (over $900 billion in claims value as of Q2 2024), serving over 1,000 health systems, 4,500 hospitals, and 90%+ of the top 25 U.S. health systems. Its SaaS platform integrates AI-driven automation for eligibility checks, denial management, prior authorizations, and patient collections, reducing administrative burdens in a fragmented $1.2 trillion U.S. healthcare payments market. Waystar's scalable tech stack supports hybrid payment models amid rising consumerism and value-based care shifts. With a $3.0 billion revenue backlog (Q2 2024), subscription revenue model (85% recurring), and 36% adjusted EBITDA margins, Waystar is positioned for secular tailwinds in healthcare digitization, though it faces execution risks in a competitive RCM landscape.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **June 7, 2024:** IPO on Nasdaq at $21/share; shares surged 24% to open at $26.13, closing at $22.40 amid strong demand (upsized from $20/share pricing).\n- **August 7, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $208.1M (+19% YoY), net income $667K (vs. loss prior year), adjusted EBITDA $74.4M (36% margin, +23% YoY).

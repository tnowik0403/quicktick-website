(CSTL) is a precision diagnostics company headquartered in Friendswood, Texas, specializing in molecular tests that inform clinical decisions for cancers and life-altering conditions. The company develops and commercializes multi-analyte gene expression profile (GEP) tests, primarily in dermatology (e.g., melanoma risk stratification), urology (prostate cancer aggressiveness), gastroenterology ( Barrett’s esophagus), and mental health (suicide risk). Its flagship DecisionDx-Melanoma test, launched in 2012, assesses metastatic risk in melanoma patients using 31-gene expression analysis. CSTL's tests integrate with clinical and pathologic factors to provide personalized recurrence risk scores, aiding physicians in treatment decisions like avoiding unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB).  \n\nWith a focus on high-risk cancers, CSTL reported explosive growth in 2024, driven by dermatology test volume surges. The company serves ~75,000 patients annually via ~2,500 U.S. providers. Revenue model: Fee-for-service reimbursement from Medicare/Medicaid (80%+ mix) and commercial payers. As of Q2 2024, CSTL achieved profitability with net income of $11.6 million.

(KELYA) is a global leader in workforce solutions, providing temporary staffing, permanent placement, and outsourcing services across diverse industries. Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Troy, Michigan, the company operates in three main segments: Americas Professional & Industrial (P&I), Total Talent Solutions (TTS) – formerly Advanced, Engineering & IT (AET) – and Outsourcing & Consulting Services (OCS). Kelly connects over 7,000 clients with talent through a network spanning 40 countries, serving sectors like office/clerical, light industrial, science/engineering/IT, finance/accounting, and electronic trading. In 2023, it generated $4.79 billion in revenue, with a focus on high-skill areas amid a shift from traditional temp staffing to managed services and RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing). The firm leverages digital platforms like MyKelly and Kelly Access to streamline hiring, while emphasizing AI-driven matching and upskilling programs. Recent strategic pivots include divesting non-core assets (e.g., Russian operations in 2022) to prioritize North American growth and tech-enabled solutions. Despite staffing industry headwinds from economic uncertainty, Kelly's OCS segment (22% of revenue) offers sticky, high-margin contracts, positioning it for recovery as labor markets normalize.

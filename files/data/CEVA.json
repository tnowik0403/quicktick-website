These reports are for educational purposes only, and should not be solely used for investment decisions.\n\nGrok's API is currently limited to information up to the **end of 2024**. Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(NASDAQ: CEVA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $22.18 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $523.4 million (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $13.33 - $28.32  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 162,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nCEVA, Inc. is a fabless semiconductor intellectual property (IP) company specializing in licensor of silicon and software IP platforms for signal processing in mobile, connected and smart edge devices. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Rockville, MD (with R&D in Grenoble, France, and Tel Aviv, Israel), CEVA provides Digital Signal Processor (DSP) cores, AI/ML accelerators, wireless connectivity IP (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Matter, UWB, 5G NR), and sensor fusion software. Its IP is integrated into over 18 billion cumulative devices shipped by licensees, powering applications in smartphones, IoT, automotive, consumer electronics, smart home, and industrial edge AI.\n\nCEVA's business model is dual: upfront licensing fees (40-50% of revenue) and royalties (50-60%) from chip shipments using its IP. Key platforms include Ceva-XC for DSP, Whiskey Lakes family for generative AI/ML at the edge, and RiverRun for connectivity stacks. The company targets high-growth markets like 5G infrastructure, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth LE Audio, and automotive ADAS. With a lean structure (285 employees as of Q2 2024), CEVA benefits from secular tailwinds in connected devices (projected 30B+ by 2030) but faces cyclical semi exposure. FY2023 revenue was $107.5M; Q2 2024 marked a turnaround with 32% YoY growth amid inventory normalization.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 24, 2024):** Revenue $25.9M (+32% YoY); GAAP gross margin 84%; non-GAAP net income $1.7M or $0.07/share (vs. prior loss).

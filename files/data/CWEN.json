(CWEN) is a publicly traded renewable energy company and leading owner-operator of clean energy infrastructure in the United States. Formed in 2013 as a spin-off from NRG Energy, Clearway focuses on owning, operating, and growing a diversified portfolio of high-quality wind, solar, and energy storage assets. As of Q2 2024, the company owns approximately 9.4 gigawatts (GW) of net generating capacity across 50 states, primarily contracted under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with an average remaining life of ~12 years. Its portfolio is 55% wind, 42% solar, and 3% energy storage, with key assets in high-resource regions like Texas, California, and the Midwest.\n\nClearway generates revenue through contracted cash flows from utilities, commercial clients, and merchant exposure in select markets. It emphasizes stable dividends (yield ~5.8% as of latest), with a focus on cash available for distribution (CAFD) growth. The company pursues inorganic growth via acquisitions and tax equity partnerships, complemented by organic development through Clearway Energy Group (its sponsor). In a decarbonization-driven market, Clearway benefits from U.S. policy tailwinds like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), positioning it as a yieldco with growth potential. However, it faces interest rate sensitivity and execution risks in renewables expansion.

Unlike traditional community banks, FBIZ targets middle-market businesses with revenues of $5M-$150M, prioritizing high-margin, relationship-driven lending over retail deposit gathering.\n\nAs of Q3 2024 (ended September 30, 2024; reported October 24, 2024), FBIZ managed $4.1 billion in total assets, $3.3 billion in loans, and $3.5 billion in deposits.

Revenue streams are diversified: ~80% net interest income (NII), 15% fee income from wealth/trust, and 5% from mortgage banking. FBIZ has delivered consistent profitability, with ROE averaging 18-20% over the past 5 years, driven by disciplined underwriting and low charge-offs (0.25% annualized in Q3 2024).

Rationale: 12% earnings growth > peers, resilient NIM, undervalued at 11.8x fwd P/E (peer avg 10x). Recent rate cuts favor asset-sensitive balance sheet (+$4M NII est. 2025).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $45.00 (20% upside). Based on 14x 2025 EPS consensus $3.20 (Zacks/earnings guide), implying 18% ROE sustainability. Moderate risk: Diversified loans mitigate CRE (~$800M exposure, LTV<70%). Target timeline: 12 months.",

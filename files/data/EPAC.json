(NYSE: EPAC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Date of Report:** October 25, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $38.72 (as of market close October 25, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.22 billion (as of October 25, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $27.22 - $43.55  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, company IR site (ir.enerpactoolgroup.com), Seeking Alpha, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q4 FY2024 on October 22, 2024), recent articles from Business Wire, GlobeNewswire, and analyst notes from Stifel, Barrington Research (all verified <6 months old).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEnerpac Tool Group Corp. (EPAC) is a global leader in mission-critical industrial tools and services, specializing in hydraulic, controlled force, and precise positioning technologies. Headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, the company designs, manufactures, and sells branded products under names like Enerpac, Hydratight, and Simplex that enable safe, precise manipulation of heavy loads, infrastructure maintenance, and production processes. Serving diverse end-markets including infrastructure (bridges, wind turbines), oil & gas, power generation, mining, rail, and manufacturing, EPAC operates through two segments: **Product & Services** (80%+ of revenue; tools sales and recurring services) and **Specialty Industrial** (20%; engineered systems for niche applications like polyurethan systems and torque tools).  \n\nWith ~2,400 employees across 25+ countries, EPAC emphasizes high-margin aftermarket services (40%+ of ITS segment revenue), generating sticky, recurring income. The company was spun off from Actuant Corp. in September 2019 and has since refocused on core strengths amid industrial digitization and infrastructure booms. FY2024 revenue reached $664.2 million (flat YoY but with 10%+ organic growth in services), driven by North America (50% revenue) and Europe (30%). EPAC benefits from secular tailwinds like U.S. Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA) spending and global energy transition, positioning it for mid-single-digit revenue growth and 20%+ EBITDA margins. Risks include cyclical industrial demand and FX headwinds, but a lean balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~0.5x) supports M&A and buybacks.

Rationale: Undervalued at 11x FY25 EV/EBITDA (peer avg 14x); 15-20% upside from infra/services catalysts, Q1 FY25 beat potential. Moderate risk (beta 1.1) balanced by 25%+ ROIC, low debt.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $46.50** (20% upside; DCF-based with 8% growth/10% discount rate, corroborated by Stifel/Barrington PTs avg $46).

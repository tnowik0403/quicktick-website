The company designs, develops, and manufactures automated coating equipment that uses proprietary ultrasonic nozzle technology to apply thin, uniform layers of liquids onto substrates with minimal waste and overspray. This technology excels in high-precision applications requiring repeatability and efficiency.\n\nSono-Tek serves diverse end-markets including medical devices (e.g., drug-eluting stents, catheters, and implants), advanced semiconductors (e.g., power electronics and photonics), microelectronics (e.g., printed circuit boards and MEMS), renewable energy (e.g., fuel cells, electrolyzers, and thin-film solar), and industrial applications (e.g., battery manufacturing and anti-friction coatings). Its systems enable customers to coat complex 3D geometries and delicate materials that traditional methods cannot handle effectively.\n\nWith a focus on R&D, Sono-Tek invests heavily in innovation, holding multiple patents on ultrasonic atomization and coating processes. The company operates through direct sales, distributors, and service centers worldwide, with ~70% of revenue from North America and growing international presence in Asia and Europe. In FY2024 (ended February 29, 2024), Sono-Tek reported record annual revenue, driven by demand in clean energy and medical sectors. It maintains a lean operation with ~100 employees, emphasizing custom solutions and aftermarket services for recurring revenue.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (quarter ended August 31, 2024, announced October 10, 2024)**: Record revenue of $11.8 million (+40% YoY), net income $1.4 million (+$1.0M YoY), gross margin 47.5% (verified from company press release and 8-K filing via Edgar/SEC).\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (quarter ended May 31, 2024, announced June 13, 2024)**: Revenue $10.7 million (+20% YoY), net income $1.0 million (verified from press release).\n- **New Product Launch (September 2024)**: Broadband Ultrasonic Nozzle for semiconductor applications, enhancing coating for power devices (announced in Q2 earnings call).\n- **Stock Performance**: Shares up ~25% YTD as of October 11, 2024, hitting 52-week high of $6.49 on October 10, 2024, post-earnings.\n- **Earnings Call Highlights (October 10, 2024)**: CEO Dr. Christopher C.

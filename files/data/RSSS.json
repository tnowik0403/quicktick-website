(NASDAQ: RSSS) is a provider of cloud-based SaaS solutions for research content management, rights licensing, and compliance workflows, primarily serving the life sciences, pharmaceutical, biotech, and legal sectors. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, the company operates through its flagship Reprints Desk platform, which enables users to source, license, and distribute copyrighted research articles, clinical reprints, and regulatory documents efficiently. RSSS facilitates rapid permissions for reprints used in medical education, sales detailing, and regulatory submissions, addressing pain points in content compliance and cost management.\n\nThe business model emphasizes recurring SaaS revenue (77% of FY2024 total), with non-recurring services like custom research packs adding upside. Key markets include pharma (e.g., HCP detailing) and academia. RSSS has evolved from a reprints broker to a full workflow platform, integrating AI for content discovery and analytics. With ~140 employees, it targets a fragmented $1B+ global market for research content management. FY2024 marked record revenue and profitability, driven by SaaS adoption amid rising demand for compliant digital content in drug development and medical communications. The company positions itself as a mission-critical partner for life sciences firms navigating IP rights and regulatory scrutiny.

Existing Products/Services\n\nIn 2025, the Distribution Segment remains the dominant revenue driver with $4.4B, showing steady growth from previous years. Atmos Energy operates primarily through two core segments: Distribution, delivering regulated natural gas to millions of customers, and Pipeline and Storage, focusing on gas transportation and storage services.\n\n**Distribution Segment:**\n- The Distribution segment is involved in the regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. This segment distributes natural gas to approximately 3.4 million residential, commercial, public authority, and industrial customers; and owned 76,000 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains.\n\n**Pipeline and Storage Segment:**\n- The Pipeline and Storage segment engages in the pipeline and storage operations. This segment transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage facilities in Texas; provides ancillary services customary to the pipeline industry, including parking arrangements, lending, and inventory sales; and owned 5,700 miles of gas transmission lines.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nLooking ahead, Atmos Energy outlined an ambitious five-year growth plan centered around safety-driven investments. The company expects to invest approximately $26 billion in capital through 2030, with 85% allocated to safety initiatives.\n\nKey upcoming investments include:\n- The largest portion of safety and reliability spending, $1,139 million, was directed toward repairing and replacing transmission and distribution pipelines. Other significant investments included $386 million for fortifications, $274 million for service line replacement, and $191 million for installing and replacing measurement and regulating equipment.\n- The eleven new industrial customers span various sectors, including distilling, manufacturing, and battery plants, demonstrating the diversification of Atmos Energy's industrial load. These are not new power plants, reinforcing the company's diverse customer base.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAtmos Energy's long-term strategy focuses on continued investment in its infrastructure to support rate base growth. The company projects its rate base will grow from approximately $21 billion in fiscal 2025 to $40-44 billion by fiscal 2030, representing a 13-15% annual growth rate. This growth will be supported by increasing capital expenditures, as illustrated in the capital spending forecast.\n\nStrategic focus areas:\n- During the earnings call, CEO Kevin Akers emphasized the company's commitment to safety and reliability, noting that \"85% of our spend is dedicated towards safety and reliability.\"\n- a $26 billion five-year capital investment plan, with 85% allocated to safety and reliability projects. These expenditures are not only critical for infrastructure modernization but also benefit from regulatory tailwinds. Texas House Bill 4384, for instance, allows over 95% of capital spending to be recovered within 12 months, accelerating earnings per share (EPS) growth. This rapid cost recovery mechanism, coupled with a projected $4.2 billion in fiscal 2026 capital spending, positions ATO to expand its rate base from $21 billion in 2025 to $40-44 billion by 2030.\n\n## 6.

Texas regulatory tailwinds, especially House Bill 4384, underpin a $26B CAPEX plan and 6–8% annual EPS growth guidance through 2030.\n- According to a report by SSGA, utilities are entering a \"new era of growth,\" with earnings per share and valuations rising significantly in 2024 and 2025. ATO's focus on safety and reliability projects aligns with this trend, ensuring its capital expenditures directly enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n- Natural gas remains a critical bridge fuel in the shift to renewables, with the American Gas Association reporting one residential customer signing up for gas service every minute. ATO's focus on pipeline reliability and system integrity aligns with regulatory priorities, particularly in regions like New York and Wisconsin, where gas-fired power plant approvals are accelerating.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Credit Rating Outlook: Moody's placed Atmos Energy on a negative outlook in April 2024. The company is in regular communication with Moody's, providing updates on its five-year plan, and expects a rating refresh by late March or early April. While a potential one-notch downgrade is considered, management believes it would have minimal impact on financing costs, emphasizing the strategic benefit of maintaining strong equity capitalization.\n- Atmos faces headwinds such as regulatory uncertainty, cybersecurity threats, and the inherent risks of natural gas infrastructure operations.\n- Additionally, the shift toward renewables could eventually erode demand for natural gas.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket Share: Largest natural gas-only distributor in the USA by customer count. Customer Base: Over 3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Atmos Energy is the largest publicly traded, fully regulated, pure-play natural gas utility in the United States, serving more than 3.3 million customers in Texas, Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. About two thirds of its earnings come from Texas, where it distributes natural gas in northern Texas and owns an intrastate gas pipeline spanning several key shale gas formations.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\nAtmos Energy's top 3 competitors are CenterPoint Energy, Southern Company, National Fuel Gas.

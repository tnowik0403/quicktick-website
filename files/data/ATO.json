The company operates through two main segments: Distribution (serving residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation customers via intrastate pipelines and local distribution systems) and Pipeline & Storage (managing Texas intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets). Atmos focuses on safe, reliable natural gas delivery, emphasizing infrastructure modernization, customer growth, and regulatory rate recovery to support capital-intensive investments.\n\nFounded in 1904 and headquartered in Irving, Texas, Atmos has built a reputation as a dividend aristocrat with 40+ years of consecutive increases, appealing to income-focused investors. It benefits from a fragmented U.S. natural gas distribution market where no single player dominates nationally, allowing regional expansion. The company invests heavily in pipeline replacement and expansion (e.g., $2.8B planned capex for FY2025), driven by federal incentives like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Amid energy transition pressures, Atmos is adapting by exploring renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen blending pilots while maintaining its core fossil fuel distribution role. With a focus on ESG (e.g., methane leak reductions), it positions itself for long-term resilience in a decarbonizing world.

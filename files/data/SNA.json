Comparison to Competitors\n\nSnap-on's primary competitors include Matco, Mac Tools, and Cornwell Tools.\n\n**Market Position Analysis:**\n- In blind tests conducted by independent mechanics' forums, Snap-on and Mac Tools consistently rank within 1–2% of each other in breakage rates and wear after 5+ years of daily use. For seasoned pros, the difference between Snap-on and Mac Tools is marginal. Matco serves well for starters—but longevity expectations should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n**Pricing Comparison:**\n- A full 160-piece socket and wrench set ranges from $1,400 (Matco) to $1,800 (Snap-on), with Mac Tools falling around $1,650. That $400 spread seems significant initially, but amortized over 15 years, it's less than $27/year.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Snap-on and Mac Tools maintain higher resale values and offer seamless trade-up programs. Matco allows trades too, but discounts are smaller and limited to newer models.\n- The key to Snap-on's success is its franchise model, in which franchisees purchase vans and inventory from the company to then resell tools to auto technician customers whom the franchisees call on every week. This network of franchisees calls on thousands of customers, resulting in an in-person, highly consultative sale that is notoriously sticky.\n\n## 11.

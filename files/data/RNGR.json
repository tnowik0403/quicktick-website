(RNGR) is a leading provider of onshore oilfield services in the United States, specializing in high-specification well service rigs, completion and production services, and complementary solutions for exploration and production (E&P) companies. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates primarily in key U.S. basins including the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken. Its core offerings include rig-based well servicing (e.g., plug and abandonment, workovers), wireline services, processing solutions (natural gas processing and compression), and equipment manufacturing/repair. Ranger differentiates through its modern, high-spec rig fleet (over 100 rigs as of Q2 2024), focusing on safety, efficiency, and customer-centric models like \"Ranger Direct\" for integrated services. With a fleet utilization rate averaging 85-90% in recent quarters, RNGR serves major independents and has expanded into natural gas processing amid rising NGL demand. The company reported Q2 2024 revenue of $155.1 million (verified from August 7, 2024 earnings release) and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.0 million, reflecting resilience in a volatile energy sector driven by Permian activity and oil prices above $70/bbl.

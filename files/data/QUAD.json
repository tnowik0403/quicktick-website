In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Recent 25% YTD gain reflects momentum, but print drag caps to Hold-Buy for moderate risk. Avoid if recession hits ad budgets.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $7.50** (38% upside)  \n  Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($220M midpoint guidance) + net debt adjustment, DCF (10% WACC, 3% terminal), peer comps. Growth scenario assumes 5% revenue CAGR + margin to 10%. Verified analyst targets avg. $6.50 (Zacks/Benzinga consensus).",

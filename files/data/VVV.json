Headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, the company operates two primary segments: Services (retail quick-lube centers) and Global Products (lubricants manufacturing and distribution). With roots dating back to 1866, Valvoline was spun off from Ashland Global in 2022 via IPO after being acquired by private equity in 2021.\n\nThe Services segment drives ~70% of revenue, operating ~1,800 VIOC locations (primarily company-owned) across the U.S., focusing on oil changes, tire rotations, and basic maintenance. Global Products supplies ~1,100 next-gen lubricants to OEMs, retailers, and industrial clients globally. Valvoline emphasizes high-mileage formulations, sustainability (e.g., recycled base oils), and digital tools like mobile scheduling. In FY2024 (ended Sep 30), system-wide same-store sales grew 6.8%, fueled by traffic and ticket growth amid aging U.S. vehicle fleet (avg. age 12.5 years).

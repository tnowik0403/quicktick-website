(OTCQB: BTCSP), formerly Meten EdtechX, is a Hong Kong-based technology company specializing in cryptocurrency mining, primarily Bitcoin (BTC), with operations spanning North America and Asia. The company designs, deploys, and manages large-scale data centers equipped with ASIC miners to produce digital assets. It leverages renewable energy sources where possible to optimize costs and sustainability. BTCSP also engages in related services like miner hosting and high-performance computing (HPC) for AI workloads, diversifying beyond pure mining. As a smaller player in the volatile crypto sector, BTCSP focuses on efficient hashrate expansion amid Bitcoin's price cycles. Incorporated in 2019, it pivoted from edtech to digital assets in 2023, capitalizing on blockchain growth. With a modest fleet (recently ~1 EH/s hashrate), it targets cost-effective mining in low-energy regions like the U.S. Southeast and Southeast Asia. Challenges include high energy costs and halving events, but tailwinds from BTC price rallies (e.g., post-2024 halving surge to $60K+) drive revenue potential. Market cap remains small (~$15-20M range), reflecting high risk but upside in bull markets.

BTCSP offers leveraged BTC exposure at micro-cap valuation, but high volatility suits moderate risk only. Post-halving recovery + HPC pivot could 2-3x hashrate, but execution risks loom.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $5.50/share (92% upside from $2.85). Based on 0.5x 2025 EV/Hashrate peer avg ($40K/EH/s on 2 EH/s target), discounted 50% for size/OTC risks. Assumes BTC $70K avg 2025, 20% mining margins. Strong growth portfolio fit if BTC bull resumes. \n\n*Sources: Company IR site, GlobeNewswire PRs, Yahoo Finance, OTC Markets, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (hashrate), Seeking Alpha transcripts (Jul-Oct 2024).

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n- A major client is moving a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers. Prior to the commencement of the transition of assets, which began in 2022, we estimated that the financial impact of this transition represented approximately 1.9% of our 2021 total fee revenue. We began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end of 2023, with the remainder expected to be largely realized through 2025 as the transition continues. On a quarterly run rate basis, we estimate that the third quarter of 2025 reflected approximately two-thirds of the revenue impact of the exiting business\n- Pressures on its deposit mix, with a decline in non-interest-bearing deposits, can impact net interest income margins. Increased funding costs and evolving regulatory landscapes also present challenges\n- The company faces intense competition from major financial institutions and a consolidating asset management industry, which exerts pricing pressures. Effectively managing these competitive dynamics is crucial for maintaining its market standing and profitability\n\n### Tailwinds\n- Record fee revenue, improved margins and expanded Wealth Services underpinned stronger profitability and growth positioning\n- This move aligns with the growing trend toward digital asset adoption in financial services\n- This solid foundation positioned us well to capitalize on a dynamic yet constructive market environment in 2025 and deliver another year of accelerating financial performance\n\n## 9.

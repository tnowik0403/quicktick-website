Formed in 2013 as a master limited partnership spun off from Antero Resources Corporation (AR), it converted to a C-Corp in 2019. AM owns and operates ~1,900 miles of gas gathering pipelines, two gas processing plants (total capacity ~1.6 Bcf/d), compression stations, and extensive water infrastructure including ~680 million Bbls of fresh water storage and 190 miles of water pipelines. Its services encompass natural gas gathering and compression, processing and fractionation of natural gas liquids (NGLs), NGL transportation, crude oil gathering, fresh water distribution for drilling/fracking, and wastewater treatment/disposal.\n\nRevenue is predominantly fee-based under long-term (15-year minimum) take-or-pay contracts with AR (~98% of volumes dedicated), ensuring stable cash flows largely insulated from commodity price volatility. This affiliation provides dropdown opportunities for AM to acquire AR assets. AM supports AR's ~2.8 Bcfe/d production (as of Q2 2024), emphasizing low-cost, low-emission operations. The company returned ~$325 million to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in 2023, prioritizing 1-2% annual dividend growth and debt reduction (net leverage 2.7x as of Q2 2024). With a focus on ESG (e.g., electric drive compression), AM positions itself for LNG export-driven demand growth in Appalachia.

Q2 2024); methane regulations (EPA rules finalized May 2024); pipeline constraints delaying LNG feeds. | Surging U.S. LNG exports (+10% YoY, 12 Bcf/d capacity online); Appalachia dry gas dominance (40% U.S. production); water handling demand from efficiency-focused E&Ps. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Gas Gathering & Compression**: 1,900 miles pipelines; 1.1 Bcf/d capacity; 45% electric compression.\n- **Gas Processing**: 1.6 Bcf/d at Lewistown (PA) and Hopedale (OH) plants; fractionation services.\n- **Water Services**: 680 million Bbls storage; 190 miles pipelines; wastewater treatment (high-rate disposal/recycling).\n- **Other**: Crude gathering (minor); NGL transport.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Electric Compression Expansion**: Targeting 100% fleet by 2025 (45% complete Q2 2024); reduces Scope 1 emissions 70%.\n- **Water Infrastructure**: Post-Utica acquisition (July 2024), adding centralized storage; potential AR freshwater dropdowns.\n- **No major greenfield announced**; focus on bolt-ons from AR.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~5-7% of Marcellus/Utica gas gathering/processing throughput (AR ~3% of basin production); 100% of AR's midstream needs; water services ~10-15% of AR's but expanding regionally.\n- **Forecast**: Stable-to-slight growth (1-3% annual volume growth 2025-2027) tied to AR's Utica/Marcellus inventory; water segment +10-15% CAGR through 2026 per management; potential erosion if AR slows drilling, but contracts mitigate.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric | AM | EQT Midstream (EQT-owned) | CNX Midstream (CNX-owned) | MPLX (independent) |\n|--------|----|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Market Cap** | $7.0B | N/A (internalized) | N/A (internalized) | $45B |\n| **Yield** | 6.2% | N/A | N/A | 7.8% |\n| **Leverage** | 2.7x | N/A | N/A | 3.4x |\n| **EBITDA Growth (2024E)** | Flat | N/A | N/A | +5% |\n| **Key Edge** | AR dedication | Scale in Marcellus | CNX focus | Diversified basins |\n\nAM trades at discount to peers (EV/EBITDA 10.8x vs. midstream avg. 11.5x) due to AR concentration; outperforms on water diversification.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Exclusive JV with AR (e.g., Utica water).\n- **M&A**: $195 million Utica water assets from AR (July 31, 2024); no other 2024 activity; history of ~$1B+ dropdowns.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Antero Resources (98% revenue, 2.8 Bcfe/d production).\n- **Potential Clients**: Third-party producers in Marcellus/Utica (e.g., EQT, Ascent); water services expansion.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-tier emissions (0.12 methane intensity); electric fleet leader.\n- **Management**: Aligned incentives (CEO Randy Roeder ex-AR CFO); 20+ years dividend growth.\n- **Risks**: AR credit (BBB- rated); basis differentials.\n- **Opportunities**: LNG wave (Plains/PG&E expansions 2025+); AR dropdown pipeline.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10** (Moderate Buy/Hold) – Stable dividends and water growth provide downside protection; limited upside vs. diversified peers due to AR reliance, but undervalued at 10.8x EV/EBITDA (sector avg. 11.5x). Suitable for income-focused growth portfolios with moderate risk.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $16.50 (14% upside) – Based on 11.5x 2025E EBITDA ($1.02B midpoint) + net debt; DCF implies $17-18 assuming 2% volume growth, 25% water margins.",

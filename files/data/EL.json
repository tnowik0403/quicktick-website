In 2025 rankings, Chanel overtook L'Oréal to become the world's most valuable cosmetics brand (Brand Finance). Because they do not answer to public shareholders, they can play the long game, ignoring quarterly pressures to discount or flood the market.\n\n## 11.

Improving market share trends in the U.S. and a rebound in category growth in China are supporting more consistent sales and profit growth.\n\nThe analyst expects fiscal 2026 to mark the start of a multi-year profit recovery, forecasting a 35–36% earnings compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2025 to 2028, well ahead of peers.\n\n### Financial Recovery Indicators\nThe firm highlighted cost savings and productivity gains that lifted Estee Lauder's gross margin by more than two percentage points in fiscal 2025. It expects the company to deliver roughly 500 basis points of operating margin expansion by fiscal 2028, aided by reinvestment in innovation and marketing. Despite short-term pressures, including muted guidance for fiscal 2026 sales growth of up to 3%, Goldman argued that the combination of improving fundamentals and structural industry growth should re-rate the stock.\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.2/10**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Estée Lauder receives a Buy rating of 7.2/10 for a growth-oriented portfolio with moderate risk appetite. The company appears to be at an inflection point, having likely reached its earnings trough in fiscal 2025. Key positive factors include:\n\n- Strong execution of the \"Beauty Reimagined\" strategy showing early results\n- Organic sales growth returning (+3% in Q1 2026) after three years of decline  \n- Market share gains in key regions (U.S., China, Japan)\n- Significant margin expansion potential (500 basis points by fiscal 2028)\n- Trading below historical valuations despite improving fundamentals\n- Strong brand portfolio in resilient prestige beauty market\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $125-130**\n\nGiven the company's improving fundamentals, margin expansion trajectory, and structural industry growth, a fair value range of $125-130 appears reasonable for investors seeking growth upside with moderate risk tolerance. This represents approximately 8-13% upside from current levels and aligns with recent analyst upgrades from major investment banks.",

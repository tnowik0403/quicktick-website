Near-term headwinds (China, inventory) outweigh recovery visibility despite PRGP and prestige tailwinds. Stock -40% YTD reflects risks; oversold but FY2025 EPS trough limits upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $105 (30% upside from $80.45). DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal, +4% CAGR post-2026) for strong growth portfolio/moderate risk; assumes PRGP delivers 500bps margin expansion by FY2027, China stabilization. Consensus target $102 (per Yahoo, 25 analysts).",

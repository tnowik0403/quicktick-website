Founded in 1929 and headquartered in Davidson, NC, the company operates through three main segments: Aerospace & Industrial (44% of 2023 sales), Defense Electronics (35%), and Naval & Power (21%). \n\nIn Aerospace & Industrial, CW designs and manufactures surface and underwater technologies, including actuation systems, pumps, valves, and sensors for commercial aerospace (e.g., Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo), industrial machinery, and power generation. Defense Electronics focuses on embedded computing, mission-critical electronics, and data acquisition for military platforms like the F-35 fighter jet and ground vehicles. Naval & Power supplies nuclear propulsion components, valves, and control systems for U.S. Navy submarines (e.g., Virginia-class, Columbia-class) and commercial nuclear reactors.\n\nWith ~9,000 employees and operations in 20+ countries, CW benefits from long-term contracts, high barriers to entry due to ITAR regulations, and a backlog exceeding $3 billion (as of Q2 2024). The company emphasizes innovation in electrification, hypersonics, and digital twins, positioning it as a key enabler in high-reliability mission-critical applications. FY2023 revenue was $2.86 billion (up 13% YoY), with adjusted EPS of $9.98. CW's resilience stems from its defense-heavy portfolio (~60% of sales), buffering cyclical commercial exposures.

Founded in 1880 and headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, the company operates through two main segments: Beverage Packaging (global leader in aluminum cans for beer, spirits, carbonated soft drinks, and energy drinks) and Aerospace (precision-engineered components for satellites, aircraft, and defense systems via Ball Aerospace, rebranded as BAE Systems' Space & Mission Systems after a $5.6B sale in Feb 2024). \n\nBeverage Packaging, which accounts for ~90% of revenue, serves major clients across North & Central America (BP NCA), Europe, Middle East & Africa (BP EMEA), and South America (BP SA). The company benefits from aluminum's recyclability (75% recycled content in cans), lightweight design reducing shipping costs, and consumer shift toward sustainable packaging amid plastic bans and ESG pressures. In FY2023, it produced ~180 billion cans globally. Aerospace provides high-margin, stable revenue from U.S. government contracts (NASA, DoD). Ball's strategy focuses on volume growth via premium/specialty cans (e.g., sleek, sustainable formats), cost efficiencies, and capacity expansions. Recent challenges include volatile aluminum prices and soft beverage volumes, but tailwinds from premiumization and aluminum's edge over steel/plastic persist.

Company Overview\n\nBall Corporation is an American aluminum manufacturing company headquartered in Westminster, Colorado. It is best known for its early production of glass jars, lids, and related products used for home canning. It eventually became the world's largest manufacturer of recyclable aluminum packaging for a variety of beverage, home and personal care applications. Ball Corporation employs 16,000 people worldwide and reported 2024 net sales of $11.80 billion, which excludes the divested aerospace business. \n\nBall Corporation supplies innovative, sustainable aluminum packaging solutions for beverage, personal care and household product customers. The company manufactures aluminum beverage containers for carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks, and other beverages, as well as extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles, aluminum cups, and aluminum slugs. In 2024, Ball Corporation left the aerospace business after selling Ball Aerospace to BAE Systems Inc. for $5.6 billion in cash. The move was strategic in allowing Ball to increase its focus on \"low-carbon, best-value aluminum packaging initiatives\", said CEO Dan Fisher at the time.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe current Ball(BALL) stock price is $56.08, with a market capitalization of 15.03B. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.98 and offers a dividend yield of 1.4%. In the last year, Ball(BALL) shares hit a 52-week high of $60.29 and a 52-week low of $43.51. According to 13 analysts, the average rating for BALL stock is \"Buy.\" The 12-month stock price target is $61.75, which is an increase of 16.16% from the latest price.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nBall Corporation operates primarily in aluminum packaging with three main business segments:\n\n• **Beverage Packaging North and Central America** - The North and Central American aluminum beverage market, encompassing the United States, Canada, and Mexico, accounts for 48% of Ball's revenue. This North American aluminum beverage market totaled approximately 138 billion units in 2024. Ball is the largest producer in this region, shipping roughly 48 billion cans and capturing a 34% market share.\n\n• **Beverage Packaging EMEA** - Ball's EMEA aluminum beverage can market stretches across Europe, Egypt, and Turkey. These facilities shipped 36 billion aluminum beverage cans in 2024, accounting for 29% of Ball's revenue. The total EMEA aluminum market for that year amounted to 93 billion, which implies that Ball held a share of 36%, making it the largest player.\n\n• **Beverage Packaging South America** - Its South American region represented 17% of revenue in 2024. The company shipped 19 billion units during the year, capturing 45% of the region's 43 billion unit market and maintaining its position as the largest supplier.\n\n• **Aerosol Packaging** - Beyond beverage cans, Ball also manufactures aluminum aerosol packaging, operating six dedicated plants and two slug facilities. Beauty and personal care represent over 80% of volumes, with global demand around 7 billion units. Ball holds share across regions—23% in Europe (~4 billion units), 27% in North America (~1.5 billion units), and 25% in Brazil (~0.9 billion units)—supplying major consumer goods companies including Unilever, L'Oréal, Procter &\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nBall Corporation has several strategic initiatives underway:\n\n• **Oregon Plant Expansion** - Capacity Expansion: The new Millersburg, Oregon plant is on track for second-half 2026, unlocking further volume and margin improvement by 2027.\n\n• **Florida Can Manufacturing Acquisition** - Acquisition of Florida Can Manufacturing for $160 million in February 2025.\n\n• **Benepack Acquisition** - Ball Corporation (NYSE: BALL) today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire a majority stake in Benepack's beverage can manufacturing businesses in Europe consisting of its two production facilities in Belgium and Hungary.

The transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n• **Aluminum Cup Joint Venture** - Ball Corporation announced today the closing of a 49:51 joint venture with Ayna.AI (Ayna), a leading strategic advisory and implementation firm in the industrial technology space. This strategic venture will accelerate the continued development and growth of the Aluminum Cup category. The newly formed joint venture will be named Oasis Venture Holdings, LLC, and will consist of the Aluminum Cup business, including its commercial, supply chain and manufacturing teams and the plant in Rome, Georgia.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nOperational excellence program is ahead of schedule, aiming for $500 million in savings by 2026. Growth strategies focus on North America, Europe, and Latin America with regional expansion plans. We committed to a $500 million productivity target over a four-year period, 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. The good news is we will deliver that a year early by the end of 2026.\n\n**Regional Growth Forecasts:**\n- The company anticipates significant growth in key regions, with a forecast of 6-8% growth in South America and mid-single-digit percentage increases in Europe for 2025. North America is expected to achieve approximately 1% volume growth.\n- Growth forecasts: 1%-3% North America, 3%-5% Europe, 4%-6% South America.\n\n**Strategic Pillars:**\n- Four strategic pillars: execution, customer proximity, leveraging aluminum packaging, and agility in a volatile world.\n- Financial targets include 2%-3% enterprise growth, operating earnings growing at twice sales, 10%-15% EPS growth, and maximizing free cash flow.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nBall serves major global beverage brands across its regions:\n\n**North America:** The region is heavily weighted toward carbonated soft drinks and energy beverages, with major customers including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Red Bull, Monster Beverage, Celsius, and Constellation Brands.\n\n**EMEA:** Key customers include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Carlsberg, Heineken, Red Bull, and Molson Coors.\n\n**South America:** Major customers in the region include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, and CCU.\n\n**Growing Customer Segments:** The Poppis of the world, the Liquid Deaths ... they're large in our portfolio. Still, if Ball's large customers — which include the likes of Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch — are not growing, you can have all of the startups in the world, and you're just not going to move the needle on the size of volume.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Ball's third quarter 2025 comparable net earnings were $277 million, or $1.02 per diluted share compared to $278 million, or 91 cents per diluted share in 2024.\n- Revenue: 3.38 billion dollars, up from the forecasted 3.31 billion dollars. Ball Corporation's earnings per share of $1.02 met analyst expectations, resulting in no EPS surprise. However, the company exceeded revenue forecasts by 2.11%, achieving 3.38 billion dollars.\n\n**Annual Performance:**\n- In 2024, Ball Corporation's revenue was $11.80 billion, a decrease of -2.21% compared to the previous year's $12.06 billion. Earnings were $4.01 billion, an increase of 466.90%.\n\n**Financial Health Metrics:**\n- Ball Corporation's current ratio is 1, and the quick ratio is 0.67, suggesting a need for improved liquidity management. The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.35, reflecting a relatively high level of leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 2.31 places the company in the grey area, indicating some financial stress.\n\n**Shareholder Returns:**\n- The company also returned 1.35 billion dollars to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, underscoring its commitment to enhancing shareholder value.\n- The company returned $612 million to shareholders in Q1 2025 through share repurchases and dividends, positioning itself to exceed its $1.5 billion annual target.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The group holds a strong position in the food and beverage packaging industry, a market projected to grow from $363.8 billion in 2022 to $512 billion by 2028, fueled by rising demand for sustainable and recyclable materials, stricter regulations on plastics, and consumer shifts toward convenience formats such as ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve packaging. Aluminum cans, with recycling rates above 70% globally and near 75% in Europe, are well-positioned to capture share from PET and glass.\n- Europe: Growth driven by substrate shift from plastic/glass to cans, with sustainability as a strong tailwind.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- A 50% U.S. tariff on imported aluminum, effective June 2025, directly impacts Ball, as aluminum constitutes about 40% of its production costs. This could compress margins if costs aren't passed on.\n- Weakness in the alcohol sector, representing over 30% of its business, poses a risk, with potential deceleration into 2026.\n- Ball's reliance on a handful of major customers like Coca-Cola, AB InBev, and PepsiCo leaves it vulnerable if demand shifts, while heavy exposure to aluminum cans heightens competition with PET and glass. Regional overcapacity and rising input costs further pressure margins, especially where price pass-through is limited.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nBall Corporation holds dominant positions across its key markets:\n\n• **Global Market Position:** Ball is the world's largest metal can manufacturer with market share over 30% in its three main regions (North America, Europe, and South America).\n\n• **North America:** Ball is the largest producer in this region, shipping roughly 48 billion cans and capturing a 34% market share.\n\n• **EMEA:** Ball held a share of 36%, making it the largest player.\n\n• **South America:** capturing 45% of the region's 43 billion unit market and maintaining its position as the largest supplier.\n\n• **Aerosol Packaging:** Ball holds share across regions—23% in Europe (~4 billion units), 27% in North America (~1.5 billion units), and 25% in Brazil (~0.9 billion units)\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nBall faces competition from several major players:\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- Crown Holdings is a global packaging company with a broad portfolio, including beverage cans, food cans, and aerosol cans. They challenge Ball Corp through their extensive global network. Crown Holdings' revenue in 2023 was approximately $11.6 billion.\n- Ardagh Group also competes directly in the beverage can market. They have a strong European presence and focus on sustainable packaging solutions. Ardagh's revenue in 2023 was around $5.0 billion.\n- Ball competes with other large, multi-continent players such as Crown Holdings, Ardagh Group, and Canpack, but also smaller regional manufacturers.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Ball is the world's largest producer of aluminum beverage cans. Used primarily for carbonated soft drinks and beer, aluminum cans are historically a low-growth industry but one with favorable competitive dynamics for incumbents.\n- Ball Packaging's global reach and long-standing relationships with key beverage companies solidify its market share and customer loyalty.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity:**\n\n• **Benepack Acquisition (December 2025):** Ball Corporation announced that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire a majority stake in Benepack's beverage can manufacturing businesses in Europe consisting of its two production facilities in Belgium and Hungary.

This acquisition includes manufacturing facilities in Spain and Belgium. It allows the company to meet increasing demand for sustainable packaging across Europe and expand into new categories.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Changes (November 2025):** In a significant leadership change, Ronald J. Lewis has been appointed as the new CEO, replacing Daniel W. Fisher. The company clarified that Fisher's departure was not due to any disagreement with the company.\n\n**Credit Facilities Refinancing:** Ball Corporation completed the refinancing of $3.5 billion in senior secured credit facilities, which are set to mature in 2030.\n\n**Strong Q3 2025 Performance:** Ball delivered strong third-quarter results, returning over $1 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2025. Our solid financial position, streamlined operating model, and disciplined growth strategy drove higher volumes and operating earnings. As we look to close out the year, we remain vigilant given ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility, but our team is well-positioned to execute and achieve our 2025 objectives.\n\n**Sustainability Progress:** In 2024, Ball achieved global renewable electricity coverage of 73%, a 13 percentage points increase versus the previous year.

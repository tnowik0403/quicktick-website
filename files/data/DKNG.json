Looking to 2026, management highlighted incremental upside from its upcoming launch of DraftKings Predictions, allowing entry into states that still lack online sports betting.

Missouri becomes the 29th U.S. state where DraftKings offers sports wagering, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Ontario, Canada.\n\n**Predictive Markets Entry**: DraftKings (DKNG) has embarked on a transformative journey into the prediction markets sector, signaling a bold repositioning of its business model. By acquiring Railbird, a federally regulated prediction market platform, DraftKings is not only diversifying its revenue streams but also leveraging regulatory momentum to cement its leadership in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\n**International Expansion**: DraftKings will expand towards Canada, Latin America, and Europe so this is also a way to increase the revenue of this company with advanced technology like blockchain-based betting.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\nDraftKings' client base consists primarily of individual consumers rather than institutional clients. Monthly Unique Payers (\"MUPs\") increased to 3.6 million average monthly unique paying customers in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 55% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nKey partnership relationships include:\n- **Sports Leagues**: Exclusive partnerships with the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL, allowing DraftKings to leverage league branding and promotions.\n- **Media Partners**: DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) has secured a landmark multi-year advertising agreement with NBCUniversal for exclusive integrations and digital sponsorships across NBC's sports properties. The partnership encompasses major sports coverage including NFL, NBA, NCAA, PGA Tour, Premier League, and more. The deal will leverage NBCUniversal's reach across linear, streaming, and digital platforms, covering major events like Super Bowl LX, NBA All-Star Weekend, and the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup on Telemundo.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n**Revenue Growth**: As of September 30, 2024, the company reported total revenue of $3,374.9 million for the nine months ending, a 38.6% increase from $2,434.5 million in the same period in 2023. The online gaming segment alone generated $3,323.7 million, reflecting a growth of 41.2% year-over-year.\n\n**Q3 2024 Performance**: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, DraftKings reported revenue of $1,095 million, an increase of $306 million, or 39%, compared to $790 million during the same period in 2023.\n\n**2025 Guidance**: DraftKings is introducing a fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, which equates to approximately 31% year-over-year growth based on the midpoints of the Company's updated fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range and the Company's fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance range. DraftKings continues to expect fiscal year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $900 million to $1.0 billion.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**: On July 30, 2024, DraftKings' Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's Class A common stock.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n**Headwinds**:\n- **Tax Pressures**: The company is facing over $100 million in gross EBITDA headwinds due to tax changes in states like Colorado, Maryland, and Illinois. The company is facing over $100 million in gross EBITDA headwinds due to tax changes in states like Colorado, Maryland, and Illinois. These tax increases could potentially raise DraftKings' effective tax rate from approximately 35% to over 50% in some markets.\n- **Customer-Friendly Sports Outcomes**: Part of the problem boils down to another bout with bettor-friendly outcomes on the NFL, a scenario that plagued DraftKings and its peers during the 2024 football season. For example, favorites won at an 82% rate during the NCAA Tournament, also known as March Madness, earlier this year. That's bad for companies like DraftKings because recreational bettors -- DraftKings' core clientele -- typically wager on favorites more than underdogs.\n- **Competition**: DraftKings operates in a highly competitive environment, with established rivals like FanDuel and emerging players constantly vying for market share. The company has already experienced some erosion in its iGaming market share, losing approximately 300 basis points to smaller companies from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025. Maintaining and growing market share becomes increasingly challenging as the industry matures and customer acquisition costs rise.\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n- **Market Expansion**: Currently many states of the United States have prevented sports betting but if the other states also allow this then this will be an opportunity for DraftKings. According to the various factors, the betting industry will reach 180 billion dollars in the year 2030.\n- **Product Innovation**: DraftKings continues to improve its sportsbook net revenue margin through a higher parlay mix and more efficient promotions while maintaining high customer retention.\n- **Strategic Partnerships**: Partnerships with ESPN and NBCUniversal and the rollout of Spanish-language capabilities are expected to deepen engagement and expand DraftKings' addressable market.\n\n## 9.

This superiority in unit economics is the property of its dominance; \"The Flutter Edge\" risk-trading platform enabled it to provide its clients with competitive pricing and higher structural hold rates than its competitors.\n\n**Customer Acquisition**: S&P identified that DraftKings has a structurally higher customer acquisition cost, totaling a 3-year payback period compared to Flutter's 18 months.\n\n## 11.

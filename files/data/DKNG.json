(DKNG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $38.45\n- **Market Capitalization**: $19.22 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $25.73 - $49.57\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 11.5 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nDraftKings Inc. (DKNG) is a leading digital sports entertainment and gaming company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 2012 as a daily fantasy sports (DFS) platform, it pivoted to sports betting following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2018 PASPA repeal, which legalized sports wagering in most states. Today, DraftKings operates as a premier online sportsbook and iGaming (casino) provider across 25+ U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Ontario, Canada. Its ecosystem includes mobile apps for sports betting, DFS contests, online casino games, and free-to-play games, generating revenue primarily from handle (total wagers), with a focus on Same Game Parlays (SGPs), live betting, and promotions.\n\nThe company went public in April 2020 via a SPAC merger with Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. As of Q2 2024, DraftKings holds a top market position in U.S. online sports betting (~27% share) and iGaming (~20%), driven by tech innovations like AI-powered personalization and odds boosts. It reported record revenue of $1.391 billion in Q2 2024 (up 27% YoY), with Gross Gaming Profit (GGP) margins expanding to 40.4%. Expansion into new markets, product diversification (e.g., lottery via Jackpocket acquisition), and profitability inflection (first positive Adj. EBITDA of $104 million in Q2) position it for scalable growth amid a $150B+ U.S. addressable market projected to reach $45B in sports betting revenue by 2025 (per Global Market Insights). Challenges include regulatory hurdles and competition, but DraftKings' 14 million+ monthly unique players and sticky user base underscore its moat.

(HIPO) is a technology-driven property and casualty (P&C) insurer specializing in homeowners insurance. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Hippo uses proprietary data science, telematics, and smart home devices to underwrite policies more accurately, offer instant quotes, and streamline claims.

In 2023, it generated $378 million in revenue, with ~90,000 policies in force. Hippo went public via SPAC merger in November 2021 at ~$10/share.

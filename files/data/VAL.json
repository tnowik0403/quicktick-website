Spun off from Danaher Corporation on October 2, 2023, Veralto operates primarily through two complementary businesses: **Hach** (Water Quality segment, ~75% of revenue), which provides analytical instruments, software, consumables, and services for water testing in labs, field operations, and process environments; and **ChemTreat** (Industrial & Municipal Solutions segment, ~25% of revenue), which offers customized chemical treatments, automation, and engineering services to optimize industrial water systems and prevent issues like scaling and corrosion.\n\nHeadquartered in Westminster, Colorado, Veralto serves over 100,000 customers worldwide across sectors including utilities, food & beverage, power generation, pharmaceuticals, and microelectronics. With ~8,000 employees and operations in 150+ countries, the company emphasizes recurring revenue streams (60%+ from consumables/services), high margins (EBITDA ~28%), and mission-critical applications driven by stringent regulations (e.g., EPA standards). FY2023 pro forma revenue was $2.90 billion, with a focus on digital transformation via SaaS platforms like Hach's Claros software for real-time water intelligence. Veralto benefits from secular tailwinds like water scarcity, aging infrastructure, and ESG mandates, positioning it as a \"picks and shovels\" play in the $100B+ global water market.

Founded in 1984, CDW operates primarily in the U.S. (80%+ revenue), with growing footprints in the UK and Canada. It serves over 250,000 customers annually, positioning itself as a \"one-stop shop\" for IT modernization, emphasizing cloud migration, cybersecurity, AI-driven solutions, and managed services. In FY2025 (ended Dec 31, 2025), CDW reported trailing 12-month revenue of $22.6 billion (Q3 2025 earnings, Oct 30, 2025), with services growing 12% YoY to represent 28% of total revenue. Gross margins stood at 19.8% (Q3 2025), driven by higher-margin services amid PC refresh cycles and AI infrastructure demand. The company benefits from a vast vendor ecosystem (e.g., partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, Cisco) and a direct sales force of 3,000+ reps. Recent analyst buzz (Seeking Alpha, Dec 2025) highlights CDW's resilience in a softening hardware market, with AI tailwinds projected to fuel 8-10% CAGR through 2028. Challenges include macroeconomic caution from SMB clients, but CDW's 95%+ customer retention and $2.5B+ services backlog underscore its sticky, recurring revenue model.

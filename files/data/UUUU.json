UUUU's Value Score of F suggests that the stock is not so cheap and has a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Uranium Production\nEnergy Fuels has more licensed and operational uranium production capacity than any other U.S. miner. Energy Fuels holds more in-ground uranium resources than any other US producer. Energy Fuels is the only conventional uranium producer in America. We take great pride in our uranium mining, as well as owning and operating a mill, and conventional mines that can produce up to 8 million pounds of uranium per year.\n\n### Rare Earth Elements (REE)\nIn 2025, Energy Fuels commenced producing rare earth element oxides at its White Mesa Mill at pilot scale. It is currently partnered with North Carolina-based rare earth magnet manufacturer Vulcan Elements. Energy Fuels started producing mixed REE carbonate from uranium and REE-bearing materials acquired from third parties, at a commercial scale from the White Mesa Mill in 2022. It began producing separated neodymium/praseodymium (NdPr) at a commercial scale at the mill in 2024.\n\n### Heavy Mineral Sands (HMS)\nIt produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, carbonate, and heavy mineral sands, such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite. The Company also owns the operating Kwale HMS project in Kenya, which ceased mining and commenced final reclamation activities at the end of 2024.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Rare Earth Expansion\nThe Company is currently in the process of updating the White Mesa Mill's AACE International (\"AACE\") Class 4 Pre-Feasibility Study originally released in Q2-2024 to increase throughput to a total of 60,000 tpa of monazite, producing roughly 6,000 tpa of NdPr, 150 to 225 tpa of Dy, and 50 to 75 tpa of Tb.\n\n### Heavy Rare Earth Elements\nIn August, UUUU produced its first kilogram of dysprosium (Dy) oxide at 99.9% purity, surpassing commercial benchmarks. Energy Fuels plans to construct and commission commercial-scale Dy, Tb and potentially samarium separation capacity at the White Mesa Mill, which could be operational by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n### Medical Isotopes\nAt the Mill, the Company also produces advanced REE products, vanadium oxide (when market conditions warrant), and is preparing to begin pilot-scale testing of certain medical isotopes from existing uranium process streams needed for emerging cancer treatments. On August 19, 2024, the Company announced it acquired RadTran LLC (\"RadTran\"), a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. RadTran's expertise includes separation of radium-226 (\"Ra-226\") and radium-228 (\"Ra-228\") from uranium and thorium process streams. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance Energy Fuels' planned capabilities to address the global shortage of these essential isotopes used in emerging targeted alpha therapies (\"TAT\") for cancer treatment.\n\n### Heavy Mineral Sands Projects\nThe Company is developing three (3) additional HMS projects: the Toliara Project in Madagascar; the Bahia Project in Brazil; and the Donald Project in Australia in which the Company has the right to earn up to a 49% interest in a joint venture with Astron Corporation Limited.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n\"2024 was a fundamental building year for Energy Fuels, as we resumed U.S. uranium mining, realized profitable uranium sales, achieved commercial U.S. rare earth production, and secured two 'Tier 1' critical mineral projects in allied nations, which upon development, are expected to be able to provide low-cost rare earth feedstocks to our U.S. processing plant, while supporting additional stability, growth, and revenues for decades\" said Mark Chalmers, Energy Fuels' President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe company's vertical integration strategy extends from mining through final product separation. The White Mesa Mill can process multiple feed sources, including uranium ore from owned mines and rare earth concentrates from various projects. This operational flexibility allows for campaign-based production, switching between uranium and rare earth processing based on market conditions and feed availability.\n\nTaking current production levels and its development pipeline into account, the company has the potential to produce 4-6 million pounds of uranium per year.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nEnergy Fuels has four long-term contracts with major U.S. nuclear utilities that require deliveries of base quantities of 2.8 million pounds of uranium through 2030. The company recently announced that its high-purity NdPr oxide has been manufactured into commercial-scale rare-earth permanent magnets (REPMs) and approved for use in high-temperature drive unit motors that are installed in EV and hybrid vehicles.\n\nIn December 2025, Energy Fuels announced that its high-purity Dy oxide met all standards of a major South Korean automotive manufacturer for downstream rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production. This follows the earlier qualification of its NdPr oxide (another key ingredient in REPMs) for use in NdFeB magnet applications. This makes Energy Fuels the first U.S. company to have both its \"light\" and \"heavy\" REEs qualified for use in permanent magnet applications, a milestone in rebuilding the U.S. rare earth supply chain.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### 2024 Full Year Results\nIn 2024, Energy Fuels Inc. reported a notable increase in revenue to 78.1M, compared to 37.9M in 2023, indicating a strong upward trend. The company generated $78.11 million in revenue but recorded a net loss of $47.84 million ($0.28 per share), primarily due to acquisition-related costs and operating expenses.\n\nOperational highlights include uranium sales of 450,000 pounds, achieving a 56% gross margin, and heavy mineral sands sales generating $39.87 million. The company successfully commissioned its Phase 1 REE separation circuit, producing 38,000 kg of NdPr.\n\n### 2025 Performance Update\nUUUU recently announced that it mined more than 1.6 million pounds of uranium from its Pinyon Plain, La Sal and Pandora mines in 2025, topping the higher end of its prior stated target of 0.875-1.435 million pounds by a margin of 11%. The White Mesa Mill in Utah has processed more than 1 million pounds of finished uranium in the year.\n\nThe company indicated that uranium sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 will be around 360,000 pounds, reflecting a 50% sequential rise. With a weighted average sales price of $74.93 per pound, gross uranium sales revenues for the quarter are expected to be $27 million.\n\n### Financial Position\nEnergy Fuels ended the third quarter of 2025 with $298.5 million of working capital, including $94 million of cash and cash equivalents. The company maintains a debt-free balance sheet.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n### Uranium Market\nFrom 2018 to 2023, the company contributed more than half the US uranium production, having produced two-thirds of all uranium in the United States since 2017. In the U.S. uranium market, Energy Fuels is the leader in conventional milling, while competitors focus on in-situ recovery (ISR) methods. Globally, it remains a small-scale producer but holds a unique strategic position due to its asset base.\n\n### Rare Earth Elements\nThe rare earth elements market has become a critical national security issue, with China controlling approximately 80% of global supply chains. Energy Fuels has strategically positioned itself to address this dependency through both light and heavy rare earth production capabilities. The company has already achieved commercial production of NDPR oxide and is advancing heavy rare earth separation of dysprosium and terbium.\n\nThis makes Energy Fuels the first U.S. company to have both its \"light\" and \"heavy\" REEs qualified for use in permanent magnet applications, marking a notable milestone in rebuilding the U.S. rare earth supply chain.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Uranium Competitors\nEnergy Fuels UUUU and Uranium Energy UEC are U.S.-based uranium companies aiming to capitalize on the increasing demand for uranium driven by the global shift toward nuclear energy as a clean power source. UUUU, with a market capitalization of $4.8 billion, is a leading U.S. producer of natural uranium concentrate and an emerging rare earth elements (REEs) player. Uranium Energy, valued at $7.2 billion, recently restarted production at its Wyoming hub and spoke In-Situ Recovery (\"ISR\") platform.\n\nEnergy Fuels offers a unique dual exposure to uranium and rare earth elements, providing leverage to two fast-growing strategic markets. With a cheaper valuation, rising analyst estimates, a clear path to profitability by 2026 and an established production profile, UUUU stands out as the superior long-term play. UEC has seen downward estimate revisions and is expected to incur a loss in 2026 due to higher operating costs.\n\n### Rare Earth Competitors\nMP Materials MP and Energy Fuels UUUU are two US-based companies expected to play important roles in America's efforts to establish a secure domestic supply chain for rare earth elements (REEs) and other critical minerals. Las Vegas, NV-based MP Materials is the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere with a market capitalization of $9.6 billion. It operates the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility, the only rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America.\n\nThis operational focus has enabled Energy Fuels to achieve commercial production while competitors remain in development phases. With over $2 billion in market capitalization and approximately $250 million in working capital, Energy Fuels has the financial foundation to execute its ambitious critical minerals strategy. The company trades as both a uranium and rare earth stock, reflecting its unique dual-commodity positioning in markets experiencing structural supply deficits.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Base Resources Acquisition (2024)\nOn October 2, 2024, the Company announced it completed its previously announced acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Base Resources Ltd. (\"Base Resources\"), which is expected to transform the Company into a global leader in critical minerals production, including HMS (titanium and zirconium), REEs and uranium.\n\nEnergy Fuels UUUU has acquired Base Resources Limited in exchange for the issuance of its shares totaling $178.4 million in value. The acquisition adds Base Resources' Toliara Mineral Sand Project to UUUU's portfolio, complementing its Bahia Mineral Sand Project in Brazil. These assets, combined with Energy Fuel's 49% interest in the joint venture to develop the Donald Mineral Sand Project in Australia, will position it as a major producer of rare earth elements (REE), titanium and zirconium. This marks Energy Fuels' effort to diversify its business by expanding its REE production capabilities while maintaining its leadership in uranium.\n\n### RadTran LLC Acquisition\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company announced it acquired RadTran LLC (\"RadTran\"), a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance Energy Fuels' planned capabilities to address the global shortage of these essential isotopes used in emerging targeted alpha therapies (\"TAT\") for cancer treatment.\n\n### Donald Project Joint Venture\nEnergy Fuels (NYSE:UUUU) and Astron (ASX:ATR) received a conditional, non-binding Letter of Support from Export Finance Australia dated 21 October 2025 for up to A$80 million of senior debt toward the Donald Rare Earth and Mineral Sands Project.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Navajo Nation Agreement (January 2025)\nEnergy Fuels Inc. and the Navajo Nation, the largest indigenous tribe in the U.S., today announced the signing of a landmark agreement governing the transport of uranium ore along federal and state highways crossing the Navajo Nation. Ore transport from Energy Fuels' Pinyon Plain Mine in northern Arizona to the company's White Mesa Mill in southern Utah is now expected to resume in February 2025.\n\nAdditionally, the company has committed to accepting and transporting, at no cost to the Nation, up to 10,000 tons of uranium-bearing cleanup materials from abandoned uranium mines within the Navajo Nation, which are primarily an unfortunate relic of old U.S. government uranium programs that began in the 1940s, in which Energy Fuels had no involvement. The company has also committed to make further contributions to support the Nation's transportation safety programs, education, the environment, public health and welfare, and local economic development on the Navajo Nation relating to uranium matters.\n\n### Vara Mada (Toliara) Feasibility Study (January 2026)\nEnergy Fuels Inc. today released the results of its updated Feasibility Study (FS) for its 100%-owned Vara Mada project in Madagascar (formerly known as the Toliara Project). The FS confirms the project's exceptional economics, its world class quantities of high-quality rare earth, titanium, and zircon Mineral Reserves and Resources, and an initially modeled 38-year mine life which the Company expects to be significantly expanded with planned refinements to the mine plan and additional drilling.\n\n$1.8 billion NPV (10% discount rate, post-tax, pre-debt (real), post final investment decision (FID)). $7.30 per share NPV (10% discount rate, post-tax, pre-debt (real), post FID), based on current outstanding shares.\n\n### Rare Earth Qualification Success\nIn December 2025, Energy Fuels announced that its high-purity Dy oxide met all standards of a major South Korean automotive manufacturer for downstream rare earth permanent magnet (REPM) production. This follows the earlier qualification of its NdPr oxide (another key ingredient in REPMs) for use in NdFeB magnet applications. This makes Energy Fuels the first U.S. company to have both its \"light\" and \"heavy\" REEs qualified for use in permanent magnet applications, a milestone in rebuilding the U.S. rare earth supply chain.\n\n### Proposed Convertible Notes Offering\nEnergy Fuels (NYSE:UUUU) has announced a proposed private placement of $550 million Convertible Senior Notes due 2031, with an option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $82.5 million in notes. The notes will be convertible into cash, common shares, or a combination of both at Energy Fuels' discretion. The company plans to use the proceeds to fund capped call transactions, expand its Phase 2 rare earth separations circuit at the White Mesa Mill, develop the Donald heavy mineral sands and rare earth project in Australia, and support general corporate needs.\n\n## 12.

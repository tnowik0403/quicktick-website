Non-performing loans up to 0.84% (Q3). | Strong deposit beta control (cost of deposits 2.45%); CET1 buffer (10.8%) supports growth. Equipment finance NIM >5%. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Fed rate cuts (50bps Sep 18, 2024) risk NIM compression; regional bank CRE stress (office vacancies ~20% in Midwest). Regulatory scrutiny post-SVB. | Expected 25bps cuts Nov/Dec 2024 easing funding costs; Midwest economic resilience (unemployment 4.1% IN/MI). Loan demand rebound in C&I. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Deposits**: 55% non-interest bearing; core deposits 88% of total.\n- **Loans**: CRE (45%), C&I (25%), residential (20%), consumer/equipment (10%).\n- **Fee-Based**: Wealth management ($1.2B AUM), brokerage, insurance agency.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Digital Lending Platform (Q4 2024 rollout)**: AI-driven SMB loan origination to cut approval times 50%.\n- **Equipment Finance Expansion**: Post-Jul 2023 BankFirst acquisition, targeting $200M portfolio growth by YE 2025.\n- **Sustainable Lending Initiative (Announced Aug 2024)**: Green loans for solar/agri projects, $50M pipeline.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- Indiana community banking: ~0.8% statewide deposits (per FDIC Q2 2024); top-10 in north-central IN (~5% local).\n- Michigan SW: ~1.2% deposits.\n- Niche: Equipment finance ~2% Midwest small-ticket market.\n\n## Market Share Forecast\n- **Growth Projection**: +10-15% deposits/3yrs via digital/branch expansion; equipment finance share to 3-4% with acquisitions. Stable overall amid sector consolidation (regional banks losing 1-2% to nationals).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q3 2024 or Latest) | HBNC | Old National (ONB) | Fifth Third (FITB) | 1st Source (SRCE) |\n|----------------------------|------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| **Assets ($B)** | 6.1 | 50.2 | 213 | 8.9 |\n| **NIM (%)** | 3.32 | 3.28 | 3.08 | 3.55 |\n| **ROTE (%)** | 8.2 | 9.1 | 9.5 | 12.3 |\n| **CET1 (%)** | 10.8 | 10.2 | 10.7 | 11.5 |\n| **P/TB Ratio** | 1.35x | 1.15x | 1.40x | 2.10x |\n| **Edge** | Dividend yield, local focus | Scale, M&A | National reach | Premium valuation |\n\nHBNC trades at discount to peers on TBV due to CRE but offers yield advantage.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Fiserv for core processing; Black Knight for mortgage tech.\n- **M&A**: Acquired BankFirst (Jul 2023, $45M, added equipment finance); monitoring tuck-ins in OH/IN (CEO comments Q3 call).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Local manufacturers (e.g., auto suppliers), municipalities (10% loans), healthcare (e.g., Community Health Network exposure).\n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding to Chicago tech firms; green energy developers.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\"); low carbon lending focus.\n- **Management**: CEO Jim Owsianik (since 2022) emphasized de-risking CRE in Q3 call.\n- **Risks**: 35% loans in office/industrial CRE; deposit outflows if rates drop sharply.\n- **Opportunities**: M&A appeal (1.2x TBV attractive); Midwest migration trends.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Moderate Buy)** – Hold core position; add on dips. Strong dividend, balance sheet resilience support upside in rate-cut cycle, but CRE caps aggressive growth. Outperforms sector avg (XRB +5% YTD vs HBNC +45%).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $19.50 (28% upside). Based on 1.7x 2025E TBV ($11.50/share) + 10% ROE perpetuity DCF, assuming NIM expansion to 3.50% and 4% loan growth (per analyst consensus from Seeking Alpha/Barchart, Oct 2024).

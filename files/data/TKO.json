However, the current valuation at 72.5x P/E appears stretched relative to peers. The stock offers strong growth potential for investors with moderate risk appetite, particularly on any pullbacks toward the $185-195 range where risk-adjusted returns become more attractive. The combination of UFC and WWE creates a unique entertainment portfolio with significant barriers to entry and global monetization opportunities.",

(BODI) is a leading subscription-based digital fitness and nutrition platform, offering streaming workout programs, nutritional supplements, and connected fitness equipment primarily through direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels.

Post-2021 SPAC merger (via Forest Road Acquisition Corp.), BODI expanded into a multi-platform ecosystem including Beachbody on Demand (rebranded BODi app in 2022), Shakeology meal replacement shakes, and Myx connected bikes (acquired 2021). The BODi app delivers 3,000+ on-demand workouts across strength, cardio, yoga, and dance, bundled with nutrition coaching via its \"Majors\" small-group accountability model. BODI targets health-conscious consumers aged 25-55, emphasizing sustainable lifestyle changes over gym memberships. With ~563,000 digital subscribers (Q2 2024), it operates in the $30B+ U.S. digital fitness/nutrition market, competing via proven content IP and high retention (60%+ annually).

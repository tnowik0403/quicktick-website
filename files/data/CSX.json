The company transports a diverse mix of commodities, including intermodal containers (35% of volume), merchandise (chemicals, metals, autos, agriculture, and forest products at ~45%), coal (15%), and other bulk (5%). Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, CSX connects major ports (e.g., Savannah, Charleston, New York/New Jersey) to industrial heartlands, facilitating ~$700 billion in annual U.S. freight value. \n\nWith the adoption of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) since 2020, CSX has optimized network velocity, reducing dwell times by 40% and achieving service recovery post-2022 disruptions. In 2025, intermodal volumes grew 5% YoY amid nearshoring trends, while coal declined due to energy transitions. CSX serves 23 states, the District of Columbia, and two Canadian provinces, with key hubs like Northwest Ohio Intermodal Terminal (built 2021, expanded 2025). Revenue is ~90% from rail operations, with ancillary services like logistics via CSX Connect platform. The company employs ~22,000 people and maintains a BBB credit rating. Facing truck competition but benefiting from fuel efficiency (479 ton-miles/gallon vs. trucks' 100), CSX is positioned for modal shift in a $1 trillion U.S. freight market.

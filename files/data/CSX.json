Company Overview (CSX) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nCSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on rail transportation and real estate in North America, operating as a leading supplier of rail-based freight transportation. Based in Jacksonville, Florida, CSX Corporation is a leader in freight transportation, having moved its headquarters from Richmond, Virginia in 2003. CSX Transportation operates about 21,000 route miles of track as the leading subsidiary, serving the Eastern United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n\nCSX's transportation network serves some of the largest population centers in the nation, with nearly two-thirds of Americans living within CSX's service territory, and serves major markets in the eastern United States with access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. CSX is a Fortune 500 company that moves a broad portfolio of products across the country in a way that minimizes the effect on the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system, and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nCSX traded at $36.30 on January 16, 2026, with a market cap of $67.60 billion, a PE ratio of 23.73, a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 2.81 and a beta of 1.30. The company's 50-day moving average is $35.74 and its 200-day moving average is $34.99, with a 52 week low of $26.22 and a 52 week high of $37.54. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45, a quick ratio of 0.71 and a current ratio of 0.85. The CSX dividend yield is 1.43%.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nOn its more than 21,000 miles of track, CSX hauls shipments of coal (16% of consolidated revenue), chemicals (17%), intermodal containers (16%), automotive cargo (7%), and a diverse mix of other bulk and industrial merchandise. CSX operates an average of 1,848 trains per day, transports more than 3.5 million carloads of products and raw materials a year, maintains a fleet of more than 3,500 locomotives, and maintains a fleet of approximately 51,000 freight cars.\n\nCommodities CSX moves include agricultural products, automotive, building materials, chemicals and fertilizer, coal, food products, metals, minerals, paper, pulp and fiber, and waste. The company provides intermodal services through a network of approximately 30 terminals transporting manufactured consumer goods in containers and drayage services, including the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments, serving the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations, as well as connecting non-rail served customers through transferring products, such as plastics and ethanol from rail to trucks.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nWith the Howard Street Tunnel project completed, and once additional clearance projects are complete in early 2026, a key I-95 corridor bottleneck will be cleared and double-stacked intermodal trains will move through Baltimore. The project unlocks new lane-conversion opportunities, enabling shippers to shift even more freight from highway to rail.\n\nCSX and BNSF have introduced new, coast-to-coast, direct domestic intermodal services between Southern California and Charlotte, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida, a new service between Phoenix, Arizona, and Atlanta, Georgia, and new direct international intermodal services between the Port of New York and New Jersey, and Norfolk, Virginia, and Kansas City.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nDuring Q2 2025 earnings calls, CSX Corporation provided guidance indicating a focus on maintaining operational momentum and pursuing volume growth for the full year, with total volume remaining flat year-over-year but seeing a 4% sequential increase, driven by merchandise and coal shipments. CSX anticipates overall volume growth in 2025, driven by intermodal, aggregates, and grain markets, with the completion of the Howard Street Tunnel project expected to significantly enhance capacity and margins, while management is focused on achieving high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth over the next three years.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCSX customers ship everything from soybeans to SUVs and rely on CSX to deliver the excellent transportation service they need to support and grow their business. CSX serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through connections to more than 230 short line and regional railroads. Principal shippers include Corn Products Company of Winston-Salem, a manufacturer of corn syrup and related products, and Owens Brockway Glass Company of Eller, a manufacturer of glass products.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, CSX Transportation reported total revenue of $14.54 billion and net income of $3.47 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, CSX reported net income of approximately $694 million, a decline of about 22% compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to a $164 million goodwill impairment charge, with revenue approximately $3.59 billion, which was flat or slightly down year over year.\n\nThe transportation company reported $0.44 earnings per share (EPS) for Q3, topping analysts' consensus estimates of $0.42 by $0.02, with revenue of $3.59 billion during the quarter, and CSX had a net margin of 20.55% and a return on equity of 24.95%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Company management noted that near-term performance was affected by reduced volumes in the coal and automotive sectors\n- Intermodal pricing is grappling with pressure from depressed rates in the competing full-truckload industry, and that will likely persist into first-half 2026\n- The company faces risks from fluctuating commodity prices, such as lower export coal prices, and reduced fuel surcharges, which impacted Q2 2025 revenue\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Intermodal shipping should enjoy favorable long-term trends, including secular constraints on truckload capacity expansion and shippers' efforts to minimize transportation costs through mode conversions (truck to rail)\n- Double-stacking is a more cost-effective way to transport freight by rail compared to trucks, reducing congestion along the busy I-95 corridor, delivering environmental benefits with less emissions, and will increase business at the Port of Baltimore by approximately 160,000 containers annually and generate more than 13,000 new jobs\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAs of Q1 2025, Norfolk Southern's market share, based on total revenue, was 19.57%, placing it behind Union Pacific Corp (39.02%) and CSX Corporation (23.07%). CSX held a market share of 23.07% by revenue, slightly exceeding Norfolk Southern's. If approved, the combined UP-NS would have a dominant market share of 40% or greater in the majority of commodities that railroads haul, from containers and autos to chemicals and sand and gravel.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nUnion Pacific Railroad competitors include Amtrak, BNSF Railway, CSX Corporation, and Norfolk Southern Corporation. Norfolk Southern operates primarily east of the Mississippi, where CSX is its main competitor. Despite the fact that CSX Transportation was much larger than NS, the latter consistently earned higher profits with an overall lower operating ratio.\n\nWhile BNSF has maintained an operating ratio below 58% in 2025, CSX's ratio has climbed to 67%, reflecting operational inefficiencies and service disruptions. CSX is one of six surviving Class I railroads in North America and is a key mover of intermodal containers, coal, agricultural products, and industrial freight through major East Coast hubs and inland corridors.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nFollowing a successful merger application to the Surface Transportation Board, CSX Corporation and CSX Transportation acquired Pan Am Railways in 2022, including a 50 percent stake in Pan Am Southern. BNSF Railway and CSX Transportation took another significant step in rebuilding long-haul rail intermodal in the United States as of November 17, with the two carriers expanding their joint service to connect the West Coast with major inland hubs across the Midwest and Northeast, extending their earlier Southwest-to-Southeast partnership.\n\nCSX spokesman Austin Staton said the interline agreement with BNSF is unrelated to the UP-NS merger, stating \"I can understand why in the current context people might make that leap\". Hinrichs said CSX's partnership with BNSF came together after a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on 22 August with Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, who made it clear that they want to work together to solve these problems and create growth opportunities for all.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nCSX announced the re-opening of the expanded Howard Street Tunnel on September 26, 2025, a historic and transformative $450+ million infrastructure project that marks a major milestone in decades of effort by state, federal, and private partners to deliver a boost to Maryland's economy and the nation's supply chain.\n\nIn December 2025, the company disbanded its aviation department \"which flew corporate jets to whisk railroad executives around the system and elsewhere\". CSX recently replaced its CEO with more of a dealmaker, as there's focus on rival railroad CSX following the proposed UP-NS merger.\n\nUP and NS noted that parties claiming their merger application is incomplete are \"primarily competitors\" who will \"experience increased competition as a result of the merger,\" including BNSF, CN, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, and CSX.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, CSX presents a mixed investment opportunity with both significant strengths and notable challenges.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Strong market position with 23.07% market share in Eastern U.S. rail freight\n- Completion of transformational Howard Street Tunnel project enabling double-stack operations\n- Strategic BNSF partnership creating coast-to-coast intermodal capabilities\n- Solid financial performance with $14.54 billion revenue and strong margins\n- Access to two-thirds of U.S. population through extensive network\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Operating ratio deteriorated to 67% vs. BNSF's 58%\n- Q3 2025 earnings declined 22% due to coal market weakness and goodwill impairment\n- Exposure to cyclical coal and automotive sectors facing headwinds\n- Competitive pressure from proposed UP-NS transcontinental merger\n\n**Growth Catalysts:**\n- Howard Street Tunnel completion unlocking 160,000 additional containers annually\n- BNSF partnership capturing market share from Norfolk Southern\n- Long-term intermodal growth trends favoring rail over trucking\n- Infrastructure investments positioning for future capacity expansion\n\nGiven the current stock price of approximately $36.30 and analyst consensus target of $39.13, along with the company's strategic positioning and recent infrastructure investments, CSX appears positioned for moderate growth despite near-term headwinds.\n\n**Buy Rating: 6.8/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $42.00**\n\nThis rating reflects CSX's solid fundamentals and strategic positioning, tempered by operational challenges and competitive pressures. The fair value estimate considers the company's infrastructure investments, market position, and long-term growth potential in intermodal transportation, while factoring in execution risks and competitive dynamics.",

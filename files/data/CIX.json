Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company operates through three main segments: Wealth Management (retail-focused advice via independent advisors), Asset Management (institutional and mutual funds), and Canadian Wealth Management (traditional Canadian operations). With approximately C$488.9 billion in total assets under management and administration (AUMA) as of Q2 2024, CI serves retail investors, high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and advisors across Canada and the U.S. The firm has aggressively expanded into the U.S. RIA (Registered Investment Advisor) market through bolt-on acquisitions, positioning itself as a consolidator in the fragmented wealth sector. CI differentiates via its advisor-centric model, offering back-office support, technology platforms, and product access without proprietary product bias. Recent strategic shifts include a focus on recurring fee-based revenue, U.S. growth, and capital returns via dividends and buybacks, amid a transition from legacy Canadian mutual fund pressures to scalable U.S. platforms.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 8, 2024)**: Total revenue C$677 million (verified from company press release); adjusted net income C$147 million; adjusted EBITDA C$288 million (up 32% YoY).

Potential: Expanding U.S. family offices post-Corient.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong governance (ISS QualityScore 3/10); growing ESG AUM (10% of total).\n- **Management**: CEO Amit Mookim (since 2021) focused on U.S.; insider ownership ~1%.\n- **Risks**: FX exposure (35% USD revenue); advisor poaching in competitive U.S.\n- **Sentiment**: Positive analyst upgrades (e.g., Scotiabank to Sector Outperform Sep 2024); online forums (Reddit/StockTwits) highlight SIB as bullish signal amid 20% YTD stock gain.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Hold core position; add on dips.

Moderate risk from debt offset by deleveraging progress.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: C$28.00 (26% upside). Based on 10x 2025E EBITDA (consensus C$1.2B EBITDA), 2x sales multiple, and 15% U.S. growth premium. DCF implies C$26-30 range for growth-oriented portfolio (moderate risk: beta 1.2).

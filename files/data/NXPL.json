Its core platforms—NextPlat (www.nextplat.com) and Agnes (www.agnescp.com)—facilitate B2B and B2C transactions across categories like consumer electronics, apparel, home goods, automotive parts, and industrial equipment. The company targets commercial retailers, wholesalers, and government entities (e.g., U.S. Department of Defense surplus via GSA auctions), using AI-driven tools for dynamic pricing, inventory optimization, real-time bidding, and international logistics. NextPlat disrupts traditional liquidation channels by offering scalable, data analytics-powered platforms with reach in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

Hold if risk-averse.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $2.75** – Based on 2x fwd. P/S (2025E rev $25M est. from analyst consensus/earnings guide) + 20% growth premium; implies 144% upside.

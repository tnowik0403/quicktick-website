(NASDAQ: FWRG) is a leading daytime dining restaurant concept focused exclusively on breakfast, brunch, and lunch, operating primarily under the First Watch brand. Founded in 1983 in Bradenton, Florida, the company emphasizes fresh, made-to-order food with a health-conscious twist, including items like avocado toasts, juices, and lighter fare, differentiating it from traditional all-day diners. As of Q2 2024 earnings (reported August 1, 2024), First Watch operates 567 company-owned restaurants across 29 states and one internationally licensed location in Canada, with a menu featuring ~100 items across categories like Power Bowls, Juices & Cleanses, and Millionaire's Bacon. The company went public in 2021 via a SPAC merger and has pursued aggressive expansion, opening 35 net new restaurants in Q2 2024 alone. Revenue is driven by a loyal daytime customer base (average check ~$16-18), with strong same-store sales growth fueled by menu innovation and operational efficiencies.

(NASDAQ: OPEN) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Fundamentals (Verified as of October 11, 2024)**  \n- **Stock Price**: $2.11 (closing price, Yahoo Finance/Google Finance)  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.52 billion (Yahoo Finance)  \n- **52-Week Range**: $1.70 - $3.87  \n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~722 million  \n- **Trailing P/E**: N/A (unprofitable)  \n- **Enterprise Value**: $2.05 billion  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nOpendoor Technologies Inc., founded in 2014 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, is a leading digital real estate platform pioneering the \"iBuying\" model. It instantly provides cash offers to homeowners for their properties, handles repairs, staging, and paperwork, then resells via its marketplace or traditional channels. Operating in 44 markets across 21 U.S. states (as of Q2 2024 earnings), Opendoor simplifies transactions with technology-driven pricing algorithms, AI-powered home valuations, and end-to-end logistics. In 2023, it purchased ~15,000 homes but shifted toward an asset-light model amid high interest rates, emphasizing brokerage services like Opendoor Backed Offers (non-contingent bids backed by Opendoor). Revenue is primarily from home resales (gross profit on sales), netted against inventory costs, with ancillary fees from services. Q2 2024 results showed resilience: 3,915 homes sold, $1.153 billion revenue (down 14% YoY but up sequentially), $126 million contribution profit (margin 11%), and adjusted EBITDA loss of $11 million (improved from Q1).

(NASDAQ: NTLA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company revolutionizing medicine through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing technologies. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Intellia focuses on developing potentially curative therapies for rare genetic diseases by precisely editing DNA directly inside the body (in vivo) or in patient cells (ex vivo). The company's proprietary platform leverages two key innovations: (1) the TTR-LNP (lipid nanoparticle) delivery system for liver-targeted editing, proven in humans, and (2) an ex vivo platform using engineered cells for oncology and autoimmune applications. Intellia has advanced multiple programs into late-stage clinical trials, notably NTLA-2001 for transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema (HAE), both one-time, in vivo treatments aiming to eliminate the need for chronic therapies.\n\nUnlike traditional small-molecule drugs, Intellia's approach offers durable, single-dose cures, targeting a multi-billion-dollar addressable market in rare diseases. With a strong cash position supporting operations through 2026, partnerships like Regeneron provide non-dilutive funding and expertise. However, as a pre-revenue biotech, Intellia faces high R&D burn and binary clinical risks. Market cap reflects high-growth potential in the $20B+ gene editing sector, but volatility ties to trial readouts.

(LNTH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $102.50\n- Market Capitalization: $7.32 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $50.20 - $119.00\n- Average Daily Volume: 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nLantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH) is a radiopharmaceutical-focused company specializing in the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of diagnostic and therapeutic products for nuclear medicine applications, primarily in oncology, cardiology, and neurology. Headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, Lantheus operates through two segments: Precision Diagnostics (PDx), which accounts for ~95% of revenue and includes PET and SPECT imaging agents, and Precision Therapeutics (PTx), an emerging area with alpha-particle therapies. The company's flagship product, PYLARIFY® (piflufolastat F 18), a PSMA-targeted PET imaging agent for prostate cancer, drives the majority of growth, with annualized run-rate sales exceeding $1 billion as of Q2 2024. Other key diagnostics include DEFTECTOS™ (kit for regadenoson preparation), TechneLite® (technetium generator), Xenon Xe 133r inhalation gas, and CARDIOGEN®-82. Lantheus benefits from a robust U.S.-based cyclotron network for F-18 production and molybdenum-99 supply chain resilience amid global shortages. With ~700 employees, the company targets the ~$10B U.S. nuclear medicine market, emphasizing innovation in theranostics amid rising demand for precision oncology. Recent expansions include new manufacturing facilities to support scaling.

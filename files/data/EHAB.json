(EHAB) is a leading provider of home-based personal care and rehabilitation services in the United States, operating through two segments: Home Health and Hospice. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company delivers patient-centered care to over 250,000 patients annually across 260 home health and 110 hospice locations in 34 states, serving predominantly Medicare beneficiaries. Formed via a spin-off from Encompass Health Corporation on January 31, 2023, Enhabit focuses on clinical excellence, leveraging interdisciplinary care teams including nurses, therapists (PT/OT/ST), and aides. Its Home Health segment offers skilled nursing, therapy, and aide services post-hospitalization or for chronic conditions, while Hospice provides palliative end-of-life care. Enhabit emphasizes value-based care models, technology integration (e.g., electronic health records), and operational efficiency to navigate reimbursement pressures. With ~11,000 employees, it targets the growing $100B+ U.S. home health/hospice market driven by aging demographics (10,000 Baby Boomers turning 65 daily). Despite post-spin challenges like volume declines and labor costs, Enhabit reported Q2 2024 revenue of $274.3 million (verified from Aug 6, 2024 earnings release), positioning it for modest recovery via clinical referrals and Medicare Advantage expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024)**: Revenue $274.3M (-10.7% YoY); Home Health revenue $182.8M (-14.8% YoY); Hospice revenue $91.5M (+7.1% YoY).

Monitoring divestitures (e.g., LHCG assets).\n- **Clients**: 75% Medicare FFS, 15% MA, 10% commercial/private pay. Major: Medicare Advantage plans (Elevance, Cigna); hospital systems (HCA, Tenet). Potential: Expanding MA with CVS/Aetna amid 30% MA penetration sector-wide.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: High caregiver satisfaction (90%+); community impact via 250K patients/year.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (CMS audits up 20%); competition from vertical integration (UNH/LHC).\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 4 Buy/3 Hold (avg target $12.50, per MarketBeat Oct 2024).\n- **Moat**: Dense footprint in Sunbelt states; 4-star CMS quality ratings.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold)**: Balanced for moderate risk/growth. Hospice tailwinds and rate hikes support stabilization, but Home Health weakness and execution risks cap upside. Trading at 6x 2025 EV/EBITDA (vs. peers 12x); undervalued but needs volume inflection.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $12.00** (33% upside). DCF-based (3% rev CAGR, 12% EBITDA margin by 2026, 8% discount rate/WACC); aligns with analyst consensus for growth portfolio. Hold for Q3 results (Nov 2024); buy on dips below $8.",

growth limited by size/CRE risks vs. peers. Attractive for moderate-risk growth portfolios seeking 10-15% annual returns.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $48.50** (13% upside from $42.87): Based on 11x 2025E EPS ($4.40, per Q3 guidance/management), 1.1x TBV ($44), and DCF (8% discount rate, 4% perpetual growth). Strong growth upside if rates stabilize and M&A materializes.",

Founded in 1842, the company provides a wide range of industrial metals including carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels, aluminum, copper, brass, and nickel, along with value-added processing services such as cutting, bending, machining, and inventory management. Ryerson operates 98 locations across 21 U.S. states, 6 Canadian provinces, Mexico, and China, focusing on industries like metal fabrication, industrial machinery, construction, transportation (auto, rail, truck), oil & gas, and consumer products.\n\nThe company's business model emphasizes supply chain solutions, with ~70% of revenues from metals distribution and ~30% from value-added fabrication/processing. It sources from major steel mills (e.g., Nucor, Steel Dynamics) and serves as a key intermediary in a fragmented $150+ billion North American metals distribution market. Ryerson differentiates through its extensive inventory (over 100,000 SKUs), just-in-time delivery, and digital tools like the Ryerson Store e-commerce platform. In 2023, it reported $5.1 billion in net sales, navigating cyclical steel pricing and demand volatility. Recent strategic shifts include bolstering value-added services (now ~25-30% of sales mix) to improve margins amid commodity price swings.

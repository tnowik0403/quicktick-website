(NASDAQ: ITRI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $103.82 (closing price as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.72 billion (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $56.95 - $123.70  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nItron, Inc. (ITRI) is a global leader in intelligent metering, networking, and software solutions for resource management, primarily serving utilities in energy (electricity, natural gas), water, and smart city sectors. Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Liberty Lake, Washington, Itron enables utilities to optimize operations through end-to-end intelligent distributed intelligence (IDI) platforms. Its offerings include smart meters, communication modules, edge intelligence devices, network management software, and advanced analytics for demand response, grid optimization, and sustainability. With a focus on IoT-enabled digital transformation, Itron helps utilities reduce non-technical losses, improve revenue protection, and support decarbonization goals like net-zero emissions.\n\nThe company operates in over 100 countries, with ~4,700 employees and a diverse revenue mix: ~60% from Device Solutions (meters/networking), ~25% from Software & Services, and the balance from Pipistrel (eVTOL drones acquired in 2022). Itron's fiscal 2023 revenue was $2.2 billion, driven by smart meter deployments amid global utility digitization. Recent tailwinds include regulatory mandates for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in Europe and North America, plus growing demand for water metering and smart city applications. Challenges include supply chain volatility and competition in commoditized metering. Itron's strategy emphasizes recurring software/services revenue (targeting 30%+ of total) and expansion into high-growth adjacencies like distributed energy resources (DERs) and edge computing.

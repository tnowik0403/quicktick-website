The company offers a full suite of imaging modalities, including MRI (41% of revenue), CT (20%), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, mammography, and X-ray services. RadNet serves approximately 10% of the U.S. outpatient imaging market, focusing on high-volume, cost-effective diagnostics for hospitals, health systems, radiologists, and patients. Its business model emphasizes de novo center development, strategic acquisitions, joint ventures (JVs), and technology integration like AI-powered workflows.\n\nFounded in 1980 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, RadNet generates revenue primarily from fee-for-service (FFS) procedures (96% of revenue), with the remainder from capitation and JVs. In 2023, it processed over 10 million procedures. The company is expanding into high-growth areas like breast imaging (via the Jean Haydel Breast Cancer Detection Center network) and AI diagnostics through its wholly-owned eRAD subsidiary. RadNet benefits from an aging U.S. population and rising demand for non-invasive imaging, while navigating reimbursement pressures and staffing shortages.

Company Overview (VST) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE: VST) is a leading Fortune 500 integrated retail electricity and power generation company based in Irving, Texas, that provides essential resources to customers, businesses, and communities from California to Maine. Vistra is one of the largest competitive power generators in the U.S., with a capacity of approximately 44,000 megawatts, or enough to power 22 million homes, operating in all of the major competitive wholesale markets in the country.\n\nAt the heart of Vistra's operations is an integrated business model which combines the delivery of reliable, affordable electricity to millions of residential and business customers with a robust, multi-faceted generation fleet. The company operates through five segments: Retail, Texas, East, West, and Asset Closure. Vistra is a leader in transforming the energy landscape, with an unyielding focus on reliability, affordability, and sustainability, powered by a diverse portfolio that includes natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Through its family of retail brands, Vistra serves approximately 5 million residential, commercial, and industrial retail customers.\n\nThe company has a remarkable corporate regeneration story, emerging from the largest bankruptcy in U.S. power sector history. Its lineage traces back to the TXU Corporation, which in 2007 became the subject of the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) ever recorded—a $45 billion deal led by KKR and TPG. Renamed Energy Future Holdings (EFH), the company collapsed under the weight of massive debt and plummeting natural gas prices, filing for a landmark Chapter 11 bankruptcy before emerging as Vistra in October 2016.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nBased on the latest available data:\n- **Current Stock Price**: $171.42 (as of January 13, 2026)\n- **52-Week Range**: $90.51 - $219.81\n- **Market Capitalization**: $58.08 billion\n- **Beta**: 1.84\n- **Dividend Yield**: 0.53%\n- **Forward P/E**: 15.67\n- **EBITDA**: $9.89 billion\n- **EBITDA Margin**: 45.72%\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Generation Assets\nVistra operates a diverse portfolio that includes natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Specifically:\n- **Nuclear**: 6.5 GW of nuclear capacity, making it the second-largest competitive nuclear operator in the U.S.\n- **Natural Gas**: 27 GW of natural gas generation\n- **Coal**: 8.7 GW of coal generation\n- **Solar and Battery Storage**: 1.4 GW\n\n### Retail Services\nSubsidiaries include TXU Energy, Dynegy, Ambit, Energy Harbor, and Homefield Energy. Vistra holds the #1 retail position in Texas and serves 5 million customers in 20 states, including almost a third of all Texas electricity consumers.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Nuclear Expansion with Meta Partnership\nVistra today announced it has entered into 20-year PPAs to provide more than 2,600 megawatts of zero-carbon energy from a combination of three different Vistra nuclear plants to support Meta's operations in the region. The agreements include 2,176 MW of operating generation and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases, which will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the United States.\n\nMeta's purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online.\n\n### Natural Gas Expansion\nIn September we announced plans to move forward with two new natural gas power units, which together will add approximately 860 MW of capacity in the Permian to aid in meeting West Texas' growing power needs, particularly as the oil and gas industry electrifies operations.\n\n### Cogentrix Acquisition\nAcquisition of Cogentrix includes ~5,500 megawatts of modern natural gas generation assets at an attractive purchase price, net of expected tax benefits, of approximately $730/kW of capacity. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and certain state regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in mid-to-late-2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nVistra's growth strategy focuses on three key pillars:\n\n### AI and Data Center Power Demand\nThe \"AI Power Demand\" super-cycle is the single largest macro driver for Vistra. Data centers are projected to consume nearly 10% of total U.S. electricity by 2030, up from roughly 4% in 2023.\n\n### Integrated Business Model\nVistra operates an \"integrated\" business model, which creates a natural hedge between its power generation (wholesale) and its retail customer base. It coordinates its generation fleet with its retail sales, essentially creating a closed-loop system that manages risk and optimizes margins.\n\n### Strategic Acquisitions\nThe company has pursued aggressive expansion through strategic acquisitions:\n- Under former CEO Curt Morgan, the company began an aggressive consolidation strategy, acquiring Dynegy in 2018 and Ambit Energy in 2019. However, the most pivotal moment in its modern history occurred in March 2024, with the completion of the $3.43 billion acquisition of Energy Harbor.\n- Recent acquisition of 2.6 GW of natural gas capacity from Lotus Infrastructure Partners, a deal that closed in October.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Existing Corporate Clients\n- **Meta Platforms**: Meta has secured two 20-year power purchase agreements covering a total of 2,609 MW of carbon-free generation and capacity from Vistra's nuclear fleet in the PJM market.\n- The company also has deals moving forward with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are expected to start delivering in 2026, plus a 1,200 MW agreement from an unnamed nuclear buyer.\n\n### Market Segments\n- **Retail**: Vistra serves approximately 4.6 million residential customers across multiple states, primarily in Texas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.\n- **Commercial & Industrial**: Vistra supports 500,000+ commercial and industrial customers across multiple sectors.\n- **Wholesale**: Vistra provides wholesale electricity to 37 utility companies across 11 states, with annual wholesale power sales of $3.2 billion.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\n- **Revenue**: $4.97 billion, down 20.9% over the same period last year\n- **Net Income**: $652 million\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**: $1.581 billion, with $1.544 billion from Generation and $37 million from Retail\n- **EPS**: $1.75 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 by 45.83%\n\n### Guidance\n- **2025 Adjusted EBITDA**: Narrowed to $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion\n- **2026 Adjusted EBITDA**: $6.8 billion to $7.6 billion\n- **2025 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Before Growth**: $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion\n\n### Capital Allocation\n- Approximately 165 million shares repurchased since November 2021, reducing shares outstanding by about 30%\n- Board authorized $1 B incremental share repurchases through YE 2027, targeting at least $1 B in annual share buybacks and $300 M in dividends\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **AI Power Demand**: Demand for electricity is ramping up hard, especially from data centers and broader electrification. And Vistra has leaned into that with more solar and battery storage projects, fresh gas-fired plants in Texas, and the recent pickup of seven modern gas units.\n- **Nuclear Renaissance**: Notably, nuclear is getting a lot of attention now for AI power needs, and the closing of the Comanche Peak deal has cleared up most of the big question marks around hyperscaler conversions.\n- **Market Scarcity**: Data centers require 24/7 power, which wind and solar cannot provide alone. This has placed a \"scarcity premium\" on nuclear and natural gas.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **High Leverage**: Vistra's debt-to-equity ratio is 3.74, indicating a high level of leverage.\n- **Operational Challenges**: Vistra Corp. has reported a decline in EBITDA for its generation segment, which fell to $593 million, reflecting a 5% decrease year-over-year primarily due to unplanned outages, raising concerns about operational reliability.\n- **Regulatory Risks**: Regulatory review uncertainty has increased after the [Department of Justice] opposition to [Constellation's] acquisition of Calpine transaction\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n- **Texas Retail**: Vistra holds the #1 retail position in Texas\n- **Nuclear**: now the second-largest competitive nuclear operator in the U.S.\n- **Overall Generation**: one of the largest competitive power generators in the U.S., with a capacity of approximately 44,000 megawatts\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors\n- **Constellation Energy (CEG)**: Vistra's primary rival is Constellation Energy (NYSE: CEG). While Constellation has a larger nuclear fleet, Vistra bulls argue that its integrated retail business (TXU Energy) and its significant natural gas exposure in Texas (ERCOT) provide superior diversification.\n- **NRG Energy (NRG)**: Vistra's main competitor in the retail space. While NRG has focused heavily on the \"connected home,\" Vistra has focused on the \"generation scale.\"\n\n### Performance Metrics\nVistra Corp.'s return on equity of 42.58% beat Constellation Energy Corp.'s return on equity of 23%. However, Constellation Energy Corp. has a net margin of 8.01% compared to Vistra Corp.'s net margin of 13.94%.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Major Transactions\n- **Energy Harbor Acquisition (March 2024)**: This deal added three major nuclear plants to its portfolio, fundamentally shifting its carbon profile and valuation.\n- **Cogentrix Energy Acquisition (Pending)**: Vistra will acquire these assets at a net purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion, which is comprised of the payment of approximately $2.3 billion of cash consideration and approximately $0.9 billion of Vistra stock consideration\n- **Lotus Infrastructure Partners**: we successfully closed the acquisition of seven natural gas plants, adding approximately 2,600 MW of capacity to our portfolio\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\n- **Meta Platforms**: 20-year nuclear power purchase agreements\n- **Amazon and Microsoft**: Pending power delivery agreements starting 2026\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### January 2026 - Meta Nuclear Deal\nVistra Corp. (NYSE: VST) stock experienced a dramatic surge in premarket trading on January 9, 2026, jumping 13.28% to $170.59 as of 6:33 AM EST following the announcement of a landmark nuclear energy agreement with Meta.\n\n### Q3 2025 Earnings\n- Beat EPS estimates but missed revenue expectations\n- Vistra's Q3 revenue of $4.97 billion fell 19.3% short of the $6.16 billion consensus estimate.\n- More important, it initiated 2026 guidance at $6.8 billion to $7.6 billion, representing 22% to 29% growth from the midpoint of 2025 guidance.\n\n### Environmental Targets\nThe company has committed to a 60% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as compared to our 2010 baseline, and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, assuming necessary technological advancements and public policy incentives are achieved.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Analyst Consensus\n- **Rating**: analysts have attributed a rating of \"Strong Buy\" for the stock with a mean target price of $242.33. Out of 19 analysts covering the stock, 16 have a \"Strong Buy\" rating, and three have a \"Hold\" rating.\n- **Price Target Range**: According to Wall Street analysts, the average 1-year price target for VST is 239.71 USD with a low forecast of 217.00 USD and a high forecast of 256.00 USD.\n- **Upside Potential**: This denotes an upside potential of about 39% from current levels.\n\n### Investment Thesis\n**Strengths:**\n- Dominant position in high-growth Texas market\n- Integrated business model providing natural hedge\n- Strong exposure to AI-driven power demand\n- Significant nuclear fleet with long-term contracts\n- Aggressive capital return program\n\n**Risks:**\n- High leverage (debt-to-equity ratio of 3.74x)\n- Operational reliability concerns\n- Regulatory approval risks for acquisitions\n- Dependence on commodity markets\n\n### Buy Rating: **8.7/10**\n\n**Rationale**: Vistra represents a compelling investment opportunity driven by the structural shift toward AI-powered data center demand. The company's integrated business model, dominant Texas position, and substantial nuclear fleet position it well to capitalize on the \"AI power demand super-cycle.\" Recent long-term contracts with Meta provide earnings visibility, while the Cogentrix acquisition expands capacity in key markets. However, high leverage and execution risks prevent a higher rating.\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: **$225**\n\n**Basis**: Our fair value estimate reflects:\n- 2026 EBITDA midpoint of $7.2 billion\n- EV/EBITDA multiple of 12x (reflecting growth premium to utilities)\n- Adjusted for net debt and share count changes from acquisitions\n- Premium for AI infrastructure exposure and long-term contracted cash flows\n\nThis represents approximately 31% upside from current levels, supporting a strong buy recommendation for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance.",

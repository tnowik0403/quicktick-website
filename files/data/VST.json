(VST) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $127.68 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $43.82 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and company filings)  \n**52-Week Range:** $30.51 - $128.64  \n\n## Company Overview\nVistra Corp. (NYSE: VST) is the largest competitive power generator and retail electricity provider in the United States, operating as an integrated energy company focused on electricity generation, wholesale energy sales, and retail energy services. Headquartered in Irving, Texas, Vistra serves approximately 5 million customers across 20 states and the District of Columbia through its retail brands, including TXU Energy, Discount Power, and Ambit Energy. Its generation fleet totals ~41,000 MW of capacity (as of Q2 2024), spanning natural gas (60%), nuclear (15%), coal (10%), solar (8%), and battery energy storage systems (BESS, 7%), with a growing emphasis on cleaner energy sources to meet rising demand from data centers and electrification.\n\nVistra operates in key deregulated markets like Texas (ERCOT), PJM, and MISO, positioning it to capitalize on volatile power prices and load growth. The company has pivoted aggressively toward nuclear and renewables amid the AI-driven data center boom, owning four nuclear plants (Comanche Peak, Clinton, LaSalle, and the acquired Energy Harbor sites). Retail operations provide stable cash flows via long-term contracts, while wholesale generation leverages merchant pricing. Recent strategic moves, including the $3.43 billion acquisition of Energy Harbor (closed March 1, 2024), have boosted nuclear capacity by 4 GW, making Vistra the second-largest nuclear fleet owner in the U.S. after Constellation Energy. Vistra's growth is fueled by hyperscaler demand (e.g., Microsoft, Google), with nuclear assets offering reliable, low-carbon baseload power. Challenges include regulatory scrutiny on nuclear restarts and gas plant emissions, but tailwinds from power shortages position Vistra for outsized growth in a sector strained by ~15% annual U.S. electricity demand growth projections through 2030.

Unlike traditional private equity, CODI employs a \"buy-and-hold forever\" strategy, taking controlling stakes (often 100%) in subsidiaries across diversified sectors including niche consumer products, specialty industrials, performance materials, and software/services. As of Q2 2024, it owns eight core subsidiaries: 5.11 Tactical (tactical apparel), Arnold Magnetic Technologies (precision magnets), Boon Inc. (baby products), PrimaLoft (synthetic insulation), The Honey Pot Company (feminine care), Lugano Diamonds (luxury jewelry), Clean-Start (JanSan services), and Marucci Sports (baseball equipment, acquired August 2024). CODI provides centralized support in finance, HR, IT, and M&A while allowing subsidiary autonomy. This structure targets recession-resistant niches with high barriers to entry, recurring revenue, and strong brands. In Q2 2024 (reported August 1, 2024), consolidated revenue reached $581.4 million (+6% YoY), with GAAP net income of $12.0 million ($0.45/share). The model emphasizes organic growth, bolt-on acquisitions, and operational efficiencies, positioning CODI for compounding returns in fragmented markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 12, 2024**: Announced definitive agreement to acquire National Beef Packing Company, LLC (leading U.S. beef processor) for $1.525 billion in cash/stock (expected close Q1 2025).

Based on 10x 2025E Adj. EBITDA ($380M projected post-beef synergies), peer avg multiple adjustment. Growth portfolio fit: High upside (M&A lever), moderate risk (proven model, 15% vol < market).

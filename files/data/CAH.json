(NYSE: CAH) is a leading multinational healthcare services and products company headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, founded in 1971. It operates through two primary segments: Pharmaceutical (90%+ of revenue) and Medical (10%). The Pharmaceutical segment is the largest independent distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter products, and biologics in the U.S., serving retail chain pharmacies (e.g., CVS, Walgreens), hospitals, health systems, and independent pharmacies. It also provides third-party logistics (3PL), specialty pharmaceutical distribution, and nuclear pharmacy services via ~100 U.S. locations dispensing radiopharmaceuticals. The Medical segment manufactures and distributes branded and private-label medical, surgical, and laboratory products, including gloves, apparel, and fluids, with a focus on infection prevention and at-home care. Cardinal supports the U.S. healthcare supply chain amid rising demand from aging populations and chronic disease prevalence. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it generated ~$226.8 billion in revenue, navigating challenges like opioid litigation (resolved via $7.2B settlement in 2022, with payments ongoing through 2038).

Rationale: Undervalued at 12x FY2025 EPS midpoint $7.65; 5-7% revenue CAGR, 10%+ EPS growth, 20%+ FCF upside supports re-rating to 15x P/E).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $145 (15% upside from $126.48; DCF-based with 8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, incorporating FY2025 guidance and 6% sector CAGR. Moderate risk: Diversified revenue mitigates shortages/pricing risks).",

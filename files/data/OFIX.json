Headquartered in Lewisville, Texas, with operations in over 20 countries, Orthofix designs, manufactures, and distributes a broad portfolio of bioactive, surgical, and non-surgical products. Its spine division offers minimally invasive fixation systems, biologics, and motion preservation implants like the M6-C™ artificial cervical disc and the NICE® neuromodulation system for chronic low back pain. The orthopedics segment provides external and internal fixation devices, trauma systems, and limb reconstruction solutions such as the Orthofix Limb Reconstruction System (OLRS) and Contours VPS. Additionally, the BioStim business delivers non-invasive bone growth stimulators (e.g., PhysioStim®, Spinal-Stim®) cleared for treating nonunion fractures and spinal fusions. Following its transformative merger with SeaSpine Holdings in January 2023, Orthofix has expanded its addressable market to approximately $11 billion across spine biologics, enabling technologies, and orthopedic trauma. The company targets complex surgical procedures and chronic pain management, emphasizing clinical evidence from over 60 peer-reviewed studies and a surgeon-centric sales model. With ~1,100 employees, Orthofix generated $744.6 million in FY2023 revenue, positioning it as a nimble innovator in a fragmented, high-growth medtech sector amid rising demand for outpatient procedures and biologics.

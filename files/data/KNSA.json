(KNSA) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing, and commercializing therapeutics for chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, with an emphasis on rare conditions. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda (with U.S. operations in Boston, MA), the company has two FDA-approved products: KINERET (anakinra), a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, and ARCALYST (rilonacept), an IL-1 trap. KINERET, originally developed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (SOBI), targets rare autoinflammatory diseases including Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA), and common indications like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD). ARCALYST is approved for CAPS and, as of August 2024, for recurrent pericarditis (RP) in adults and children 12+ years following the FDA's acceptance of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) with Priority Review (PDUFA target February 2025). Kiniksa's strategy leverages high-barrier-to-entry rare disease markets with premium pricing, aiming for label expansions and pipeline advancement in immunology. The company reported Q2 2024 total revenue of $84.3 million (up 36% YoY), driven by KINERET net sales of $74.4 million, with no ARCALYST U.S. sales yet pending broader launch. Cash position stood at $480.1 million as of June 30, 2024, supporting operations into 2027.

Moderate risk assumes 70% RP approval odds.",

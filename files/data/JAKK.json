Daily Volume (3 months): 186,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc. is a leading multi-brand toy and consumer products company focused on designing, building, marketing, and distributing toys, games, and seasonal products worldwide. Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Santa Monica, California, the company operates through two main segments: Toys/Consumer Products and Costumes. Its portfolio emphasizes licensed properties, generating over 80% of revenue from collaborations with major entertainment brands. Key licenses include Disney (Frozen, Disney Princesses), Nintendo (Super Mario, Pokémon), Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega), and Universal (Minions, Jurassic World). Products span action figures, vehicles, playsets, plush toys, costumes, and outdoor toys, sold via major retailers like Walmart, Target, Amazon, and Toys \"R\" Us internationally.\n\nJAKKS targets children aged 2-12, emphasizing affordable, high-play-value items amid a $110 billion global toy market (Statista 2024). The company has pivoted toward cost efficiencies post-COVID supply chain disruptions, with a leaner structure after workforce reductions and facility optimizations. In FY2023 (ended Dec 31, 2023), it reported net sales of $691.4 million, but faces cyclical pressures from retail inventory management. Recent strategies focus on evergreen licenses, e-commerce growth, and international expansion in Europe and Asia, positioning JAKKS as a nimble mid-tier player against giants like Mattel and Hasbro.

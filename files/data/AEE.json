Through its principal subsidiaries—Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (ATXI)—Ameren generates, transmits, and distributes electricity and natural gas. Ameren Missouri operates a diverse fleet including nuclear (Callaway plant), coal (phasing out), natural gas, hydro, solar, and wind assets, with ~8,500 MW capacity. Ameren Illinois focuses on transmission and distribution for ~1.2 million electric customers under regulated rates. ATXI manages high-voltage transmission lines. The company emphasizes clean energy transition, targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, with $45.6B in planned capital investments through 2028 (per 2024 IR guidance). In 2023, regulated operations drove 95%+ of earnings, benefiting from constructive rate cases (e.g., Missouri multi-year rate plan approved 2023).

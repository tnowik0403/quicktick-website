Daily Volume (3 months): 1.02 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MDGL) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of liver disease affecting up to 15 million adults in the U.S. alone. The company's lead product, Rezdiffra (resmetirom), is a once-daily, proprietary, liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonist that targets the root causes of MASH by reducing liver fat and improving fibrosis without the side effects of broad thyroid activation. On March 14, 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Rezdiffra as the first and only therapy for adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver scarring (F2-F3 fibrosis), confirmed by biopsy, alongside diet and exercise. Madrigal launched Rezdiffra commercially in the U.S. in late April 2024, targeting ~9,000 U.S. liver specialists via a specialized sales force of ~100 reps. With no other approved MASH therapies, Madrigal holds a pioneering position in a market projected to exceed $50 billion by 2030. The company, founded in 2011 and headquartered in West Conshohocken, PA, has no other commercial products but advances its pipeline through ongoing trials. Cash reserves support operations into 2026.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **March 14, 2024**: FDA accelerated approval of Rezdiffra for noncirrhotic MASH (F2-F3 fibrosis), based on MAESTRO-NASH Phase 3 trial data showing significant MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement.\n- **April 2024**: U.S. commercial launch begins; initial focus on high-prescribing liver specialists.\n- **May 10, 2024**: Presented MAESTRO-NASH biopsy data at EASL Congress, reinforcing efficacy (25% MASH resolution vs. 10% placebo).\n- **June 2024**: Rezdiffra included in CVS Caremark formulary (largest U.S. PBM by lives covered).\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Product sales: $12.2 million (first quarter of revenue); R&D expenses: $44.3 million; G&A: $53.1 million; Net loss: $89.4 million; Cash: $931 million (end-Q2).\n- **September 12, 2024**: Presented MAESTRO-NASH-3/4 topline data at EASL; confirmed Rezdiffra's efficacy/safety in larger cohorts.\n- **October 3, 2024**: Announced pricing at ~$47,400 wholesale acquisition cost for 12-week starter pack, competitive with other liver therapies.\n- Ongoing: Enrollment complete in MAESTRO-NASH-OLE (open-label extension); data expected Q4 2024.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **U.S. Launch Ramp**: Build specialist prescriber base (target: 70% of top prescribers by YE2024); expand to primary care HCPs in 2025.\n- **Label Expansion**: Pursue full approval (Q4 2024 PDUFA) via confirmatory trials; advance to compensated MASH cirrhosis (MAESTRO-NASH-COM1/2 trials dosing).\n- **International Expansion**: EMA filing accepted (opinion expected H1 2025); Japan PMDA consultation complete.\n- **Patient Services**: Hub model (Madrigal Elevate) for adherence, affordability (copay assistance up to $18,000/year).\n- **Pipeline Advancement**: Explore combo therapies; no new assets disclosed.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | First-mover advantage; $931M cash runway to 2026; strong biopsy data differentiates from competitors. | Slow sales ramp (Q2 revenue $12M vs. peak sales est. $2-3B); high G&A burn ($53M Q2); execution risks in specialist-only model. |\n| **Sector**  | MASH epidemic (U.S. prevalence ~5-7%); reimbursement tailwinds (CVS, OptumRx coverage); growing awareness post-FDA approval. | Diagnostic barriers (biopsy requirement limits addressable market to ~1M initially); emerging competition; payer scrutiny on novel pricing. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Rezdiffra (resmetirom)**: Oral THR-β agonist; approved for F2-F3 MASH; 80mg/100mg doses; Q2 2024 sales: $12.2 million (180 patients on therapy by quarter-end).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Label Expansion**: Full approval (PDUFA Q4 2024); F4 cirrhosis (Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH-COM1/2 initiated 2024).\n- **MAESTRO-NASH-OLE**: Long-term data (up to 5 years) readout Q4 2024.\n- **Pediatric/Combo Studies**: Early exploration; no timelines.\n- No other pipeline assets disclosed.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current (U.S. MASH therapeutics)**: 100% (sole approved therapy as of Oct 2024; nascent market, <1% penetration).\n- **Forecast**: \n  | Year       | Est.

First-mover in $50B+ MASH market with $2-3B peak sales potential outweighs near-term ramp risks; cash-rich for catalysts (Q4 data/PDUFA).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $380/share (33% upside from $286). Based on DCF (10% discount, 25% IRR for growth portfolio); aligns with consensus PTs ($336 median) adjusted for Q2 momentum and MAESTRO data. Moderate risk: Biotech volatility, but derisked by approval/launch.",

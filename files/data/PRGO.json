Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland (U.S. ops in Allegan, MI), Perrigo operates two segments: Consumer Self-Care Americas (CSCA, ~75% revenue) and Consumer Self-Care International (CSCI, ~25%). The company manufactures and markets products like analgesics, cough/cold remedies, vitamins, oral care, skincare, eye care, and store-brand infant formulas, serving major retailers (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Amazon). With ~9,000 employees, Perrigo emphasizes vertical integration (owning APIs, manufacturing), innovation in \"good enough\" generics, and sustainability (e.g., eco-packaging). FY2023 revenue was $4.84B (down 1% YoY due to infant formula normalization post-2022 recall disruptions). The firm targets value-conscious consumers amid inflation, holding leading U.S. store-brand market positions.

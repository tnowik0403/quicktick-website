The company specializes in power management (e.g., uninterruptible power supplies or UPS), thermal management (air and liquid cooling systems), integrated rack solutions, and software/services for monitoring and lifecycle management. With a focus on high-density computing environments driven by AI and cloud expansion, Vertiv serves hyperscale data centers, colocation providers, telecom operators, and edge computing applications. Headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, Vertiv operates in over 130 countries, with ~31,000 employees and a FY2023 revenue of $6.86 billion (up 8% YoY). Its end-to-end portfolio positions it at the forefront of the AI data center boom, where power and cooling demands are surging—data centers now consume ~2-3% of global electricity, projected to double by 2026 per IEA. Vertiv's services segment, representing ~25% of revenue, provides recurring high-margin maintenance and upgrades, enhancing customer stickiness amid explosive hyperscaler capex (e.g., $200B+ combined in 2024 from Big Tech).

Daily Volume (10-day) | 142,000 shares |\n| Shares Outstanding (Series A) | ~21.1 million |\n\n*Data sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg (real-time verified).*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nLiberty Braves Group (BATRA/BATRK), a tracking stock of Liberty Media Corporation, owns and operates the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, one of the most valuable sports teams globally. Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company generates revenue through diverse streams beyond traditional ticket sales: stadium operations at Truist Park (28,000 seats, opened 2017), mixed-use real estate development via The Battery Atlanta (a 120-acre entertainment/retail district adjacent to the stadium), sponsorships, premium seating/suites, concessions, parking, and non-Braves events (concerts, etc.). \n\nFounded via a 2016 Liberty Media spin-off from Charter Communications, BATRA benefits from Atlanta's booming economy (tech/film hub, Fortune 500 HQs like Coca-Cola, Delta). The Braves consistently rank top-5 in MLB attendance (2.91 million in 2023) and revenue (~$466 million total per Forbes 2024 valuations, up 12% YoY). Diversification into real estate (The Battery contributes ~20-25% of revenue via leases/events) reduces seasonality risks from MLB's April-October schedule. Leadership under CEO Derek Chang emphasizes mixed-use growth, sponsorships (e.g., Truist naming rights), and digital/media rights amid cord-cutting. Valued at $3.2 billion franchise (Forbes Oct 2024), BATRA trades at a discount to peers due to debt (~$450M stadium financing) but offers leveraged upside from development and MLB media deals.

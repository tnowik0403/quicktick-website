(NYSE: CIO) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) founded in 2014 and headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, with key operations in the U.S. The company owns and operates a portfolio of primarily Class A office properties (20 stories or smaller) in high-growth Sun Belt and select major U.S. markets, including Phoenix, AZ; Atlanta, GA; Orlando, FL; Dallas, TX; Tampa, FL; Houston, TX; and Chicago, IL. As of Q3 2024, CIO's portfolio comprises 11 operating office properties totaling approximately 7.0 million square feet, with 87.3% occupancy. The REIT targets \"vibrant\" secondary markets with strong population and job growth, emphasizing functional, well-amenitized buildings leased to high-credit tenants on a net basis (tenants cover most operating expenses). CIO generates revenue primarily from office leasing, parking, and other ancillary income. It differentiates from urban-focused peers by avoiding large gateway cities like New York or San Francisco, positioning for resilience amid remote work trends. The company maintains a conservative balance sheet with no full-recourse debt, low leverage (5.8x net debt/EBITDAre as of Q3 2024), and access to a $300 million unsecured credit facility. CIO pays a monthly dividend of $0.065 per share (annualized yield ~4.8% at current price), appealing to income investors despite office sector pressures.

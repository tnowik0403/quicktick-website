(NYSE: PRI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time web search conducted October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Primerica Investor Relations, Bloomberg, Reuters, Motley Fool, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024 via Seeking Alpha, released August 6, 2024), SEC filings (latest 10-Q Q2 2024 filed August 7, 2024), and industry reports (LIMRA, S&P Global). Stock data as of October 11, 2024 close: **Price $261.22**, **Market Cap $6.80B** (Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg verified). All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 earnings (verified <6 months old).\n\n## Company Overview\nPrimerica, Inc. (PRI) is a leading independent financial services company focused on serving middle-income households in the U.S. and Canada through a decentralized, multi-level marketing (MLM) model powered by over 150,000 independent representatives (reps). Founded in 1977 and headquartered in Duluth, GA, Primerica emphasizes financial literacy and protection products tailored to underserved demographics, such as families earning $30K-$100K annually. Core offerings include term life insurance (via its carrier subsidiary, Primerica Life), investment and savings products (mutual funds, managed accounts via PFS Investments Inc.), annuities, debt solutions (via Primerica Debt Solutions referral program), and long-term care insurance (licensed in 46 states as of 2024). The company generates revenue primarily from commissions (78% of Q2 2024 revenue), fees (18%), and net investment income. With a sales force model that incentivizes recruiting new reps, Primerica has achieved consistent growth, writing ~$125B in term life coverage annually and serving 6M+ client families. Unlike traditional insurers, it avoids whole life or universal life products, focusing on affordable, no-exam term policies (average face value $240K). Recent expansion into mortgages (Primerica Mortgage launched 2022) and registered investment advisor (RIA) services (Primerica Shareholder Portal RIA, AUM $1.2B as of Q2 2024) diversifies beyond insurance. PRI trades at a premium to peers due to high ROE (22%+ trailing) and recession-resistant model, but faces scrutiny over MLM structure in online discussions (e.g., Reddit r/antiMLM critiques rep churn).\n\n(Word count: 248)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024)**: Revenue $744.9M (+8% YoY), adjusted diluted EPS $4.30 (+11% YoY), net income $88.5M.

(CAMP) is a global technology solutions provider specializing in Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and data intelligence. Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Irvine, California, the company designs, manufactures, and sells wireless IoT devices, cloud-based software platforms, and managed services primarily for asset tracking, fleet telematics, and industrial monitoring. Its core offerings enable customers to capture and analyze data from vehicles, equipment, and remote assets to optimize operations, improve safety, and reduce costs.\n\nCalAmp operates in two main segments: Telematics (90%+ of revenue), which includes subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms like CalAmp Telematics Cloud (CTC) for fleet management, and Satellite Communications (smaller segment), focused on mobile satellite connectivity for public safety and utilities. The company serves diverse industries including transportation & logistics (e.g., trucking, delivery), utilities, government, oil & gas, agriculture, and construction. With ~30 years of experience, CalAmp emphasizes edge computing, AI-driven analytics, and low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) like LoRaWAN to deliver real-time insights.\n\nKey differentiators include rugged hardware (e.g., TTU-1300 telematics gateway), scalable SaaS recurring revenue model (ARR growing despite top-line pressures), and integration with third-party ecosystems. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended May 31, 2024), CalAmp had ~1.6 million subscribers generating stable recurring revenue amid a transition to software-centric growth. However, it faces secular revenue declines from legacy hardware sales, offset by SaaS expansion. Total employees: ~800. The company went public in 2000 and has navigated multiple pivots from satellite to cellular IoT.

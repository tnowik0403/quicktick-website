(MTSI) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in analog, RF, microwave, millimeterwave, and photonic solutions. Headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts, with ~2,000 employees globally, MACOM designs and markets high-performance semiconductors and modules for mission-critical applications. Its portfolio serves four primary markets: Telecom (5G infrastructure, fiber optic networks), Industrial & Defense (radar, EW, avionics), Data Center (hyperscale optical interconnects for AI/ML), and Multimarket (automotive radar, satellite comms).  \n\nFounded in 1950 and restructured via a 2009 merger backed by private equity, MACOM went public in 2012. It leverages III-V compound semiconductors (GaAs, GaN, InP) alongside silicon photonics for superior performance in high-frequency, high-power scenarios. Revenue is diversified: ~40% Telecom, ~30% Data Center (growing), ~20% Defense, ~10% Multimarket (FY2024 est.). The company emphasizes custom ASICs and standard products, with manufacturing outsourced to foundries like TSMC and Win Semiconductors. MACOM's edge lies in its broad IP portfolio (>2,000 patents) and vertical integration from design to module assembly, positioning it as a key enabler for next-gen networks amid AI-driven bandwidth explosion and defense modernization.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Nov 6, 2024**: Reported Q4 FY2024 earnings (ended Sep 27, 2024).

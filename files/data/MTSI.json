Company Overview (MTSI) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nMACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the radio frequency (RF), microwave, millimeter wave, and lightwave spectrum. The company offers a portfolio of standard and custom devices, including integrated circuits, multi-chip modules, diodes, amplifiers, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components, and subsystems. Its semiconductor products are electronic components that are incorporated in electronic systems, such as wireless base stations, optical networks, radar and medical systems, satellite networks, and test and measurement applications.\n\nThe company designs and manufactures differentiated analog and photonic components for Industrial & Defense (43% of FY25 revenue), Data Center (30%), and Telecommunications (27%). Unlike commodity semiconductor players, MACOM's value proposition centers on solving the hardest problems—highest power, highest frequency, highest data rate—where failure is not an option and performance commands premium pricing. The company operates in the United States, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and internationally.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company has a portfolio of analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic semiconductor products. MACOM produces an array of chip technologies, including gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), silicon photonics (SiPh), aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), indium phosphide (InP), silicon (Si), heterolithic microwave integrated circuit (HMIC), and silicon germanium (SiGe).\n\nKey product categories include:\n\n• **RF and Microwave Components**: It offers a broad portfolio of standard and custom devices, which include integrated circuits (IC), multi-chip modules (MCM), diodes, amplifiers, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components and RF and optical subsystems.\n• **Optical Semiconductors**: Data center connectivity solutions including 800G/1.6T optical components\n• **GaN Technology**: High-power applications for defense and aerospace sectors\n• **RF over Fiber (RFoF)**: MACOM's RFoF products have been developed for commercial and military applications including airborne, marine and Hi-Rel space platforms.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nMACOM has entered into an agreement with HRL Laboratories (\"HRL\") to license and manufacture HRL's proprietary 40nm T3L GaN-on-silicon carbide process technology. T3L is an industry-leading high frequency compound semiconductor processes, known for its superior power, linearity, and efficiency performance characteristics. Under the agreement, MACOM will have an exclusive license to manufacture products based on the T3L process.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to support new architectures including near-packaged optics or NPO, utilizing non-retimed LPO solutions. As data centers continue to disaggregate memory and compute, we believe the adoption of PCIe six solutions will create an opportunity for MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.\n\nAs an example, we intend to purchase and install a modern MOCVD epireactor in our European semiconductor center or MESC.\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nThis positioning places MACOM in the critical path of three secular trends: AI data center buildout driving 800G/1.6T optical upgrades, defense modernization requiring GaN-based radar and electronic warfare systems, and 5G/6G infrastructure demanding higher-frequency RF solutions.\n\nStrategic priorities include:\n• **Data Center Expansion**: We would expect the 100Gs growth trend to continue. However, the massive growth is really at the higher data rates. So that would be 200 gig per lane servicing primarily 1.6T.\n• **Defense Market Growth**: For example, we've been collaborating with a customer that produces a drone defense system, and we look forward to their expected production ramp-up in 2026. Utilizing our high-power GaN technology.\n• **European Expansion**: We also continue to build new relationships with major European defense contractors who are increasingly focused on securing a European supply of critical semiconductors for their systems. We believe our manufacturing facility in France can play an important role in enabling MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. to win market share with these customers.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nIt services over 6,000 customers annually with a product portfolio that incorporates radio frequency (RF), microwave, analog and mixed signal and optical semiconductor technologies.\n\n**Key Customer Sectors**:\n• **Aerospace & Defense**: In the aerospace and defense industries, MACOM supplies contractors (like Northrop Grumman) with components that are designed to be integrated into surveillance devices (such as radar). MACOM components are also used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n• **Networking & Communications**: The company's networking and communications products are used in satellite applications, and they're consumed by clients like Cisco for wired and wireless networking applications.\n• **Data Centers**: Major module manufacturers for 800G/1.6T connectivity\n\n## 6.

(NYSE: MYRG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 17, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Closing Price**: $154.23  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.59 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $106.78 – $179.00  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 16.7  \n- **EV/EBITDA**: 10.2 (based on LTM figures)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMYR Group Inc. (MYRG) is a premier specialty contractor serving the energy infrastructure sector across the United States and Canada. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, the company operates through two main segments: Transmission & Distribution (T&D, ~70% of revenue) and Commercial & Industrial (C&I, ~30%). In T&D, MYR provides turnkey construction, smart grid technologies, and maintenance for high-voltage transmission lines, substations, and distribution networks, supporting utilities in grid modernization and renewables integration. The C&I segment focuses on electrical installations for data centers, EV charging infrastructure, solar farms, and industrial facilities. With approximately 8,500 employees and a fleet of specialized equipment, MYR benefits from long-term relationships with major utilities and exposure to secular trends like electrification, renewable energy transition (via Inflation Reduction Act), and AI-driven data center demand. The company reported record backlog of $4.6 billion as of June 30, 2024, underscoring robust demand amid U.S. infrastructure spending from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. MYR's scalable model, safety focus (EMR rating <1.0), and unionized workforce position it as a leader in a fragmented market, though it faces cyclicality tied to utility capex cycles.

Fundamentals support 15-20% EPS CAGR; undervalued vs. peers amid electrification megatrend.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $185 (20% upside) – Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($260M midpoint guidance, growing 15% to $300M in 2025) + 10% premium for backlog quality/moderate risk (beta 1.4). Suitable for growth portfolios; hold through Q3 earnings (Oct 31). \n\n*Sources: Company 10-Q/8-K (July 31, 2024), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Wood Mackenzie reports, DOE/IEA data.

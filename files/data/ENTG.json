(NASDAQ: ENTG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $107.92 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $16.22 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $81.13 - $141.30  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEntegris, Inc. is a leading global provider of advanced materials, process solutions, and specialty chemicals essential for manufacturing semiconductors, high-tech electronics, and life sciences applications. Headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts, and founded in 1966, the company operates through three main segments: Microcontamination Control (MC), which offers filtration and purification products to protect wafer purity; Advanced Materials Solutions (AMS), including advanced packaging materials like die attach films and underfill encapsulants; and Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials (SCEM), encompassing CMP slurries, wafer cleaning solutions, and engineered materials for deposition processes.  \n\nEntegris serves the semiconductor supply chain, enabling yield improvement and process efficiency amid the shift to advanced nodes (e.g., 3nm/2nm) and heterogeneous integration in AI, 5G, and EVs. With ~8,000 employees across 20+ countries, it holds a strong position in high-purity materials, critical for ~90% of leading-edge logic and memory fabs. Recent acquisitions like CMC Materials (July 2022, $6.7B) have expanded its portfolio into advanced planarization and packaging, positioning it for growth in HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) and CoWoS packaging trends. FY2023 revenue was $3.3B, with ~70% from semiconductors. The company benefits from secular tailwinds in AI-driven chip demand but faces cyclicality tied to fab utilization rates.

concerns over China revenue (~25% of sales) amid export curbs.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **AI and Advanced Packaging Focus**: Investing $1.5B+ in capex (2024-2026) for HBM/CoWoS materials; targeting 20-25% CAGR in packaging revenue.\n- **Capacity Expansion**: New fabs in Colorado (dielectrics, 2025 online) and Taiwan (slurries/purification, Q4 2024).\n- **R&D Investment**: 10-12% of revenue (~$350M in 2024); 500+ patents filed annually, emphasizing EUV/3D packaging.\n- **Margin Expansion**: Aim for 30%+ non-GAAP gross margins by 2026 via mix shift to high-value AMS/SCEM (currently ~28%).\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Strong AI/HBM backlog (e.g., TSMC/Nvidia ramps); CMC integration synergies ($100M+ annual savings achieved). | Inventory normalization delaying orders; Q2 AMS weakness. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Semiconductor capex boom ($100B+ in 2024, per SEMI); AI chip demand (HBM market to $20B by 2028, per Yole). | China fab slowdown (utilization ~70%); potential US-China trade escalation. |\n| **Macro** | CHIPS Act subsidies ($39B grants); EV/5G growth. | High interest rates pressuring fab budgets; cyclical downturn risks if AI hype cools. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Microcontamination Control (46% of 2023 revenue)**: Point-of-use filters, gas purification, wafer transport (e.g., FOUPs).\n- **Advanced Materials Solutions (32%)**: Photoresists, dielectrics, advanced packaging (e.g., Poron XRD foams).\n- **Specialty Chemicals & Engineered Materials (22%)**: CMP slurries (Optiplane), wet chemicals, yield enhancement fluids.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **HBM3/HBM4 Solutions (Launch Q3 2024)**: Thermal interface materials and underfills for Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.\n- **EUV Pod Cleaners (Q2 2024 rollout)**: Reduces EUV contamination by 50% for ASML tools.\n- **Colorado Fab (2025)**: $500M investment for low-k dielectrics targeting 2nm nodes.\n- **Taiwan Slurry Plant (Q4 2024)**: $200M for high-selectivity CMP fluids.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- Semiconductor filtration/purification: ~35-40% (leader, per company filings and VLSI Research).\n- CMP slurries: ~25% post-CMC (up from 10% pre-acquisition).\n- Wafer shippers/handling: ~50% global.\n- Advanced packaging materials: ~15-20% (growing via CMC).\n\n**Forecast**: Market share gains to 40%+ in filtration/HBM by 2026 (AI-driven); flat/slight decline in legacy memory if NAND weakens.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric | ENTG | Applied Materials (AMAT) | Lam Research (LRCX) | DuPont (DD) - Electronics |\n|--------|------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **2023 Revenue** | $3.3B | $26.5B | $17.4B | $5.5B (total) |\n| **Semicon %** | 70% | 75% | 100% | 20% |\n| **P/E (Fwd)** | 28x | 22x | 24x | 18x |\n| **Strengths** | Materials niche, high margins (28% gross) | Equipment leader, broad AI exposure | Etch/deposition focus | Chemicals breadth |\n| **Weaknesses** | Cyclical, China exposure | Capex-tied | Similar cyclicality | Less semicon purity |\n| **YTD Return** | -15% | +25% | +10% | +5% |\n\nENTG trades at premium EV/EBITDA (~20x fwd) vs. peers (~15x) due to growth outlook.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: TSMC (HBM/CoWoS qualified supplier, 2024);

Rationale: AI/HBM tailwinds outweigh cyclical risks; Q3 guide implies 15%+ FY24 growth acceleration. Fundamentals solid post-CMC digestion; undervalued vs. 25-30% EPS CAGR to 2027.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $145** (35% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 4% terminal growth), incorporating $1B FCF by 2026 and 30% margins. Targets strong growth portfolios with moderate risk (beta 1.4). Entry below $110 ideal. \n\n*Sources: Company 10-Q (Aug 2024), Q2 Earnings Transcript (Seeking Alpha), SEMI.org, Yole Group reports (Sep 2024), Yahoo Finance (real-time), Nasdaq filings.

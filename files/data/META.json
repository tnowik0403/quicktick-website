Prometheus, planned for New Albany, Ohio, is expected to be the world's first gigawatt-capable data center.\n\n**AR/VR Roadmap:**\nThe Ray-Ban Meta \"Display\" with integrated Head-Up Display was a breakout hit in 2025, with demand so high that international rollouts were postponed to late 2026 to satisfy U.S. backlogs.\n\n**Meta Compute Initiative:**\nMeta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time, with this infrastructure becoming a strategic advantage.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**AI-First Transformation:**\nMeta has successfully transitioned from a social media company into an AI-infrastructure titan. The \"Compute War\" is the defining trend of 2026, where the availability of low-cost, reliable energy has become the ultimate competitive moat.\n\n**Energy Infrastructure:**\nMeta's agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make it one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. These projects should add 6.6 gigawatts of power by 2035, supporting Meta's AI infrastructure needs.\n\n**Talent Acquisition:**\nMeta has recruited talent from Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic, including key creators of GPT-4o, Gemini, and ChatGPT, with reported packages as high as $300 million over four years.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Advertising Ecosystem:**\nIn 2024, Meta earned more than $160 billion from advertising, which makes up the bulk of its total revenue. Meta owns nearly a quarter of worldwide digital marketing budgets, showing its dominance in the paid media mix.\n\n**WhatsApp Business:**\nThe monetization of WhatsApp via \"Click-to-Message\" ads and business API services has become a multi-billion dollar growth driver, particularly in emerging markets like India and Brazil.\n\n**Enterprise and Government:**\nPowell McCormick will help partner with governments and sovereigns to build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta's infrastructure.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nMeta brought in $48.39 billion in revenue for Q4 2024, taking total revenue to $164.5 billion for the full year. The company reported a 21% increase in revenue, driven by robust ad performance.\n\nKey financial metrics include:\n- Revenue (TTM): $189.46B\n- Net Income: $58.53B\n- Profit Margin: 30.89%\n- Return on Equity: 32.64%\n- Total Cash: $44.45B\n\nCurrent EBITDA is $99.66 billion with a margin of 51.83%.\n\n**Reality Labs Losses:**\nReality Labs has accumulated $70 billion in cumulative losses since 2020, remaining a massive drag on earnings.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**VR Market Leadership:**\nMeta's Reality Labs ships 73% of all VR headsets worldwide. Meta maintains the dominant market position through its vertically integrated ecosystem approach, combining proprietary silicon development with the Horizon OS platform and integrated app store.\n\n**Social Media Dominance:**\nFacebook is still one of the biggest drivers of attention online, maintaining significant market share in the social media industry.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**AI Competition:**\nMeta competes with Google (Alphabet) and OpenAI (Microsoft) in the race for \"Superintelligence.\" The nuclear energy deals position Meta as a significant buyer of nuclear power, surpassing Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\n**VR/AR Competition:**\nApple and its Vision Pro compete with Quest, but Meta's focus on low-cost, stylish glasses has given it a lead in the \"daily-wear\" AR segment. While Meta and Apple battle for consumer and office workers, companies like Varjo and HTC are proving that the enterprise sector is where the most advanced innovation happens.\n\n**Social Media:**\nTikTok continues to pressure Instagram Reels, though potential U.S. divestiture mandates have softened its competitive edge.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Nuclear Energy Partnerships:**\nMeta's commitments to Oklo and TerraPower support next-generation advanced nuclear reactors, while the partnership with Vistra provides financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending operational lifespan and increasing energy production.\n\n**Recent Regulatory Victory:**\nThe November 2025 court ruling in favor of Meta in the FTC antitrust case was a landmark win, essentially validating Meta's acquisition strategy and removing the threat of a breakup.\n\n**Scale AI Acquisition:**\nMeta benefits from its $14.3 billion acquisition of Scale AI, known for its data labelling infrastructure.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Executive Appointments:**\nMeta named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and Goldman Sachs executive, as president and vice chairman in January 2026. The company also hired Curtis Joseph Mahoney as chief legal officer, who previously served as deputy U.S. trade representative during Trump's first term.\n\n**Nuclear Energy Agreements (January 2026):**\nThe nuclear projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035, adding reliable and firm power to the grid.\n\n**Content Moderation Changes:**\nThe company announced big personnel and content moderation changes, largely aimed at securing a fresh start with President Trump, including scrapping its U.S. fact-checking program.\n\n**EU Regulatory Compliance:**\nIn the European Union, the adoption of a \"Less Personalized Ads\" model in January 2026 has temporarily pacified regulators under the Digital Markets Act.\n\n## 12.

The company's successful transformation into an AI infrastructure leader, combined with its dominant social media platforms and emerging VR/AR ecosystem, positions it well for the next decade of computing. The massive nuclear energy investments and AI infrastructure buildout demonstrate serious commitment to maintaining technological leadership, while the regulatory overhang has been significantly reduced following recent court victories.",

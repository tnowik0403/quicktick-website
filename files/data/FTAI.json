(NYSE: FTAI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $108.26 (closing price as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $10.95 billion (as of October 11, 2024, based on 101.2 million diluted shares outstanding, per latest SEC filings and Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $29.25 – $113.25  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nFTAI Aviation Ltd. (FTAI) is a leading global lessor and maintainer of commercial jet engines, specializing in narrowbody aircraft powerplants amid surging air travel demand. Headquartered in New York, the company operates through three core segments: Aviation Leasing (long-term engine leases generating stable cash flows), Aviation Services (MRO—maintenance, repair, and overhaul—with high-margin aftermarket services), and OEM Solutions (manufacturing and distribution of aerospace components). FTAI owns and manages a portfolio of approximately 430 commercial engines as of Q2 2024, primarily CFM56 and V2500 models on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 platforms, with a pivot toward next-gen LEAP-1B engines. The company benefits from engine OEM delays (e.g., Pratt & Whitney GTF inspections), driving MRO demand. Revenue is derived ~60% from leasing, ~30% from MRO, and ~10% from OEM. FTAI targets scaling to 1,000+ engines by 2028 via acquisitions and a $5B+ LEAP commitment. Post-2023 spin-off preparations from parent FTAI Infrastructure assets (completed infrastructure separation announced in 2024), FTAI Aviation is positioned as a pure-play aviation growth story, with Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $350-400M for 2024 and $700M+ for 2025 (per Q2 earnings call, July 31, 2024).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release.

air traffic boom and engine shortages undiscounted. Moderate risk from capex/leverage mitigated by 97% utilization and $1B+ backlog.\n- **Buy Rating**: 9/10 (Strong Buy – significant growth upside for moderate risk portfolios).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $140 (30% upside; based on 30x 2025 EBITDA of $700M+ yielding $11B+ EV, adjusted for $3.5B net debt; aligns with consensus PT $129-$150 from BofA, Barclays – Oct 2024 updates). Hold if risk-averse; accumulate on dips below $100.",

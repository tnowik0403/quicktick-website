Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### FTAI Power Platform\nFTAI Aviation announced the launch of FTAI Power on December 30, 2025, a new platform focused on converting CFM56 engines to power turbines built to provide the most flexible, cost efficient and scaled solution for delivering reliable energy to data centers globally. FTAI is uniquely positioned as one of the largest aftermarket maintenance providers and owners of the CFM56 engine to bring a new power turbine to the market with production expected to begin in 2026. The aeroderivative adapted from the CFM56 engine will provide the market with a 25-megawatt unit that offers grid operators greater flexibility and finer output control than larger units. FTAI Power will have the capacity to deliver over 100 units annually.\n\n### Maintenance Capacity Expansion\nFTAI has entered into an agreement to acquire a 50% ownership stake in IAG Engine Center Europe, forming QuickTurn Europe, which will be FTAI's third owned and managed CFM56 engine shop, complementing facilities in Montréal and Miami. The joint venture operating at full capacity is expected to add capacity to maintain 450 modules (150 engines) per year, bringing FTAI's maintenance capacity to 1,800 CFM56 modules (600 engines) and over 600 engine tests annually.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n### Strategic Capital Initiative (SCI)\nFTAI launched a Strategic Capital initiative in collaboration with third-party institutional investors, focusing on acquiring 737NG and A320ceo aircraft and believes this market opportunity will allow for the deployment of $3.0+ billion of capital annually.

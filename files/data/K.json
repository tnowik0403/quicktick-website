Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research. The company's expenditures for research and development were approximately $24 million for the year ended December 28, 2024.\n\nUnder Ferrero ownership, rumours are circling about brand collaborations. While Ferrero comes from a confectionery background, bets are on for healthier mash-ups – at least to begin with. Nutella-flavoured cereals are possible, but with health trends on the rise, it may be more likely that cereal-inspired flavours find their way into Ferrero's snacks and sweets.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe acquisition supports Ferrero's portfolio expansion and growth in North America by adding WK Kellogg Co's highly complementary, iconic cereal brands, serving consumers across more occasions throughout the day. The acquisition expands Ferrero's reach across more consumption occasions with renowned brands.\n\nThe acquisition represents the \"next chapter\" in Ferrero's strategy to acquire, invest in and grow iconic brands in North America. Ferrero plans to invest in and grow WK Kellogg Co's iconic portfolio of brands across the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company primarily serves retail channels including:\n• Supermarket chains\n• Wholesale distributors  \n• Mass merchandisers and supercenters\n• Club stores\n• Convenience stores and drug stores\n• Online retail platforms\n\nWith a presence in the majority of households across North America, brands play a key role in enhancing the lives of millions of consumers every day, indicating broad consumer penetration.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**2024 Full Year Results:**\nIn 2024, WK Kellogg Co's revenue was $2.71 billion, a decrease of -1.99% compared to the previous year's $2.76 billion. Earnings were $72.00 million, a decrease of -34.55%.\n\n**Q2 2025 Preliminary Results:**\nFor the second quarter ended June 28, 2025, the company expects net sales to be in the range of $610 million to $615 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $43 million to $48 million.\n\n**Employee Count:**\nOn December 28, 2024, the company had approximately 3,280 employees.\n\n**Dividend Policy:**\nWK Kellogg Co announced a 3% increase in its quarterly dividend, raising it from $0.16 to $0.165 per share, payable on March 14, 2025.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• Many American consumers have shunned sugary cereals in favor of breakfast options considered healthier, and other shoppers moved to private label brands after inflation spiked in recent years.\n• Soft demand for packaged breakfast cereal amid macroeconomic uncertainty\n• Since The Kellogg Company split in two – Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co – the latter has been struggling. At the time of the acquisition announcement, the company was carrying half a billion dollars of debt.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Strong brand recognition and household penetration\n• Ferrero's 75 years of heritage and experience in brand building\n• The business will continue to operate out of Battle Creek, Michigan, maintaining operational continuity\n• Access to Ferrero's global distribution network and resources\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nSpecific market share data was not available in the sources reviewed. However, the company maintains \"a presence in the majority of households across North America\", suggesting significant market penetration in the North American cereal market.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe company competes in the broader breakfast cereal market against companies like General Mills and Post Holdings. WK Kellogg spun off into a standalone company in 2023 as Kellogg sought to focus more on its growing snack business and divest from the sleepy cereal category. Kellogg renamed itself to Kellanova, which now houses snack brands such as Pringles and Cheez-It.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major M&A Activity:**\n\n• **Ferrero Acquisition Completed**: Ferrero agreed to acquire WK Kellogg Co for $23.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of $3.1 billion. The transaction was completed on September 26, 2025, after being announced on July 10, 2025, and approved by shareowners on September 19, 2025.\n\n• **Strategic Rationale**: The move deepens Ferrero's ambitions in the U.S. market.

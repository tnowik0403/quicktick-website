Incorporated in 1980 and headquartered in Midland, Texas, Mexco holds interests in approximately 6,000 net acres, with a portfolio emphasizing mature properties for low-risk development and enhanced recovery. The company operates through two segments: Oil and Gas Exploration, which involves leasing and drilling new wells, and Land Management, which generates fee-based revenue from leasing non-operated mineral and royalty interests to third parties.\n\nMexco's strategy centers on high-margin, operated vertical wells in the Permian, supplemented by non-operated working interests and overriding royalty interests (ORRIs). As of its latest filings, it produces around 250-300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), with ~80% oil-weighted production. The company avoids high-cost horizontal drilling, prioritizing capital efficiency amid volatile commodity prices. Recent emphasis has been on deleveraging its balance sheet (now debt-free) and returning capital via dividends (quarterly payouts initiated in 2023). Mexco benefits from the Permian's prolific geology but faces scale limitations as a micro-cap player. With a market cap under $25M, it trades at a premium to net asset value (NAV) due to Permian exposure, though liquidity is low (avg. daily volume ~20K shares).

Mexco ~0.005% U.S. onshore oil output (EIA data).\n- **Forecast**: Modest growth to 350 BOE/d by 2026 (+40%), implying stable micro-share. Decline risk if oil < $60/bbl.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Company (Ticker) | Market Cap | Prod. (BOE/d) | EV/BOE | Key Diff. |\n|------------------|------------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **MXC**         | $22M      | 243          | ~$40K | Vertical focus, dividends. |\n| SM Energy (SM)  | $5.2B     | 180K         | $25K  | Horizontal scale, higher growth. |\n| Par Pacific (PARR) | $1.1B  | 100K         | $15K  | Refining integration. |\n| Vital Energy (VTLE) | $1.4B | 115K       | $20K  | Larger Permian horizontal ops. |\n\nMXC trades at premium EV/BOE due to purity but lags scale.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Non-op with Permian operators (e.g., undisclosed majors in Reeves Co.).\n- **M&A**: Acquired 200 net acres ORRIs in Q4 FY2024 (March 2024, $0.5M); no major deals since.\n- **Clients**: Fee revenue from lessees like Chevron, Occidental (non-op partners); production sold to local Permian midstream (e.g., Targa Resources).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Nikhil Gala (since 2019) track record of 300% stock return; strong ESG via low-flare ops.\n- **Risks**: Commodity beta (beta 1.8); dilution risk from shelf.\n- **Catalysts**: Q2 earnings Nov 2024; oil >$75/bbl rally.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold with upside bias). Strong Permian tailwinds, dividends, and debt-free status support growth in moderate risk portfolio, but micro-cap volatility caps to \"hold\" core.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $14.50 (29% upside). Based on 6x FY2025 EV/EBITDA (~$4M est. EBITDA), 1.2x NAV ($12/share from Ryder Scott reserve report Jan 2024), discounted 10% for size/liquidity. Assumes WTI $72/bbl avg.",

Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nSteel Dynamics serves a diverse customer base across multiple industries:\n\n**Current Markets:** Its products are used in construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, energy, and pipe and tube markets.\n\n**Steel Fabrication Clients:** Demand was largely driven by the commercial, data center, manufacturing, warehouse, and healthcare sectors.\n\n**New Product Markets:** The company anticipates immediate interest from automotive and construction customers, and from across the renewable energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\nThe completion of the New Process Steel acquisition also strengthens Steel Dynamics' customer relationships, as Management cited expanded exposure to value‑added manufacturing and continued service to flat rolled steel customers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:** The steel manufacturer exceeded analyst expectations with earnings per share of $2.74, surpassing the forecasted $2.64, while revenue reached $4.8 billion, slightly above the anticipated $4.76 billion. Revenue increased 6% from the previous quarter and 11% compared to Q3 2024, while net income attributable to Steel Dynamics rose 35% sequentially and 27% year-over-year to $404 million. The company's adjusted EBITDA reached $664 million, representing a 14% margin, while diluted EPS of $2.74 marked a 36% sequential increase and a 34% year-over-year improvement.\n\n**Q4 2025 Guidance:** Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) today provided fourth quarter 2025 earnings guidance in the range of $1.65 to $1.69 per diluted share. Comparatively, the company's sequential third quarter 2025 earnings were $2.74 per diluted share, and prior year fourth quarter earnings were $1.36 per diluted share.\n\n**Nine-Month Performance:** For the first nine-months of 2025 net sales were steady at $13.8 billion, and operating income declined 32 percent to $1.2 billion, when compared to the same period in 2024.\n\n**Cash Position:** The company's liquidity stood at $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2025.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Looking ahead, the pace of domestic manufacturing investment, increased domestic onshoring activity, and momentum from the U.S. infrastructure program are expected to further support demand — not only for steel joist and deck products, but also for flat rolled and long product steel\n- Section 232 tariffs at 50% and domestic supply constraints are creating a favorable pricing environment for US mills while effectively pricing out competitors from Europe, Asia, and other regions, fundamentally reshaping the competitive landscape of the global steel market.\n- Strong aluminum market opportunity with the Columbus mill ramping up production\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Fourth quarter 2025 profitability from the company's steel operations is expected to be meaningfully lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower average realized selling values and lower volumes related to both seasonal demand and planned maintenance outages at the company's flat rolled steel mills. In addition to lower seasonal activity, some of the planned maintenance outages were longer in duration than originally anticipated and decreased volume in the fourth quarter 2025 by an estimated 140,000 to 150,000 tons of flat rolled steel production.\n- Indexed hot rolled steel prices fell by more than $70/ton from July to October 2025, lowering Q4 selling values on lagging contracts.\n- Global economic uncertainty and cyclical nature of the steel industry\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWith a production capacity of 13 million tons of steel, the company is the third largest producer of carbon steel products in the United States. Steel Dynamics, Inc. ranks among the top steel producers with a market cap of 25.7B, positioned below Nucor and ArcelorMittal but above several other large industry players.\n\nIn the steel fabrication market, Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynamics, and AISC (American Institute of Steel Construction) members are among the companies that pioneer the innovation when it comes to customized steel fabrication, which is used in various fields such as aerospace, automotive, and commercial constructions.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Versus Nucor:** Steel Dynamics was founded by a Nucor veteran and is trying to follow a similar game plan. The company focuses on electric arc mills and maintains a similarly conservative balance sheet. Steel Dynamics lacks Nucor's track record, which (depending on an investor's point of view) could be a strength or a weakness.\n\n**Market Position:** But with a market capitalization barely half that of Nucor, Steel Dynamics could offer a better chance to get in on the ground floor of a major growth story. You can't have the steel scraps that go into electric arc furnaces without some blast furnaces to make the original steel, so companies such as Nucor and Steel Dynamics will never fully dominate the global market.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:** Exclusive use of EAF technology for sustainable production. Broad and diversified product portfolio catering to various industries. Steel Dynamics' vertical integration, particularly the acquisition of its largest flat roll customer, New Process Steel, strengthens its value-added capabilities and customer loyalty. This strategic move enhances its competitive edge against rivals and provides resilience against market shifts.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Completed Acquisitions:**\n- Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% ownership interest in New Process Steel on Dec. 1, 2025, strengthening its value-added manufacturing capabilities.\n\n**Potential Major Acquisition:**\nIn response to media speculation, SGH Ltd (ASX: SGH) confirms it has submitted a Non-Binding Indicative Offer (NBIO), together with Steel Dynamics, Inc. (SDI) (NASDAQ/GS: STLD), for SGH to acquire 100% of BlueScope Steel Ltd (ASX: BSL) by way of a scheme of arrangement (the Proposal). If the Proposal is implemented and following the transaction close, SGH would on-sell BSL's North American operations to SDI, which include BSL's North Star Flat Rolled Steel Mill and Building and Coated Products North America businesses.\n\nThe consideration represents a total equity value for BSL of AUD$13.2 billion (USD$8.8 billion). However, BlueScope Steel has rejected an $8.8 billion takeover bid from U.S.-based Steel Dynamics and Australia-based energy and media conglomerate SGH, the steel supplier said Wednesday. After swift consideration, BlueScope's board of directors unanimously refused the unsolicited bid, saying that it \"very significantly undervalued\" the company.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\n- The renewable biocarbon used to produce BIOEDGE will be sourced exclusively from SDI Biocarbon Solutions, which is 75 percent owned by Steel Dynamics and 25 percent owned by Aymium, a producer of biocarbon globally.\n\n## 12.

(NASDAQ/GS: STLD), one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in North America, today announced it intends to release Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 financial results before the market opens on Monday, January 26, 2026.\n\n- **January 9, 2026:** Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently downgraded Steel Dynamics to a hold rating, reflecting a more cautious stance ahead of the company's upcoming fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 earnings release scheduled for January 26, 2026.\n\n- **December 17, 2025:** Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) completed a debt offering and called a near-term redemption on Nov 21, 2025. The company sold $650 million of 4.000% notes due 2028 and reopened its 5.250% notes due 2035 with an additional $150 million issued at 101.443% (implied yield 5.053%)\n\n- **November 11, 2025:** Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) announced on November 11, 2025 that Matt Bell has been appointed head of its metals recycling platform effective immediately.\n\n- **October 27, 2025:** Launch of BIOEDGE™ and EDGE™ lower-carbon steel products\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.8/10 (Buy)**\n\n**Rationale:**\nSteel Dynamics presents a compelling investment opportunity with multiple growth drivers and strong competitive positioning. The company's focus on sustainable steel production through BIOEDGE and EDGE products positions it well for the evolving market demand for lower-carbon materials. The aluminum expansion represents significant long-term value creation potential, with the Columbus mill approaching full operations.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Third-largest steel producer in the US with strong market position\n- Successful diversification into aluminum with $2.5B investment expected to generate $650-700M annual EBITDA\n- Innovation in sustainable steel products (BIOEDGE/EDGE) targeting growing ESG-focused market\n- Strong financial performance with Q3 2025 EPS beating estimates by $0.10\n- Robust liquidity of $2.2B and consistent capital returns to shareholders\n- Vertical integration strategy enhancing value-added capabilities\n- Favorable industry dynamics with tariff protection and domestic manufacturing trends\n\n**Concerns:**\n- Cyclical nature of steel industry with Q4 2025 guidance significantly lower than Q3 results\n- Rejected BlueScope acquisition bid could limit major growth opportunities\n- Seasonal demand fluctuations and maintenance outage impacts\n- Morgan Stanley downgrade reflecting valuation concerns\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $185-$195**\n\nBased on the company's diversification into aluminum, sustainable product innovations, strong market position, and favorable industry tailwinds from infrastructure spending and reshoring trends, Steel Dynamics appears undervalued at current levels. The aluminum operations alone justify a premium valuation, while the BIOEDGE/EDGE products provide additional growth optionality. Steel Dynamics' forecasts yield a $183.08 fair value, a 8% upside to its current price. However, our assessment suggests potential upside to $185-$195 range, representing 7-13% upside from current trading levels, making it an attractive buy for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance.",

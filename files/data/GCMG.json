Secondaries niche (~$150B market): ~5-7% (top 10 player). Private credit: <1% (vs. Ares/Owl Rock dominance).\n- **Forecast:** FEAUM growth 9-12% annually → market share stable-to-slight gain (0.25-0.3% by 2026) via niches; secondaries share +1-2ppt on Fund V. Downside risk if rates >5% (exits slow).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | GCMG          | Hamilton Lane (HLMN) | StepStone (STEP) | BlackRock Privates |\n|----------------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Fee-Earning AUM**       | $29.5B       | $52B                | $45B            | $150B+            |\n| **Revenue YoY Growth**    | +12%         | +25%                | +18%            | +30% (est)        |\n| **FRE Margins**           | 91%          | 85%                 | 88%             | 80% (est)         |\n| **EV/FRE Multiple (Fwd)** | 10.2x        | 16x                 | 14x             | 20x+              |\n| **YTD Stock Perf.**       | +12%         | +25%                | -5%             | N/A (private)     |\n\n*GCMG trades at discount on scale but matches margins; outperforms STEP on growth.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships:** Sourced via 950+ GPs (e.g., co-invest with KKR/Blackstone); RIA platforms (e.g., Schwab integration for evergreens).\n- **M&A:** None major since 2021 (acquired Lighthouse Investment Partners); focus organic. Watching GP stakes targets.\n- **Major Clients:** CalPERS/CalSTRS (multi-B mandates), UK LGPS pools, Abu Dhabi IW ($1B+ each); 55% FEAUM customized. Potential: Japanese SWFs (pipeline), US RIAs via evergreens.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG Integration:** 80% funds with ESG screens; net-zero target 2050.\n- **Management:** CEO Michael Sacks (co-founder) 90% insider ownership alignment.\n- **Risks:** 20% revenue performance-fee dependent; illiquid AUM exposure.\n- **Moat:** Proprietary deal flow (20k opps/yr), 50+ yr track record (15% net IRR since inception).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy for Growth Upside)**  \n  Rationale: Undervalued at 10x fwd FRE (peers 14-16x) with 12-15% FRE growth, niche tailwinds in secondaries/credit, and evergreen catalysts. Moderate risk (high FRE stability offsets rate sensitivity). Portfolio fit: 20-30% upside potential in 12 months on execution.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $14.50**  \n  (DCF: 12% growth/8% discount → $14-15; comps-adjusted 13x 2025 FRE $110M → $14.30. Assumes 10% FEAUM growth, stable macros.)  \n  *Upside: 30% from $11.15; Hold if rates spike >5.5%.*",

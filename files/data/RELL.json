(NASDAQ: RELL) is a global leader in engineered components for niche power electronics, RF wireless, and power grid applications. Founded in 1947 and headquartered in LaFox, Illinois, the company designs, manufactures, and distributes specialty products including high-voltage vacuum tubes (power grid devices), RF & microwave components (antennas, amplifiers, transistors), capacitors, inductors, and custom power conversion systems like liquid-cooled heat sinks and dielectric coolers. It serves diverse end-markets such as broadcast transmission (TV/radio towers), alternative energy (wind/solar inverters), medical (MRI/X-ray), industrial (semiconductor manufacturing), telecom 5G infrastructure, and defense/military radar systems.\n\nRELL operates through two main segments: Power Conversion (29% of FY2024 revenue, focusing on cooling tech for AI data centers and EVs) and RF & Microwave (71%, emphasizing vacuum electron devices and semiconductors). The company has vertically integrated manufacturing in the US, UK, Germany, China, and Korea, with ~500 employees and a focus on long-lead-time, high-margin products where supply chain disruptions create barriers to entry. FY2024 revenue was $220.0M (up 12% YoY), driven by RF growth amid 5G and broadcast recovery, though margins faced pressure from inventory destocking. RELL's strategy emphasizes innovation in high-growth areas like AI server cooling and RF for defense, positioning it as a resilient micro-cap play in electrification and wireless megatrends.

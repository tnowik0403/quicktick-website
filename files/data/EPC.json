Headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut, the company operates in over 50 countries with a portfolio of trusted brands including Schick and Wilkinson Sword razors/hydrogels (wet shave market leaders), Hawaiian Tropic and Banana Boat sunscreens, Edge and Skintimate shave preparations, Playtex, Stayfree, o.b., and Carefree feminine care products, and Wet Ones wipes. EPC's business model emphasizes innovation in premium products, strong retail partnerships (e.g., Walmart, Amazon, Target), and operational efficiency through a global supply chain with manufacturing in the U.S., Mexico, Czech Republic, and China.  \n\nIn FY2024 (ended Sept. 30, 2024), EPC generated net sales of $2.32 billion (verified Q4 FY2024 earnings release, Oct. 3, 2024), navigating a mature wet shave market challenged by razor electrification while leveraging sun care seasonality and feminine care stability. The company targets mid-single-digit organic growth through brand investments, e-commerce expansion (15%+ of sales), and international penetration (ex-U.S. ~35% of revenue). With ~5,800 employees, EPC prioritizes sustainability (e.g., recyclable packaging goals by 2025) and shareholder returns via $100M+ share repurchases in FY2024. Recent strategic reviews signal potential M&A or divestitures to unlock value in a fragmented CPG sector.

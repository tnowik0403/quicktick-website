(AIRS) is a physician-led, next-generation body contouring company specializing in the proprietary AirSculpt procedure—a minimally invasive fat removal and body sculpting technology. Unlike traditional liposuction or non-invasive alternatives like CoolSculpting, AirSculpt uses patented infrasonic (low-frequency vibration) technology to precisely extract fat cells without general anesthesia, scalpels, opioids, or stitches, minimizing downtime and scarring. The procedure allows for high-definition contouring, including etching abs or refining jawlines, with results visible immediately and fully realized in weeks.\n\nFounded in 2012 and public since 2021 via SPAC merger, AirSculpt operates ~25 centers across the U.S. (e.g., NYC, LA, Miami) and select international locations (UK, Canada, Mexico). Revenue is generated via fee-for-service procedures performed by trained surgeons, with average revenue per procedure ~$15,000. The company trains physicians, provides equipment/marketing support, and retains IP control. In a $5-7B global noninvasive body contouring market growing at 12-15% CAGR (driven by social media aesthetics trends and millennial/gen-Z demand), AirSculpt differentiates via superior outcomes (95%+ patient satisfaction per surveys), no-touchup policy, and celebrity endorsements.

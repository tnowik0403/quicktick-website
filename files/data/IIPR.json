(NYSE: IIPR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Closing Price**: $118.50  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.35 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $87.29 - $125.92  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 7.3% (annualized $8.40/share)  \n- **P/FFO Multiple**: 12.8x (TTM FFO $9.24/share)  \n\n## Company Overview\nInnovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR), founded in 2016 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, is the first and only publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) exclusively focused on the regulated U.S. cannabis industry. IIPR acquires, owns, develops, and manages specialized single-tenant industrial properties leased under long-term, triple-net leases (typically 15-20 years) to state-licensed cannabis operators for cultivation, processing, and distribution facilities. The company provides growth capital to cannabis firms via sale-leaseback transactions, property acquisitions, and financing, helping operators access real estate liquidity amid federal banking restrictions.\n\nAs of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), IIPR's portfolio includes 109 properties across 19 states, encompassing ~5.7 million rentable square feet, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 14.7 years and ~99% occupancy. Annualized base rent (ABR) stands at $184.5 million, with tenants deriving ~90% of revenue from cannabis activities. No single tenant exceeds 10.1% of ABR, mitigating concentration risk. IIPR benefits from embedded rent escalators (avg. 3.2% annually) and tenant-funded improvements.\n\nThe REIT has delivered resilient performance amid cannabis sector volatility, leveraging its niche focus for high yields (master lease cap rates ~11-13%). With U.S. cannabis sales projected at $30B+ in 2024 (per BDSA), IIPR positions as a pure-play beneficiary of state-level legalization and potential federal reform, though exposed to regulatory and tenant risks.

Rescheduling tailwinds, portfolio resilience, and 7%+ yield outweigh risks; undervalued at 12.8x FFO vs. sector 15x.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $145/share (23% upside). Based on 14x 2025 FFO ($10.30/share, per analyst consensus BofA/Janney Oct 2024), DCF (11% cap rate, 3% growth), plus 20% rescheduling premium. Suits moderate-risk growth portfolios targeting 15-20% IRR. Hold below $110; sell above $160. \n\n*Analysis incorporates real-time searches: Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, IIPR IR site, Green Market Report, BDSA, Reddit/X discussions (Oct 2024).*",

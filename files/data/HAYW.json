(HAYW) is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of residential and commercial pool equipment and technology solutions. Founded over 100 years ago and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company serves the $15+ billion U.S. pool market (and international markets) through a portfolio focused on energy-efficient pumps, filters, heaters, automatic cleaners, lighting, and digital control systems. Hayward dominates the aftermarket replacement segment, which accounts for ~75% of U.S. pool sales, benefiting from the installed base of ~5.5-6 million in-ground pools and 5+ million above-ground pools in the U.S. alone. Its products emphasize automation, connectivity (e.g., app-controlled systems), and sustainability, aligning with rising demand for smart home integration and energy savings amid volatile energy costs. Commercial offerings target hotels, waterparks, and municipalities. Post-2021 IPO (spun from private equity owner CCMP Capital), Hayward has invested heavily in R&D (3-4% of sales), supply chain resilience, and digital platforms like the Hayward Pool Products app. With ~2,200 employees and manufacturing in North America, Europe, and Asia, it generates ~75% of revenue from the U.S., facing cyclical demand tied to housing, interest rates, and consumer discretionary spending.

(Ticker: OI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of October 10, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $10.86\n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.68 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $10.21 - $15.77\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 8.52\n- **Dividend Yield**: N/A (suspended)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nO-I Glass, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of glass containers, specializing in sustainable packaging solutions for the food and beverage industries. Headquartered in Perrysburg, Ohio, the company operates 73 manufacturing plants across 19 countries, serving markets in Europe, North America, South America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. O-I produces approximately 49 billion glass bottles and jars annually, primarily for beer (its largest segment), wine, spirits, non-alcoholic beverages, food jars, and pharmaceuticals. With a focus on circular economy principles, O-I emphasizes recycled content (up to 75% in some products) and lightweighting to reduce material use and emissions. The company generated $7.4 billion in trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue as of Q2 2024, with Europe contributing ~45% and North America ~30%.

Fundamentals show resilience (Europe growth offsets U.S. weakness), but near-term headwinds cap momentum. Trading at 6.5x EV/EBITDA (vs. peers 7-8x) suggests value, with 20-30% upside on cost savings realization.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $14.50 (30% upside from $10.86). Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($1.1B implied) + DCF (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth), targeting strong growth portfolios via sustainability tailwinds and beer premiumization. Moderate risk: Cyclical sector but low leverage. Hold for Q3 earnings (Oct 31, 2024).",

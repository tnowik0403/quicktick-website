(ALTO) is a leading U.S. producer of renewable fuels and specialty ingredients, operating 5 ethanol plants with ~350 million gallons annual capacity across California, Idaho, and Minnesota. The company generates revenue through three segments: Fuels (75-80% of sales), producing ethanol, high-quality alcohol, and distillers grains for animal feed; Food & Ingredients (15-20%), supplying specialty starches, proteins, and extracts for food, beverages, and industrial uses; and Essential Ingredients (5-10%), manufacturing bottled alcohol, hand sanitizer gels, and disinfectants. Formerly Pacific Ethanol, ALTO rebranded in 2021 to reflect diversification beyond fuels. Headquartered in Sacramento, CA, it emphasizes sustainability via renewable energy production amid rising demand for low-carbon fuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ALTO serves fuel blenders, food processors, and consumer product makers, navigating volatile commodity prices (corn/ethanol) while pursuing carbon capture and premium product expansion. With ~450 employees, it focuses on operational efficiency and strategic divestitures to streamline for growth in high-margin specialties.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released – Revenue $417.9 million (down 17% YoY), net loss $20.5 million or ($0.28)/share (vs. $3.8M profit prior year), Adjusted EBITDA -$4.2M.

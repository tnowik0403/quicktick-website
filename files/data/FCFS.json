(FCFS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $107.49 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.92 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $91.66 - $119.75  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFirstCash Holdings, Inc. (FCFS) is a leading operator of pawn stores and retail services in North America and Latin America, providing short-term collateralized loans, retail sales of merchandise, and complementary financial services. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the company operates approximately 2,900 pawn locations across 30 U.S. states, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, and Puerto Rico as of Q2 2024. Its core business revolves around pawn lending—advancing cash against pledged valuables like jewelry and electronics—followed by retail sales of forfeited or purchased goods. FCFS generates revenue from loan fees (high-margin), merchandise sales, and ancillary services like check cashing and buy-sell transactions.\n\nThe company has evolved from its roots as a U.S.-focused payday lender (pre-2016 divestitures) into a pawn-dominant model, emphasizing organic store growth and tuck-in acquisitions. In Latin America, which accounts for ~45% of stores and growing revenue contribution, FCFS benefits from underserved markets with high gold scrap demand and economic volatility driving pawn usage. U.S. operations (~55% of stores) focus on retail-heavy formats in Sunbelt states. With a debt-free balance sheet post-recapitalization and $200M+ in annual free cash flow, FCFS prioritizes share repurchases (1.2M shares retired in Q2 2024) and dividends (yield ~1.2%). Total Q2 2024 revenue hit $839.8M (+22% YoY), driven by 15% same-store growth and 7% store expansion (Word count: 248).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 1, 2024):** Revenue $839.8M (+22% YoY); net income $62.7M (+29% YoY); EPS $1.37 (+30% YoY); pawn loan balances +24% to $475M; same-store revenue +15% (company 10-K/Q filings via SEC EDGAR).\n- **Store Openings:** Added 46 net new stores in Q2 2024 (15 U.S., 31 LatAm); total footprint now ~2,900 (earnings call transcript, Seeking Alpha).\n- **Share Repurchases:** $100M+ authorized; repurchased 1.2M shares in Q2 at avg $100/share (earnings release).\n- **Gold Price Surge:** Benefited from record gold prices (~$2,600/oz in Sep 2024), boosting scrap purchasing and retail margins (mentioned in Sep 2024 investor update).\n- **Q3 2024 Guidance (Aug 1):** Revenue expected $860-890M; store growth +6-8% for FY2024 (earnings call).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Organic Expansion:** Target 6-8% annual store growth, prioritizing LatAm (15-20% CAGR) via low-capex greenfields (~$200K/store).\n- **Acquisitions:** Tuck-in buys of small pawn chains; $50M+ deployed in 2024 (e.g., 20-store deal in Colombia, Jun 2024).\n- **Retail Optimization:** Shift to higher-margin retail (50%+ of revenue); digital inventory tools for e-commerce testing.\n- **Capital Allocation:** 50% FCF to buybacks, 30% dividends, 20% growth capex (CFO comments, Q2 call).\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Category | Description | Revenue Contribution (Q2 2024) |\n|----------|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| Pawn Loans | Collateralized cash advances (avg 30-90 days, 100-240% APR equiv.) | ~35% |\n| Retail Sales | Jewelry, electronics, tools (forfeited/bought goods) | ~50% |\n| Buy-Sell | Direct purchases/resales | ~10% |\n| Other (Check Cashing) | Fee-based financial services | ~5% |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **LatAm Credit Cards:** Piloting unsecured consumer credit in Mexico (launch Q4 2024, 50 stores; earnings call).\n- **E-Commerce Platform:** Expanded online retail sales +25% YoY; full rollout across 500 U.S. stores by YE2024.\n- **AI Inventory Management:** Deployed in 40% of stores for pricing optimization (Q2 update).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **U.S. Pawn Market (~$5B loans):** ~12-15% share (largest operator; estimates from IBISWorld 2024 report, company filings).\n- **Mexico Pawn (~$3B):** ~25% share (dominant via 1,100+ stores).\n- **Forecast:** +1-2% annual U.S. gain via consolidation; LatAm +3-5% via expansion.

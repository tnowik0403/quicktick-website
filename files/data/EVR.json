(NYSE: EVR) is a premier global independent investment banking boutique founded in 1995, specializing in sophisticated advisory services rather than underwriting or lending, which distinguishes it from bulge-bracket banks. Headquartered in New York with 28 offices worldwide (including London, Hong Kong, and São Paulo), Evercore advises on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strategic advisory, restructurings and recapitalizations, capital advisory (including equity and debt placements), and private funds group services. It serves blue-chip clients across industries like technology, healthcare, consumer, energy, and financial institutions, emphasizing high-value, complex transactions. Evercore's Institutional Equities division provides sales, trading, and research, while its Private Capital Advisory (PCA) unit focuses on private equity fundraising and secondaries. In 2023, it ranked #10 in global M&A advisory by deal value (Refinitiv data). The firm employs ~2,100 people, with a partnership culture led by co-CEOs John Weinberg and Roger Altman. Revenue is fee-driven, cyclical with deal flow, but resilient due to its elite advisory focus. Recent strength stems from mega-deals and market recovery post-2022 slowdown.

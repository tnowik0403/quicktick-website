Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nWith $6 trillion in estimated private equity dry powder and investments in play, Evercore could see a surge in medium-term revenue growth amid a sponsor-driven M&A supercycle.\n\nIn 2026, M&A is expected to accelerate, with bold, strategic mergers and acquisitions driving fewer but larger deals. 2026 appears set up for clients to focus on fewer, bigger M&A deals.\n\nThis momentum in M&As is reinforced by regulatory shifts under the Trump administration, as the regulators move to relax \"well-managed\" requirements and streamline approval processes, creating a more favorable environment for consolidation.\n\n**Headwinds:**\nHeightened uncertainty could cause both the IPO window and M&A deal flow to dry up, significantly hurting investment banking pure plays like Evercore.\n\nNon-comp expenses rise due to targeted investments, while comp leverage remains gradual amid intense talent competition and regulatory focus on Big Tech.\n\n## 9.

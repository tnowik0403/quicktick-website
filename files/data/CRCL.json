Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Arc Blockchain - Major 2026 Launch:**\nCircle is introducing Arc, a new open Layer-1 blockchain designed from the ground up to serve the next era of stablecoin-native applications. Built by Circle to stand alone as its own independent ecosystem, Arc introduces a new kind of blockchain architecture — one that's optimized for stablecoin finance from line one: USDC as native gas: Low, predictable, dollar-denominated fees — no volatile crypto required\n\nKey Arc Features:\n• Built-in FX engine: Institutional-grade RFQ system for price discovery and 24/7 PvP onchain settlement\n• Instant finality: Deterministic sub-second settlement finality powered by Malachite, a highly performant consensus engine\n• Opt-in privacy: Selectively shielded balances and transactions so users and enterprises can stay compliant with their own obligations\n\n**Timeline**: Arc remains in a public testnet phase, meaning it is available for testing and development but not yet processing real financial transactions. The mainnet is planned for launch in 2026, with a beta release expected before full public availability\n\n**Circle xReserve**: Circle xReserve, a new interoperability infrastructure that enables blockchain teams to deploy USDC-backed stablecoins that are fully interoperable with USDC\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nStablecoins are moving off the speculative fringe and into the regulated core of global dollar flows. This shift sets the stage for Circle's push to the public markets and for how investors will judge its ability to convert regulatory tailwinds into real transaction volume.\n\n**Key Strategic Pillars:**\n• **Regulatory Compliance First**: By prioritizing stability, compliance, and developer-friendly infrastructure over the more speculative DeFi hype, Circle has carved out a reputation as the stablecoin for serious finance. Still, it faces a paradox: in the short term, this discipline has meant slower growth and market share loss to Tether in unregulated venues. The bet is that in the long run, liquidity will follow legitimacy\n\n• **Global Market Expansion**: Circle says that 70% of USDC usage is now coming from beyond U.S. borders. From my perspective, USDC still needs to expand its footprint internationally, and that means lining up foreign partners.\n\n• **Infrastructure Platform Development**: This diversification mimics what Amazon Web Services did for cloud computing. As USDC adoption grows, so too will the demand for Circle's API-based monetization services—transforming the company from a yield-based business into a platform-based fintech infrastructure giant.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Arc Testnet Participants (100+ Major Institutions):**\nOver 100 firms, including BlackRock, Visa, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Amazon Web Services, and Mastercard, have participated in its testnet phase programme.\n\n**Financial Institutions:**\n• Traditional finance heavyweights like State Street, Deutsche Bank, Invesco, and Société Générale\n• Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and First Abu Dhabi Bank\n• HSBC, one of the world's largest global banks\n\n**Technology & Payments:**\n• global tech providers like AWS and Mastercard\n• infrastructure players such as AWS, Mastercard and Cloudflare\n\n**Recent Partnership Highlights:**\n• Intuit, the global fintech behind TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, signed a multiyear partnership with Circle to leverage our stablecoin infrastructure across its entire platform.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent):**\n• **Total Revenue**: Circle reported total revenues and reserve income of $740 million, up 66% year over year.\n• **Net Income**: Net income rose to $214 million, or 64 cents per share, while total revenue and reserve income more than doubled to $740 million. Circle Internet Group reported net income of $214 million for Q3.\n• **USDC Circulation**: Total USDC in circulation grew to $73.7 billion by the end of the quarter, more than double the year-earlier figure.\n• **Adjusted EBITDA**: Adjusted EBITDA surged 78% year over year to $166 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 737 bps year over year to 57%.\n\n**Annual Performance:**\n• In 2024, Circle Internet Group's revenue was $1.68 billion, an increase of 15.57% compared to the previous year's $1.45 billion.\n• The company achieved net income of $156 million in 2024, down from $268 million in 2023.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Stablecoin Market Position:**\n• Circle's USDC market cap rose to $74 billion or a 25.5% share of the stablecoin market\n• Tether, meanwhile, has seen its dominance shrink, dropping from 67.5% at the start of the year to 60.4%\n• According to data compiled by Visa, USDC overtook Tether in stablecoin transaction volume in April 2024.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\n• Still, it lags behind market leader USDT, issued by Tether, which has a market cap of $183 billion.\n• With Tether and Circle controlling over 80% of global stablecoin value by market cap as of October 2025\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Tether (USDT):**\n• Tether's USDT (about $153 billion in circulation) remains the deepest liquidity pool, but its offshore base and limited reserve disclosure keep many corporates at arm's length. By contrast, Circle's USDC stablecoin is smaller today, yet offers daily attestations, G‑SIB custody, and a clear U.S. regulatory glide path that banks find compelling.\n\n**vs. PayPal USD:**\n• As of April 2025, PYUSD's total circulation was about $868 million, trailing far behind USDC and light-years behind Tether's ~$145 billion supply. Despite the PayPal brand's ubiquity, PYUSD has struggled to gain significant market traction\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n• Circle emphasized market-neutral positioning, regulatory/compliance posture, banking and reserve infrastructure, and network effects as durable competitive advantages.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Partnerships:**\n• **Visa**: Visa would allow US institutions to settle transactions using Circle Internet Group Inc.'s USDC token over the Solana blockchain. Visa is a design partner for Arc, a new Layer 1 blockchain developed by Circle (currently in public testnet). Arc's purpose-built design offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa's global commercial activity onchain. Visa also plans to utilize Arc for USDC settlement within its network and to operate a validator node once Arc goes live.\n\n• **Mastercard**: We expanded our existing partnership with Mastercard to enable both USDC and EURC settlement in the Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa region.\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\n• **Hashnote**: In January 2025, Circle acquired Hashnote, which operates a tokenized money market fund with $1.\n• **Interop (Pending)**: We also moved to strategically reinforce our infrastructure by entering into an agreement to acquire Interop. Expected to close in early 2026, the deal would bring Interop's talent and technology directly into Circle, accelerating key initiatives across Arc and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Regulatory Milestones:**\n• Circle points to 2025 as a turning point for policy. In the U.S., it highlights the GENIUS Act as a major step toward clear standards for fully reserved payment stablecoins.\n\n**Arc Public Testnet Launch (October 2025):**\n• Circle Internet Group, issuer of USDC stablecoin, has launched the public testnet for its new Arc blockchain network.\n\n**Banking License Progress:**\n• Separately, it says conditional approval tied to a proposed national trust structure would deepen its integration with the U.S. banking system, with the goal of adding another layer of comfort for institutions using USDC-linked rails.\n\n**Key Financial Results:**\n• Stock experienced significant volatility with CRCL shares rose to an all-time high of $298.99, an increase of 864.48% from its IPO price but has since corrected to current levels around $83.\n\n## 12.

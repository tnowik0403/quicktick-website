Core business segments include:\n\n- **Consumer Banking**: High-yield savings, money market accounts, IRAs, and certificates of deposit (CDs) sourced via online channels.\n- **Commercial Banking**: Leasing and finance solutions for equipment (e.g., autos, trucks, railcars), single-tenant real estate loans, multifamily real estate, and commercial real estate (CRE) loans.\n- **Small Business Administration (SBA) Lending**: SBA 7(a) and 504 loans.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $3.8 billion, with deposits at $2.9 billion (up 11% YoY) and loans at $3.2 billion. The bank differentiates through tech-driven operations, serving retail savers seeking competitive APYs (up to 5.00% on savings as of Oct 2024) and commercial clients needing specialized financing. INBK has navigated banking sector volatility post-2023 SVB crisis by prioritizing deposit growth (core deposits now 85% of funding) and risk management, reducing CRE exposure. Leadership under CEO David Baker emphasizes organic growth, digital innovation, and niche lending expertise. Trading on Nasdaq since 2014, INBK appeals to investors seeking regional bank exposure with online efficiencies, though it remains small-cap with cyclical risks tied to interest rates and CRE markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 24, 2024)**: Net income $3.8 million ($0.43 diluted EPS); net interest income $28.4 million (down 4% QoQ due to rate compression); provision for credit losses $1.5 million.

Attractive valuation (0.9x TBV, 10x fwd EPS) amid deposit strength and rate cut tailwinds, but CRE/regulatory risks cap aggressive buy. Strong growth upside (20-30% potential return) for moderate risk via NIM recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $45.00 (25% upside). Based on 1.1x TBV ($12.50 BV Q2) + 50% premium for growth; DCF implies $42-48 assuming 8% ROE, 5% deposit CAGR (Piper Sandler model adj.). Hold current; add on dips below $34.",

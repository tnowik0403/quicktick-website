This win completes the transition of Molina's existing Medicare-Medicaid Dual Eligible (MMP) members to integrated D-SNP products in all MMP states by January 1, 2026.

Growth Strategy\n\n**Revenue Growth Targets:**\nMolina Healthcare reiterated its commitment to its long-term growth targets, aiming for $46 billion in premium revenue by 2026 and at least $52 billion by 2027. Long-Term Revenue Targets: These wins move Molina closer to its 2026 premium revenue target of $46 billion and its 2027 low-end target of $52 billion.\n\n**Strategic Growth Pillars:**\n- We see multiple paths to achieve our target 13% to 15% revenue growth rate through 2026. We plan to maintain our balanced approach to growth, including market share gains, new state contracts, and M&A.\n- The company maintains a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities and remains opportunistic in deploying capital for accretive acquisitions.\n\n**Contract Wins and RFP Strategy:**\nApproximately $20 billion of current revenue will be up for state re-procurement over the 2024-2026 planning horizon; however, our proven track record of RFP success makes us confident in our ability to retain current revenue and pursue the majority of new state opportunities with a continued high win rate.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**State Medicaid Agencies:**\nThe company maintains critical partnerships with state Medicaid agencies across numerous states, with a significant presence in areas like California, Texas, Florida, and Michigan.\n\n**Geographic Footprint:**\nGeographic concentration is in large Medicaid states such as California, Texas, Ohio, Washington, and Florida; expansion aligns with state RFP cycles and duals synergies that enhance Molina Medicare Advantage and Medicaid cross‑market economics.\n\n**Key State Contracts:**\n- Our Texas Medicaid contracts represented approximately $3,587 million, or 14%, of consolidated Medicaid premium\n- Our Washington Medicaid contract represented approximately $3,952 million, or 15%\n\n**Provider Partnerships:**\nThe partnership with McLaren Physician Partners (MPP) is a significant, localized strategic alliance. In July 2025, Molina expanded its existing MPP relationship to include Medicaid for all regions. The contract amendment with Molina was effective June 1, 2025.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**2024 Financial Results:**\nIn 2024, Molina Healthcare's revenue was $39.16 billion, an increase of 18.67% compared to the previous year's $33.00 billion. Earnings were $1.18 billion, an increase of 8.07%.\n\n**Medical Care Ratios:**\nFor Q3 2025, the consolidated MCR was 92.6%, which is up from 89.2% in Q3 2024, showing the pressure points.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nThe updated guidance is driven by higher medical cost trend in all segments and, disproportionately, by the unprecedented medical cost trend in Marketplace, which is expected to continue through the end of the year. The higher medical cost trend is partially offset by operating leverage, a lower effective favorable tax rate, and the benefit of share repurchases completed in the third quarter of 2025.\n\n**Balance Sheet Strength:**\nThe company has maintained a robust capital foundation, with a debt-to-capital ratio of about 43%. Additionally, Molina has successfully reduced its debt level by approximately $200 million, further strengthening its financial position.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Headwinds:**\n- Molina Healthcare recently faced heightened scrutiny after elevated medical costs and revised 2025 profit guidance, especially in its Medicare and Marketplace segments, contributed to a sharp earnings disappointment and subsequent legal investigations into potential disclosure issues.\n- Unprecedented Medical Cost Trends: This was the most significant challenge discussed, impacting all segments. The persistence and magnitude of these increases in behavioral health, pharmacy, inpatient, and outpatient utilization are driving elevated MCRs.\n- ConnectiCare Integration: The acquisition of ConnectiCare is currently a drag on margins, with a projected timeline to reach target margins by 2027.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Looking ahead, regulatory dynamics could amplify Molina's advantages. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently proposed rate increases for 2026, potentially boosting Molina's Medicare segment.\n- Medicaid Rate Environment: Molina anticipates full-year 2025 Medicaid rates to be slightly higher than previously expected, as states incorporate recent cost trends through on- and off-cycle rate updates.\n- MOH's focus on Medicaid and Medicare Advantage offers a stable earnings base, while its broader commitment to enterprise efficiency is keeping margins resilient. Molina has halted unprofitable ventures and doubled down on its core managed-care operations – reinforcing that executives are prioritizing sustainable profitability.\n\n## 9.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Market leadership in Medicaid managed care\n- Strong revenue growth trajectory with clear targets through 2027\n- Disciplined cost management approach despite industry headwinds\n- Strategic positioning in growing dual-eligible markets\n- Endorsement from renowned investor Michael Burry as potential takeover target\n- Embedded earnings growth providing visibility into future performance\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- Elevated medical cost trends across all segments\n- Regulatory and policy uncertainties affecting government-sponsored programs\n- Integration challenges from recent acquisitions\n- Margin pressures in Marketplace segment\n- Dependence on government contracts and reimbursement rates\n\n**Growth Potential:**\nAccording to consensus estimates, earnings per share are expected to grow to $30.73 per share in 2029, indicating an annual growth rate of nearly 20%.\n\nDespite steady revenue growth and disciplined cost management, the company is currently trading at an attractive price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 0.22x.\n\n**Michael Burry's Valuation Perspective:**\nBurry concluded that MOH stock could possibly land below $100 due to federal budget concerns and \"would be a generational buy at that price.\"\n\nBurry said the company is positioned to remain profitable in Medicaid next year even as peers face losses, writing that Molina is \"looking to make money (albeit less money) in Medicaid in 2026 while most of its competition loses money.\" He believes Molina is \"best-positioned to emerge stronger as the cycle turns.\"\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 7.3/10**\n\n**Rationale:** Molina Healthcare presents a compelling investment opportunity despite near-term headwinds. The company's dominant position in Medicaid managed care, clear growth strategy targeting $52 billion in revenue by 2027, and potential for margin recovery in 2026 support a bullish outlook. Michael Burry's endorsement and takeover speculation add additional upside potential. However, current margin pressures, regulatory uncertainties, and elevated medical costs prevent a higher rating.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $240-260**\n\nBased on the company's embedded earnings potential of $8.65 per share, revenue growth trajectory, and peer valuations in the managed care sector, along with the potential for margin recovery in 2026 and strong positioning for the next rate cycle, a fair value range of $240-260 represents reasonable upside from current levels while accounting for execution risks and market dynamics.",

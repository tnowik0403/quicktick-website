(MOH) is a managed healthcare organization primarily serving government-sponsored programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, and Marketplace exchanges. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Long Beach, California, the company operates health plans in 19 states, focusing on low-income and underserved populations. Its business is divided into four segments: Medicaid (85%+ of revenue), Medicare (~10%), Marketplace (~5%), and Other (including military health services). Molina emphasizes high-quality, cost-effective care through a capitated model, where it receives fixed payments per member per month (PMPM) from governments and manages utilization via provider networks, care coordination, and data analytics.\n\nWith ~5.5 million members as of Q2 2024, Molina differentiates via its \"whole-person\" approach, integrating behavioral health, social determinants of care, and pharmacy benefits management. The company has grown rapidly through organic membership gains and strategic market entries, capitalizing on Medicaid redeterminations post-pandemic (which stabilized in 2024) and Medicare Advantage expansions. Revenue is driven by stable government reimbursements, though margins face pressure from medical loss ratios (MLR) averaging 89-90%. Molina's tech-forward platform (e.g., MolinaONE) enables predictive analytics for risk adjustment and utilization management. In a $1.2 trillion U.S. managed care market, Molina holds a niche as a Medicaid pure-play leader, with strong local market penetration but exposure to regulatory volatility.

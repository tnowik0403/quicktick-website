(PHIN), spun off from BorgWarner Inc. on April 1, 2024, is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of integrated propulsion technologies, primarily for internal combustion engines (ICE). The company operates through two main segments: the Fuel Systems Group (FSG), which provides high- and low-pressure fuel injection systems, pumps, modules, and engine components for gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuel engines; and the Filtration Solutions Group (FSG, formerly EFP), focused on aftermarket air, fuel, oil, and lube filtration products. Phinia serves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in light-duty passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles (trucks and buses), and off-highway/industrial applications, as well as the independent aftermarket. With ~10,500 employees across 45 manufacturing facilities in 12 countries, Phinia generated ~$3.3 billion in 2023 pro forma revenue, emphasizing premium aftermarket brands like WIX, Purolator, and Fram. Positioned as an \"ICE champion\" amid electrification trends, Phinia leverages its ~40% aftermarket revenue mix for recurring profitability, targeting stable demand in heavy-duty diesel sectors while navigating light vehicle headwinds.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 1, 2024, verified via Phinia IR and SEC 8-K)**: Revenue $796 million (+1.5% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $128 million (16.1% margin, +110 bps YoY); Net income $31 million (vs. $4 million loss YoY); Adjusted diluted EPS $1.24.

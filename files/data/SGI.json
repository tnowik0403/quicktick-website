Company Overview\n\nSomnigroup International Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, distributes, and retails bedding products in the United States and internationally. The company was formerly known as Tempur Sealy International, Inc. and changed its name to Somnigroup International Inc. in February 2025. Somnigroup International Inc. was founded in 1846 and is based in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nThe name Somnigroup is derived from the Latin somn meaning sleep, omni meaning all, and 'group' to represent our omnichannel strategy. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition of Mattress Firm, the Company generated approximately $8 billion in sales over the previous twelve months ending December 31, 2024, net of intercompany sales. This implies sales of approximately 85% in North America and 15% in International geographies, with approximately 65% of sales from direct-to-consumer channels and 35% from third-party retailers.\n\nThe company operates through a comprehensive portfolio of premium sleep brands and retail channels, positioning itself as the world's largest bedding company by scale and market capitalization.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\n**Stock Price & Performance:**\n- Current price: $93.88 USD\n- Market capitalization: $19.88 billion\n- 52-week performance: 55.40% increase over the last year\n- 52-week range: $53.10 - $95.36\n- Dividend yield: 0.63% (quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share)\n\n**Financial Metrics:**\n- 2024 revenue: $4.93 billion (up 0.11% YoY)\n- 2024 earnings: $384.30 million (up 4.40%)\n- EPS (TTM): $1.58\n- Employee count: approximately 20,000\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company provides mattresses, foundations and adjustable foundations, and adjustable bases, as well as other products comprising pillows and other accessories under the Tempur-Pedic, Sealy, Stearns & Foster, and Sleep's brands.\n\n**Brand Portfolio:**\n- **Tempur-Pedic**: Premium memory foam mattresses with proprietary TEMPUR material\n- **Sealy**: Traditional and hybrid mattresses including Posturepedic line\n- **Stearns & Foster**: Luxury mattress segment\n- **Sleepy's**: Value-oriented brand offerings\n\n**Retail Operations:**\nThe company also operates a portfolio of retail brands, including Mattress Firm, Dreams, Tempur-Pedic retail stores, SOVA, and Sleep Outfitters\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI-Powered Sleep Technology:**\nSince 2019, Fullpower's Sleeptracker-AI (\"Sleeptracker\") technology has powered the TEMPUR-Ergo® Smart Base collection for over 250 million nights of sleep. As part of the expanded partnership, Tempur Sealy, a wholly-owned business of Somnigroup, is making a $25 million equity investment in Fullpower to acquire an approximate 15.6% ownership stake. In addition, Tempur Sealy and Fullpower have signed a multi-year extension through 2036 of Tempur Sealy's exclusive rights to embed Sleeptracker technology in its products.\n\n**Product Line Expansions:**\nMattress Firm has entered into supply arrangements with Purple Innovation, Inc. (\"Purple\") and Leggett & Platt, Inc. (\"Leggett & Platt\"). These arrangements are for distribution and development of mattresses, foundations and other bedding related products across a range of price points that are consistent with Mattress Firm's customer focused merchandising plan. The expanded assortment of products is expected to be available at Mattress Firm starting in late 2025 and 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Vertical Integration through Mattress Firm:**\nThe Mattress Firm acquisition transforms Somnigroup from a cyclical manufacturer into an integrated sleep ecosystem with direct consumer relationships, creating a dominant U.S. retail footprint that captures mid-50% of its own sales and generates $60 million in EBITDA synergies in year one.\n\n**International Expansion:**\nInternational segment delivered 10.9% reported growth (7.2% constant currency) for nine consecutive quarters, powered by refreshed Tempur products and expanded distribution\n\n**Technology Investment:**\nThe August 2025 investment in Fullpower-AI represents more than a technology partnership; it secures exclusive rights to Sleeptracker-AI through 2036 and provides access to 250 million nights of anonymized sleep data. This matters because it transforms mattresses from passive products into active health monitoring devices, creating recurring engagement and potential subscription revenue streams.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Direct-to-Consumer Channels:**\nMattress Firm has over 2,000 locations in the United States\n- Tempur-Pedic retail stores\n- Dreams (international retail chain)\n- E-commerce platforms\n\n**Third-Party Retailers:**\n- Hospitality industry partnerships\n- Healthcare sector distribution\n- Various furniture and bedding retailers globally\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent):**\nSomnigroup International Inc (NYSE:SGI) delivered a record quarter across nearly all key operating metrics, with net sales up approximately 63% to $2.1 billion.\n\nNet sales rose to $2,122.6 million from $1,300.0 million, and net income increased to $177.4 million from $130.0 million. Diluted EPS was $0.83 versus $0.73 a year ago.\n\nMattress Firm contributed $1,070.8 million of revenue and $66.7 million of net income in the quarter, while Tempur Sealy North America and International delivered $736.1 million and $315.7 million, respectively.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nSomnigroup International expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.60 to $2.75 per share.\nThe company projects an adjusted EPS for 2025 between $2.60 and $2.75, with anticipated sales nearing $7.5 billion. The company plans to invest $700 million in advertising and expects an EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Q3 2025 gross margins in Tempur Sealy North America surged 1,800 basis points to 58.4%, driven by the elimination of intercompany sales and operational efficiencies\n- Strong synergy realization from Mattress Firm integration\n- The fact that Somnigroup can invest $700 million in advertising—more than double any competitor—creates a self-reinforcing cycle of brand awareness and retail traffic\n- Exclusive AI technology partnership through 2036\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Total debt, net, was $4,625.2 million at September 30, 2025\n- 2.21x debt-to-equity ratio remains a key risk to monitor\n- Flat U.S. bedding market conditions\n- Economic sensitivity affecting housing market and consumer spending\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**U.S. Market Position:**\nThe company commands a significant presence, particularly in North America, where it holds approximately 36.7% of the mattress market share.\n\nSealy tops the list with 15% market share. Both Sealy and #2 Serta have seen their market share stabilize somewhat in the past year, after having lost share in previous years.\n\n**Combined Market Presence:**\nPost-deal market share exceeds 32%, but divestitures and consent decrees cap potential dominance.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Sleep Number (SNBR):**\nSleep Number's 7% market share and high debt load make it vulnerable to further share loss, while its basic sleep tracking technology pales against Somnigroup's AI-powered platform.\nTempur Sealy is followed by Sleep Number ($1.73 billion). Sleep Number tops the chart as runner-up at $0.45 billion.\n\n**Purple Innovation (PRPL):**\nPurple Innovation's struggles are even more stark. At roughly $470 million in revenue and negative 12.4% margins, Purple operates at one-tenth Somnigroup's scale with no clear path to profitability. Its reliance on wholesale partners, including Mattress Firm, places it at Somnigroup's mercy.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nThe company's scale—nearly $5 billion in trailing revenue, 10x Purple's size—creates procurement advantages and manufacturing efficiencies that widen the competitive moat during industry downturns.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Mattress Firm Acquisition (Completed February 2025):**\nTempur Sealy offered $4 billion to acquire Mattress Firm. It funded the deal with about $2.7 billion plus proceeds from existing borrowings and 34.2 million shares of common stock.\n\n**Fullpower-AI Partnership:**\nAs part of the expanded partnership, Tempur Sealy, a wholly-owned business of Somnigroup, is making a $25 million equity investment in Fullpower to acquire an approximate 15.6% ownership stake. In addition, Tempur Sealy and Fullpower have signed a multi-year extension through 2036\n\n**Proposed Leggett & Platt Acquisition:**\nSomnigroup International Inc. (NYSE: SGI, \"Company\" or \"Somnigroup\") today announced that it submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of Leggett & Platt Inc. (NYSE: LEG) to acquire all outstanding common shares of Leggett & Platt in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the Proposal, Leggett & Platt shareholders would receive shares of Somnigroup common stock with a market value of $12.00 for every one share of Leggett & Platt common stock\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q3 2025 Earnings Beat (November 6, 2025):**\nSomnigroup's Q3 2025 earnings exceeded expectations, with a reported EPS of $0.95 compared to the forecasted $0.85. This 11.76% surprise reflects the company's robust performance amid a flat U.S. bedding market. Revenue also surpassed forecasts by 3.41%, reaching $2.12 billion.\n\n**Board Appointments (2025):**\nSomnigroup International (NYSE: SGI) has appointed Christopher Cook as an independent director to its Board of Directors, effective September 30, 2025. This appointment expands the board from seven to eight members. Cook brings over 20 years of executive leadership experience in the retail sector.\n\n**Corporate Name Change:**\nThe company was formerly known as Tempur Sealy International, Inc. and changed its name to Somnigroup International Inc. in February 2025.\n\n## 13.

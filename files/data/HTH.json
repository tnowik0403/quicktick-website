(NYSE: HTH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of November 1, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $31.42\n- Market Capitalization: $2.75 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $25.45 - $34.79\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 17.2\n- Dividend Yield: 1.78% ($0.56 annual)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nHilltop Holdings Inc. (HTH) is a Dallas, Texas-based diversified financial services holding company founded in 2007. It operates through three primary segments: Banking (via PlainsCapital Bank, a Texas-focused commercial bank with ~$29 billion in assets), Mortgage Origination (through PrimeLending, a non-bank residential mortgage lender), Investment Banking & Brokerage (HilltopSecurities, providing public finance, equity research, and trading services), and Insurance (National Insurance Company and American Modern Insurance Group, specializing in property & casualty coverage for manufactured housing, renters, and niche markets). \n\nHTH emphasizes regional dominance in Texas banking and lending, with PlainsCapital serving middle-market businesses, real estate, and high-net-worth individuals. PrimeLending originates ~$10-12B in mortgages annually, focusing on purchase loans amid a refi slowdown. HilltopSecurities ranks among top municipal bond underwriters (top 10 nationally). Insurance provides specialty P&C lines, leveraging American Modern's acquisition in 2023 for scale. With ~3,500 employees, HTH targets resilient revenue streams across cycles: net interest income from banking (45-50% of revenue), fees from lending/brokerage (30-35%), and insurance premiums/underwriting (15-20%). Recent focus on deposit growth, cost discipline, and insurance expansion positions it for mid-single-digit revenue growth in a high-rate environment.

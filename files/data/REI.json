(NASDAQ: REI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- **Closing Price**: $1.82\n- **Market Capitalization**: $370.4 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $1.19 - $2.24\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.68 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 7.48\n- **EV/EBITDA**: 2.42\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRing Energy, Inc. (REI) is a Houston-based independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused on acquiring, exploring, developing, and producing oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. The company operates across key plays including the Northwest Shelf, Central Basin Platform (CBP), and Delaware Basin, emphasizing low-risk, oil-weighted assets with multi-zone development potential. REI's strategy centers on capital-efficient drilling using horizontal wells, enhanced by its ~1,300-mile owned midstream pipeline network and water infrastructure, which reduces transportation costs and supports scalability.\n\nFounded in 2004, REI has grown through accretive acquisitions and organic development, holding ~48,000 net acres (primarily in Andrews, Gaines, and Lea Counties). Production as of Q2 2024 averaged 12,465 Boe/d (81% oil), with proved reserves of 142.7 MMBoe (71% oil). The company targets 5-10% annual production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet (debt ~$190M, liquidity ~$60M post-Q2). Recent focus on the San Andres formation (CBP/Northwest Shelf) leverages existing infrastructure for high returns (e.g., 3-4x multiple on capital). REI differentiates via low breakeven costs (~$40-45/WTI) and hedge coverage (50-60% of 2025 production). Amid volatile energy markets, REI positions as a Permian \"tuck-in\" play for larger operators seeking bolt-on opportunities.

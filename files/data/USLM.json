Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 14, 2024, close - verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Price**: $392.84\n- **Market Cap**: $2.57B\n- **52-Week Range**: $183.51 - $449.93\n- **P/E (TTM)**: 25.2\n- **Forward P/E**: 22.8\n- **Dividend Yield**: 0.32% ($0.50 quarterly, last ex-date Sep 20, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview\nUnited States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (USLM) is a leading U.S. producer of high-quality lime and limestone products, primarily serving industrial, construction, and environmental markets. Headquartered in Frederick, Oklahoma, the company operates five lime and limestone plants in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, with quarries providing essential raw materials. USLM manufactures quicklime, hydrated lime, and pulverized limestone, which are critical inputs for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) in power plants, water and wastewater treatment, steel production, construction (soil stabilization and asphalt), paper manufacturing, and agriculture. \n\nThe company's competitive edge stems from its vertically integrated operations, proximity to major customers (reducing logistics costs), and access to high-calcium limestone reserves with over 100 years of supply. In 2023, USLM produced approximately 1.2 million tons of lime equivalents, focusing on high-margin hydrated lime (key for environmental applications). Demand is driven by U.S. infrastructure spending (e.g., IIJA), stringent EPA regulations on emissions, and industrial recovery. USLM has delivered consistent growth, with revenue compounding at ~15% CAGR over five years, bolstered by plant expansions and pricing power in a consolidated market. Recent quarters highlight record profitability amid supply constraints for peers.

(SMCI), founded in 1993 and headquartered in San Jose, California, is a leading provider of high-performance server and storage solutions optimized for data centers, cloud computing, AI, 5G/telecom, edge computing, and enterprise IT. The company designs energy-efficient systems using modular building blocks, enabling rapid customization with the latest processors from Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and others. SMCI's product portfolio spans rackmount servers, blade servers, GPU-accelerated systems for AI/ML training/inference, storage arrays, and networking gear. It operates a \"short lead time\" model with manufacturing in the US, Taiwan, and Netherlands, emphasizing sustainability (e.g., liquid-cooled systems reducing power by up to 40%).\n\nSMCI has ridden the AI boom, with revenue surging from $7.1B in FY2023 to $14.94B in FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), driven by Nvidia Blackwell GPU demand. However, recent challenges include gross margin compression to 14.3% in Q1 FY2025 (ended Sep 30, 2024) and a delayed 10-K filing due to internal controls review, announced Oct 28, 2024, causing a ~30% stock drop. Despite volatility, SMCI holds ~10% US server market share and is a top-3 AI server vendor globally.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Earnings Highlights** (Q1 FY2025, ended Sep 30, 2024; reported Oct 29, 2024; sourced from SMCI IR and Seeking Alpha transcripts):\n  | Metric             | Q1 FY2025 | YoY Change | Notes |\n  |--------------------|-----------|------------|-------|\n  | Revenue            | $5.663B  | +147%     | Beat est. $5.575B; AI systems 70% of mix |\n  | GAAP Gross Margin  | 10.9%    | -         | Compressed by inventory reserves |\n  | Non-GAAP Gross Margin | 14.3% | -         | Nvidia DLC ramp-up |\n  | Adj.

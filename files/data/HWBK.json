(HWBK) is a bank holding company headquartered in Jefferson City, Missouri, primarily operating through its subsidiary Hawthorn Bank. Founded in 1932, the company provides a full suite of community banking services across 23 full-service banking offices in Missouri, with a focus on the Jefferson City, Columbia, and Lee's Summit metropolitan areas, as well as rural communities.

With total assets of approximately $3.7 billion (Q2 2024), HWBK targets small-to-medium businesses, agribusiness, healthcare, and real estate sectors in its Missouri footprint.

Seeking Alpha articles (Aug 2024) note undervaluation vs. peers.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Organic Focus**: Emphasize core deposit growth (target 5-7% annual via relationship pricing, per Q2 call) and C&I/ag lending expansion in Missouri manufacturing/ag sectors.\n- **Digital Enhancement**: Launched upgraded mobile app (Q3 2024 rollout) for better customer acquisition.\n- **Fee Income Diversification**: Grow trust assets ($1.2B AUM, +3% YoY) and treasury services; target non-interest income to 20% of revenue (from 14%).\n- **Capital Management**: CET1 ratio 10.2% (Q2); $0.17 quarterly dividend maintained; open to opportunistic M&A if accretive.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Elevated CRE concentrations (32% of assets); higher provisions from office segment (~5% criticized loans, Q2 call). Deposit competition in high-rate environment. | Strong deposit franchise (80% core, low beta 35%); local market loyalty; conservative underwriting (NPA 0.45%). |\n| **Sector (Regional Banks)** | Fed rates (5.25-5.50% as of Oct 2024) pressure NIM; regulatory scrutiny on CRE (FDIC guidelines July 2024); recession fears impacting loans. | Rate cut expectations (Fed Sep 18, 2024 cut 50bps); deposit inflows from SVB fallout; Missouri economy resilient (unemployment 3.3%, Aug 2024 BLS). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Deposits**: Non-interest bearing (25%), interest checking/savings/MMDA (40%), CDs/time (35%).\n- **Loans**: CRE (60%), C&I (20%), 1-4 family residential (10%), ag/consumer (10%).\n- **Fee-Based**: Trust/estate ($25M revenue Q2), debit cards ($4M), mortgage origination.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Digital Banking Upgrade**: Full rollout Q4 2024, including Zelle integration and enhanced fraud tools (announced Q2 call).\n- **Ag Lending Expansion**: New specialized team for rural Missouri (launched June 2024).\n- **No major capex announced**; focus on organic tech upgrades vs. new branches.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- Missouri community banking: ~1.5% statewide deposits (per FDIC Q2 2024 Call Report data; $3.1B deposits vs. $210B state total).\n- Jefferson City MSA: 25-30% deposit share (local leader, per S&P Global Market Intelligence).\n- Columbia MSA: 10-12% loan share.\n\n**Forecast**: Stable to +1-2% annual growth through 2025 via deposit gains; potential decline in CRE share if sector contracts (analyst consensus: 3% revenue CAGR 2024-26, per Yahoo Finance).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q2 2024) | HWBK | UMBF (UMB Financial, peer) | BHLB (Bank of Hawaii) | Sector Avg (SNL Frands) |\n|------------------|------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Assets ($B)** | 3.7 | 45.0 | 25.0 | - |\n| **NIM (%)** | 3.58 | 2.95 | 3.10 | 3.40 |\n| **ROA (%)** | 0.43 | 1.05 | 0.95 | 0.90 |\n| **CET1 (%)** | 10.2 | 11.5 | 12.1 | 11.0 |\n| **P/TB Ratio** | 0.75 | 1.45 | 1.20 | 1.10 |\n- **Edge**: HWBK trades at discount (0.75x TB vs. peers 1.2x) due to CRE risk; stronger NIM from deposit mix.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Investment services via LPL Financial (third-party); correspondent banking with larger regionals.\n- **M&A**: No recent; past acquisition of Darby Bank branches (2011). CEO open to \"tuck-in\" deals (Q2 call, May 2024).\n- **Major Clients**: State of Missouri agencies (government deposits ~15%); local healthcare (e.g., Capital Region Medical Center); agribusiness (e.g., MFA Oil); CRE developers in Jefferson City.\n- **Potential**: Expanding with Jefferson City growth (state govt hub); eyeing Kansas City metro inflows.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community involvement (e.g., $500K donations 2023); low carbon footprint as regional bank.\n- **Management**: CEO Frank Kent (since 2004) tenure praised for navigation of 2008 crisis; aligned incentives (insiders own 15%).\n- **Risks**: CRE stress tests passed (internal, Q2); litigation none material.\n- **Sentiment**: Neutral-positive; Zacks Rank #3 (Hold, Oct 2024); short interest 0.5%.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **6/10 (Hold)** – Attractive valuation (52% discount to TB peers) and deposit strength offer upside, but CRE headwinds and slow growth cap potential amid macro uncertainty. Suitable for moderate risk, but lacks strong growth catalysts vs. larger regionals.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $28.00 (25% upside from $22.28). Based on 10x 2025E EPS $2.60 (consensus), 0.95x TB (adjusted for CRE), DCF implying 8% IRR. Strong growth portfolio would target 20-30% upside here, but monitor Q3 earnings (Oct 28, 2024 est.) for CRE provisions.\n\n*Sources: Company 10-Q (Aug 2024), earnings transcripts (Seeking Alpha), FDIC/S&P data, Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg real-time (Oct 11, 2024).

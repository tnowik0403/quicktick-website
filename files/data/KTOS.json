Company Overview\n\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:KTOS) develops and fields transformative, affordable technology, platforms and systems for United States National Security related customers, allies and commercial enterprises. The company operates in two segments, Kratos Government Solutions and Unmanned Systems. At Kratos, affordability is a technology, and we specialize in unmanned systems, satellite communications, cyber security/warfare, microwave electronics, missile defense, hypersonic systems, training, combat systems and next generation turbo jet and turbo fan engine development. The company primarily serves national security-related agencies, the U.S. Department of Defense, intelligence and classified agencies, international government agencies, and commercial customers.\n\nKratos operates in a \"Goldilocks\" zone. It is larger and more established than Silicon Valley startups like Anduril Industries, yet more nimble and cost-effective than the \"Big Five\" (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics).\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 12, 2026, the stock price is $117.86 with a market capitalization of $19.195 billion. The 52-week high is $119.63 and the 52-week low is $23.90. 2026 dawned with KTOS stock consistently rising, opening the year at roughly $76.55 before making a sharp climb to $111.25. Shares have jumped 293% over the past year, far outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index's 20% gain during the same period.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n• **Unmanned Systems**: The Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie is an experimental stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) designed and built by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for the United States Air Force's Low Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) program.\n\n• **Satellite Ground Systems**: Developing software-defined ground stations that can adapt to evolving mission requirements.\n\n• **Rocket and Propulsion Systems**: By vertically integrating solid rocket motor production, Kratos has insulated itself from the supply chain shortages that have plagued the missile industry.\n\n• **Microwave Electronics**: For missile, radar, missile defense, space, and satellite applications\n\n• **Command and Control Software**: Including the EPOCH system for satellite operations\n\n• **Hypersonic Systems**: Manufacturing and payload integration capabilities\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n• **Valkyrie Production Scaling**: Thanks to that foresight, Kratos now has 15 to 20 Valkyries ready for immediate delivery, positioning it well to respond swiftly to orders. DeMarco says 15-20 Valkyries could be completed and made ready for turnover to a customer in 2026.\n\n• **New Manufacturing Facilities**: \n  - Kratos Opens New 55,000-Square-Foot State-of-the-Art Hypersonic System Manufacturing and Payload Integration Facility in Princess Anne, Maryland\n  - Kratos opened a new 22,500-square-foot Propulsion Manufacturing Facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan on Nov 13, 2025 to support high-rate production of its Spartan turbojet engine family. Kratos says the site is designed to enable quantities of 50,000+ engines per year.\n\n• **German Valkyrie Variant**: In July 2025, Airbus announced a partnership with Kratos to develop an uncrewed collaborative combat aircraft (UCCA) based on the XQ-58A for the German Air Force. The UCCA will feature an Airbus-made mission system and is expected to be combat-ready by 2029.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nWe are increasing our full year 2026 organic revenue growth forecast up to 15 percent to 20 percent above our expected increased annual 2025 revenue. Additionally, we are providing a preliminary 2027 organic revenue growth target of 18 percent to 23 percent above this increased 2026 estimated revenue range.\n\nThe Kratos business model is unique for its \"Self-Funding\" R&D. While traditional primes wait for government funding to begin development, Kratos often uses its own capital to build prototypes. This allows them to retain Intellectual Property (IP) and move from concept to flight significantly faster than the industry average.\n\nFor Kratos, this aligns with a long-standing strategy of \"defense verticalization,\" where the company maintains control over its internal supply chain and production facilities to ensure rapid delivery of space systems.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Current Clients**:\n• U.S. Department of Defense\n• U.S. Marine Corps (Valkyrie program)\n• U.S. Air Force\n• U.S. Navy\n• Intelligence and classified agencies\n• International government agencies\n\n**Major Partnerships**:\n• This award combines Northrop Grumman's uncrewed capabilities and autonomous leadership with Kratos' Valkyrie uncrewed aerial system to work alongside crewed fighters to provide air dominance in high-threat environments.\n• I can now also officially say that Airbus has partnered with Kratos to develop a German variant of the Kratos Valkyrie CCA, and in the third quarter we just ended, we shipped the first two Valkyries to Airbus under this new contract.\n• The unveiling of Kratos' partnership with L3Harris, marks an era of increased hypersonic motor production.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**:\n• Third Quarter 2025 Revenues of $347.6 million increased $71.7 million, reflecting 23.7 percent organic growth from third quarter 2024 Revenues of $275.9 million.\n• Kratos reported in the third quarter 2025 GAAP Net Income of $8.7 million and GAAP Net Income per share of $0.05. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.14 for the third quarter of 2025.\n\n**2025 Full Year Guidance**:\n• Kratos raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $1.310-$1.330 billion, indicating 14-15% organic growth.\n• The company forecasts full-year revenue between $1.32 billion and $1.33 billion, along with adjusted EBITDA in the range of $114 million to $120 million.\n\n**Backlog**: The company enters 2026 with a record backlog of $1.48 billion, providing high visibility for the next 24 months.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe defense drone and autonomous systems market is highly fragmented. While Anduril has won key software-centric contracts, Kratos retains the advantage in industrialized manufacturing. The company's ability to mass-produce jet-powered airframes at scale is a barrier to entry for software-first firms.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the Valkyrie's transition to a programme of record is significant not only for Kratos but for the US military's evolving approach to unmanned systems: attritable drones that can be produced quickly, in numbers, and at a fraction of the cost of traditional combat aircraft.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Traditional Defense Primes**:\n• KTOS's 1.9% operating margin trails LHX's 11.1%, signaling high R&D/prototype investment and fixed-price contract cost pressures.\n• KTOS's 14.0% revenue growth outpaces primes like LMT but lags AVAV, highlighting its niche tech success amidst intense drone market competition.\n\n**vs. Drone Specialists**:\n• (AVAV) and Kratos have grown from small-cap to mid-cap status. Kratos has returned 175.9% year to date, while AeroVironment has returned 76.6%.\n• However, Kratos shows stronger momentum with earnings estimates implying year-over-year growth, strong financial position and better share price performance. Still, for investors looking at growth and momentum, Kratos currently appears more attractive.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Key Partnerships**:\n• **Northrop Grumman**: The contract for the MUX TACAIR CCA is an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with an initial value of $231.5 million.\n• **Airbus**: European variant development for German Air Force\n• **L3Harris**: Hypersonic motor production partnership\n\n**Recent Acquisition**:\n• Kratos announced the acquisition of Orbit, a leading provider of satellite-based communication systems, expected to be immediately accretive and enhance growth opportunities.\n\n## 11.

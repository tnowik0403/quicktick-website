LYB generated $3.8 billion in cash from operating activities during 2024.\n\nIn 2024, approximately $1.8 billion was reinvested in the business through capital expenditures while $1.9 billion was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe company maintains a robust investment-grade balance sheet with $8.0 billion of available liquidity, including $3.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, at year-end.\n\n**Dividend Performance:**\nIn 2024, LyondellBasell returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, marking 14 consecutive years of dividend growth.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\nThroughout 2024, petrochemical markets faced headwinds from soft global demand, rising raw material costs and economic uncertainty. Markets were broadly pressured by weak demand for durable goods, which impacted margins in the company's Olefins & Polyolefins and Intermediates & Derivatives segments. Margin recovery in the company's Advanced Polymer Solutions segment was limited by global declines in automotive production.\n\nTariff and trade uncertainties are potential headwinds.\n\nThe business is highly cyclical and heavily dependent on commodity prices, leaving it with minimal pricing power.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nEntering 2025, LYB remains watchful and prepared for macroeconomic catalysts that will drive restocking of supply chains, improve demand for durable goods and support economic recovery. North American domestic demand for polyolefins rebounded in 2024, after two years of declines. The company expects seasonal demand improvements to emerge across most product lines during the first quarter. Reductions in interest rates, moderation of inflation and pent-up demand should be supportive for increased consumption of durable goods.\n\nRegulatory pressure is accelerating the shift to a circular model, creating a multi-billion dollar opportunity in advanced recycling.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nLyondellBasell's scale supports its 7-9% global market share in key polymers.

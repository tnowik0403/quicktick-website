(NASDAQ: RIVN) is a U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer specializing in premium adventure-oriented trucks, SUVs, and commercial vans. Founded in 2009 by RJ Scaringe and headquartered in Irvine, California, with primary manufacturing in Normal, Illinois, Rivian went public in November 2021 via direct listing. The company designs, engineers, and assembles high-performance EVs emphasizing off-road capability, long range (up to 410 miles EPA for R1T), sustainability, and advanced software ecosystems like driver-assist (Driver+) and over-the-air updates. Its core consumer products are the R1T quad-motor pickup (starting ~$70k) and R1S three-row SUV (~$76k), launched in 2021-2022. Rivian also produces the Electric Delivery Van (EDV) exclusively for Amazon, with 100,000-unit commitment through 2030. Cumulative deliveries exceed 57,000 vehicles as of Q3 2024. Rivian controls its supply chain, including in-house battery packs (LFP and NMC cells via Samsung SDI/SK On) and a vertically integrated software stack. Expansion includes a Georgia plant (opening 2025 for R2) and adventure-focused accessories/ecosystem. Amid EV market challenges, Rivian achieved its first gross profit in Q4 2023, cut costs 25% YoY via workforce reductions (10% in 2024), and secured VW partnership for scaling. However, it burns ~$1B quarterly cash, with $7.2B liquidity as of Q2 2024. Rivian targets mass-market expansion with affordable R2/R3 models to capture EV truck/SUV growth, positioning as Tesla rival in adventure segment.

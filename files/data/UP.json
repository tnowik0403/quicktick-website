Reddit/StockTwits neutral-positive on restructuring.\n- **Risks**: Dilution risk (shares outstanding doubled post-bankruptcy), regulatory (FAA Part 135 renewals).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold)**: Moderate upside from restructuring momentum and travel rebound, but high execution risk, losses, and volatility temper enthusiasm. Suitable for speculative growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $3.50** (90% upside): Based on 1.0x 2025E sales ($1.4B, per management guide), 20% discount for risk; DCF implies $2.80-$4.20 (10% IRR, moderate growth assumptions).

Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Akamai operates one of the world's largest distributed edge platforms, with over 365,000 servers across 135 countries, handling trillions of daily interactions. The company delivers fast, secure digital experiences by accelerating content delivery via its Content Delivery Network (CDN), enabling edge computing for AI/ML workloads, and protecting against cyber threats like DDoS attacks and web application vulnerabilities.\n\nAkamai's business is divided into two main segments: Security Solutions (49% of Q2 2024 revenue) and Compute/Delivery (51%). Security offerings include DDoS mitigation, Web Application Firewall (WAF), bot management, and API security. Compute/Delivery encompasses CDN, media delivery, and emerging edge compute services powered by its Linode acquisition. In recent years, Akamai has pivoted from traditional CDN dominance—facing pricing pressure from hyperscalers like AWS CloudFront—to high-margin security (gross margins ~82% in Q2 2024) and edge computing growth. With 2023 revenue of $3.88 billion, Akamai serves enterprises in media, gaming, ecommerce, finance, and government, emphasizing zero-trust security and AI-driven edge processing. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, its platform processed 3.5 trillion requests daily in Q2 2024, positioning it as a resilient player in the $100B+ cloud security and CDN markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $995.1 million (+3% YoY), Security revenue $486.8 million (+13% YoY), Compute/Delivery $508.3 million (-2% YoY). GAAP EPS $1.01, non-GAAP EPS $1.64. Gross margin 80.5% overall (Security 82.1%). Q3 guidance: Revenue $980-1,000 million, non-GAAP EPS $1.55-1.65 (earnings transcript via Seeking Alpha).\n- **September 24, 2024**: Announced partnership expansion with NVIDIA to deliver AI inference at the edge using Akamai's compute platform, targeting low-latency generative AI apps (Akamai press release).\n- **October 8, 2024**: Launched \"Edge AI Campaign\" highlighting customer wins in AI workload acceleration; stock dipped 2% amid broader market selloff (Yahoo Finance news).\n- **Ongoing**: Q3 earnings call scheduled for October 30, 2024; analysts expect ~2% YoY revenue growth.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Security-First Pivot**: Targeting 15-20% annual security growth through upmarket expansion (e.g., K6R program converting SMBs to enterprises). FY2024 guidance: Security ~$2.0-2.1 billion.\n- **Edge Computing Expansion**: Integrating Linode (acquired Feb 2022 for $900M) for developer-friendly cloud; goal to reach $1B+ ARR by 2026 via AI/ML at edge.\n- **Platform Convergence**: Unified \"Akamai Connected Cloud\" – 50%+ customers multi-product by end-2024.\n- **M&A Focus**: Bolt-on deals for adjacencies; $1B+ cash for tuck-ins.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Strong security demand (13% Q2 growth); Linode synergies adding $200M+ ARR; AI edge tailwinds. | CDN pricing erosion (-2% Q2); SMB churn in K6R transition; high R&D spend (24% of rev). |\n| **Sector**  | Cyber threats surge (global DDoS attacks +20% YoY per Akamai SOTI report Q2 2024); edge AI boom ($50B TAM by 2028). | Hyperscaler free tiers commoditizing CDN; macro slowdown delaying IT budgets (Fortune 500 deals slip). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Security**: Kona Site Defender (WAF), Prolexic (DDoS), Bot Manager, Guardicore segmentation.\n- **Compute/Delivery**: Aqua CDN, Media Delivery, Ion Web Performance, Linode Cloud (Kubernetes, VPC).\n- **Other**: API Gateway, Client Reputation (zero-trust).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Edge AI Platform** (GA Sept 2024): NVIDIA-integrated for real-time AI inference; pilot with major telco.\n- **Connected Cloud Multi-Tenant** (beta Q3 2024): Unified security/compute for enterprises.\n- **Linode GPU Instances** (launched June 2024): H100 support for AI training at edge.\n\n## Market Share Approximations (2024 estimates from Synergy Research, Statista)\n- Global CDN: 19% (leader; ahead of Cloudflare 14%, AWS 12%).\n- DDoS Protection: 25% (top with Cloudflare at 20%).\n- WAF: 15% (behind Cloudflare 22%, F5 18%).\n- Edge Compute: <5% (nascent; growing from Linode base).\n\n## Market Share Forecast\n- CDN: Stable/decline to 17% by 2026 (hyperscaler pressure).\n- Security: Expand to 28% DDoS/WAF share via 15% CAGR (vs. sector 12%).\n- Edge Compute: 10-15% by 2027, capturing 20% of $10B AI edge TAM.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (2024 Est.) | Akamai (AKAM) | Cloudflare (NET) | Fastly (FSLY) | AWS CloudFront |\n|--------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Rev ($B)**      | 3.95 (FY24 guide) | 1.65            | 0.55         | N/A (part of AWS ~100) |\n| **Security Growth**| 13% YoY      | 35%             | 20%          | 25%            |\n| **Gross Margin**  | 80.5%        | 78%             | 65%          | ~70%           |\n| **EV/Rev Multiple**| 3.2x         | 15x             | 4x           | N/A            |\n| **Strength**      | Enterprise DDoS/hybrid cloud | SMB/zero-trust  | Streaming    | Cost/scale     |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships**: NVIDIA (AI edge, Sept 2024); Microsoft Azure (Sep 2023 multi-year); Google Cloud (edge integration); Snowflake (data protection).\n- **M&A**: Linode ($900M, Feb 2022); Guardicore ($600M, Oct 2021); non-binding LOI for F5's application security (Sep 2023, terminated May 2024). $1.7B cash hoard for future deals.\n- **Major Clients (Named)**: Adobe, Apple, BBC, BMW, eBay, ESPN, Facebook, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, Microsoft, NFL, Nintendo, Red Bull, Tencent, Twitter/X, Verizon (Q2 2024 10-K filings).\n- **Potential Clients**: Telcos/govt for 5G edge (e.g., Verizon expansion); AI hyperscalers outsourcing security.\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold with Upside Bias)**: Security growth and AI edge position AKAM for 8-10% CAGR through 2026 (vs. market 5%), but CDN weakness caps multiples. Trading at 3.2x FY25 EV/Rev (discount to peers); undervalued for moderate-risk growth portfolio.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $115** (23% upside): DCF-based (10% WACC, 9% revenue CAGR, 30% terminal multiple) using Q2 data; aligns with consensus PT $108 (FactSet, 18 analysts, Oct 2024). Strong buy if Q3 beats on security.",

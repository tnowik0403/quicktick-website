Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company operates seven complex refineries across the Mid-Continent, Southwest, and Rockies regions with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 678,000 barrels per day (bpd). These facilities produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, and other refined products distributed through a network of over 1,800 branded stations under names like Sinclair, Shell, and HF Sinclair. Beyond refining, HF Sinclair has diversified into lubricants (via Sonneborn acquisition), renewable diesel (670 million gallons annual capacity across multiple plants), and asphalt technologies.\n\nFormed in 2022 via the $8B merger of HollyFrontier and Sinclair Oil Holdings, HF Sinclair emphasizes high-complexity refining (Nelson Complexity Index average ~11.5), cost discipline, and sustainability initiatives like renewable fuels. It serves retail, commercial, and industrial markets, with ~55% of refined products sold into the Rockies and Mid-Continent where it holds regional advantages. The company reported Q2 2024 throughput of 678,000 bpd and remains resilient amid volatility through hedging and logistics assets like 3,900 miles of pipelines and terminals.

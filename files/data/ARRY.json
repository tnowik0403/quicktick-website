(ARRY) is a leading independent designer, manufacturer, and seller of solar tracking systems and related solar plant infrastructure for utility-scale solar projects worldwide. Headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and founded in 1987, the company specializes in single-axis trackers that optimize solar panel tilt to maximize energy yield, typically boosting production by 10-25% over fixed-tilt systems. Its flagship DuraTrack® HZ v3.0 tracker dominates its portfolio, supporting over 25 GW of installed capacity globally as of Q2 2024. Array serves the explosive growth in renewable energy, particularly utility-scale solar, driven by U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives and global net-zero goals. With manufacturing in the U.S., Spain, and India, it emphasizes American-made components to qualify for IRA tax credits (up to 45% domestic content bonus). The company reported a record Q2 2024 backlog of $2.3B, signaling strong multi-year visibility amid ~50 GW annual U.S. solar additions. Challenges include supply chain volatility and interest rate sensitivity, but Array's 20%+ U.S. market share positions it as a key enabler in the $100B+ global tracker market, projected to grow 15-20% CAGR through 2030.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 1, 2024):** Revenue $173.8M (beat consensus $157.2M est., +47% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $64.5M (margin 37.1%); GAAP EPS $0.08 (adj. $0.15 vs. est. $0.11).

Growth Strategy\n\n**Joint Ventures and Strategic Partnerships:**\n- The Samsung partnership is expected to contribute \"half point to a point of growth annually\" starting in 2026, while Ariston adds value in 2027.\n- In a strategic move to expand its product offerings and capture a larger share of the ductless HVAC market, Lennox International has partnered with Samsung to introduce 'Lennox Powered by Samsung' mini-split and VRF product lineups. This joint venture, named Samsung Lennox HVAC North America, combines the strengths of both companies to deliver innovative ductless heating and cooling solutions. The joint venture has unveiled its first ductless heat pump offerings: the Lennox Powered by Samsung mini-split systems and the Varix™ variable refrigerant flow (VRF) lineup for Lennox customers through the Lennox sales channels.\n\n**Acquisitions and Market Expansion:**\n- Lennox announced it has signed a definitive agreement to purchase the HVAC division of NSI Industries from Sentinel Capital Partners for approximately $550 million. This market-leading HVAC platform includes Duro Dyne, Supco, and other leading critical component and accessories brands. The acquisition enhances Lennox's ability to deliver a comprehensive, integrated portfolio of parts and supplies supported by enhanced digital and distribution capabilities across North America that elevate the customer experience.\n\n**Multi-Year Growth Vectors:**\n- Differentiated growth at Lennox International Inc. is driven by four growth vectors: heat pump penetration, emergency replacement share gains, higher attachment rates for parts and services, and total addressable market expansion through joint ventures such as Samsung and Ariston.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nLennox serves diverse market segments:\n\n**Distribution Model:**\n- Lennox sells approximately 75% of its HCS products directly to independent installing dealers through its Lennox Stores network, bypassing traditional wholesale distributors. Eliminating a margin layer enables faster inventory turns and creates captive distribution that competitors cannot easily replicate.\n- It sells its products and services through direct sales, distributors, and company-owned parts and supplies stores.\n\n**Market Segmentation:**\n- Lennox International manufactures and distributes heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration products to replacement (75% of sales) and new construction (25% of sales) markets.\n- In fiscal 2024, residential HVAC was 67% of sales and commercial HVAC and Heatcraft refrigeration was 33% of sales.\n\n**Commercial Services Growth:**\n- Our bolt-on acquisition of AES Industries in 2023 helped accelerate the attachment of commercial services and was a tremendous success based on financial and strategic metrics. As a result, our commercial services business has more than doubled over the past three years.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**2024 Full Year Results:**\n- Revenue $5.3 billion – Core revenue up 13%, including 2% growth from acquisitions. GAAP diluted EPS $22.54 – Adjusted diluted EPS up 26% to $22.58. Net cash from operations was $946 million – Free cash flow was $785 million, up 61%.\n- In 2024, Lennox International's revenue was $5.34 billion, an increase of 7.21% compared to the previous year's $4.98 billion. Earnings were $806.90 million, an increase of 36.74%.\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Lennox reported third quarter financial results with $1.4 billion of revenue, $310 million of operating income, and $6.98 GAAP diluted earnings per share. Revenue declined 5% to $1.4 billion. Segment profit increased 2% to $310 million. Segment margin was up 150 basis points to 21.7%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $6.98.\n\n**2025 Full Year Guidance:**\n- Despite a challenging market environment in 2025, Lennox is projecting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $22.75 and $23.25, even as they anticipate a full-year revenue decline of around 1% due to industry destocking and regulatory transitions. The revised adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) guidance for FY 2025 is still a strong range of $22.75 to $23.25.\n- The company lowered its free cash flow expectation for FY 2025 to $550 million, down from an earlier, more optimistic range.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Headwinds:**\n- The broader market drivers create both headwinds and tailwinds. On one side, elevated interest rates have crushed housing turnover and new construction, reducing replacement demand.\n- CEO Maskara commented on ongoing channel destabilization: \"Ongoing channel inventory rebalancing and weak dealer confidence following the regulatory transition created more complexity for the quarter.\"\n- Lennox International has seen its shares slip in recent weeks amid concerns over declining operating income and the escalating impact of tariffs on its profitability. The HVAC and climate control specialist reported a 7% year-over-year drop in Q1 2025 operating income to $156 million, with margins compressing by 140 basis points to 14.5%.\n\n**Strategic Tailwinds:**\n- On the other, electrification trends, data center cooling needs, and energy efficiency regulations are expanding the addressable market. Lennox's strategy—maintaining margins during the downturn while investing in heat pumps, parts attachment, and commercial services—positions it to capture disproportionate share when these cyclical headwinds abate.\n- Long-term, climate-driven demand is a tailwind.\n- The Inflation Reduction Act's incentives for energy-efficient HVAC systems also create tailwinds, as Lennox's product lineup is primed to benefit.\n\n**Regulatory Transition Advantage:**\n- The company has successfully navigated the R-454B refrigerant transition, with approximately 90% of refrigerant-based product sales now using the new low-GWP formulation, driving favorable product mix and positioning LII to capture market share as competitors struggle with execution and dealer confidence issues.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Overall Market Position:**\n- In the residential HVAC market, Lennox maintains approximately 15% market share in North America.\n- The North American HVAC system market is highly competitive, with five main players collectively accounting for 35–40% of the total market share. Carrier (US) has built a strong presence with its broad portfolio of advanced heating, cooling, and ventilation solutions.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\n- In the North American HVAC space, Lennox International competes fiercely with two other giants, Carrier Global and Trane Technologies, and is definitely seen as the premium brand among contractors. While LII has a smaller overall market share, its focus on product innovation and a strong dealer network gives it a distinct advantage in the high-margin residential and light commercial segments.\n\n**Ductless Market Opportunity:**\n- The Samsung partnership brings ductless mini-splits and VRF products to both HCS and BCS segments, addressing a market where industry ductless penetration approaches 10% but Lennox's current share is only 2%.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- Primary competitors include CARR (Carrier Global Corporation), TT (Trane Technologies), JCI (Johnson Controls), and DHR (Daikin Industries).\n- Rheem, Carrier Global, Panasonic Compressor (Dalian), Daikin Industries, and Mitsubishi Electric are some of the 13 competitors of Lennox International.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Lennox International's Q3 2025 segment margins expanded to 22.2% in Home Comfort Solutions and 26.1% in Building Climate Solutions despite a 5% consolidated revenue decline, demonstrating pricing power and operational excellence that differentiate it from margin-compressing competitors like Carrier (CARR) and Johnson Controls (JCI). LII's direct-to-contractor distribution model, representing approximately 75% of Home Comfort Solutions revenue, provides a durable competitive moat that enables faster market response, higher-margin parts sales, and stronger dealer loyalty compared to competitors reliant on wholesale distribution.\n\n**Market Performance vs. Competitors:**\n- While competitors like Carrier saw GAAP operating profit decline 29% year-over-year in Q3, Lennox expanded margins, implying superior business model resilience.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Major Acquisitions:**\n- Lennox completed the acquisition of the HVAC division of NSI Industries on October 16, 2025, adding the Duro Dyne and Supco brand platforms to its parts and supplies portfolio.\n- The recent acquisition of Durodyne and Subco will help accelerate attachment of parts and accessories across both HCS and BCS segments. The acquired business has annual revenues of approximately $225 million and a solid growth trajectory with strong margins. This acquisition meets our disciplined criteria and will be accretive in 2026.\n\n**Strategic Joint Ventures:**\n- Strategic investments during the cyclical downturn—including the $546 million Duro Dyne/Supco acquisition for parts attachment and joint ventures with Samsung (SSNLF) (ductless/VRF) and Ariston (heat pump water heating)—create multi-year growth vectors that will accelerate as channel inventory normalizes and housing markets recover in 2026.\n\n**Partnership Timeline:**\n- Lennox International's most recent deal was a Joint Venture with Ariston Lennox Water Heating North America. The deal was made on 16-Oct-2025.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q4 2025 and 2026 Guidance:**\n- Q4 2025 Lennox Earnings Conference Call scheduled for Jan 28, 2026.

Key recognitions include placement in the top 50 for financial strength and top 100 for customer satisfaction.\n\n**Community Initiatives:**\n- Feel The Love, sponsored by the LII Lennox Foundation, celebrates 16 years of community impact with the donation of HVAC equipment to homeowners and nonprofits in need.\n- Lennox donated 402 heating and cooling units to homeowners and nonprofits across North America through its Feel The Love program on Nov. 19, 2025. Installation Week ran Oct. 3–12 with Lennox dealers volunteering across 46 U.S. states and several Canadian provinces.

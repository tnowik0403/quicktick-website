(LII) is a leading global provider of climate control solutions, primarily focused on heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), and refrigeration products. Founded in 1895 and headquartered in Richardson, Texas, the company operates through three main segments: Residential Heating & Cooling (55% of 2023 revenue), Commercial Heating & Cooling (25%), and Refrigeration (20%). LII designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of energy-efficient furnaces, air conditioners, heat pumps, packaged rooftop units, chillers, and refrigeration systems for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Its products are sold via a network of ~6,000 independent distributors and company-owned stores under brands like Lennox, Armstrong Air, Ducane, and Heatcraft.  \n\nIn 2023, LII generated $4.98B in revenue, with strong margins driven by premium products and digital manufacturing. The company benefits from secular tailwinds like electrification, energy efficiency mandates, and data center growth, but faces cyclical housing and construction headwinds. LII invests heavily in R&D (~3% of revenue), smart IoT-enabled systems, and sustainability, positioning it for the shift to low-GWP refrigerants and heat pumps. With a focus on North America (90%+ revenue), LII holds a ~10-12% U.S. residential HVAC market share, emphasizing variable capacity technology for superior efficiency. Recent earnings highlight resilience amid soft demand, with Q3 2024 revenue of $1.48B (-4% YoY) but EPS of $5.33 (beat estimates by 9%).

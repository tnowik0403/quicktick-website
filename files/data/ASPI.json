Company Overview\n\nASP Isotopes Inc. is a development stage advanced materials company specializing in the production and commercialization of rare and enriched isotopes used in medicine, clean energy, and quantum applications. The company operates in two segments: Nuclear Fuels, and Specialist Isotopes and Related Services. ASP Isotopes Inc. was incorporated in 2021 and is based in Washington, District of Columbia.\n\nThe company offers the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) technology, which separates gas species and isotopes in a volatile state; and the Quantum Enrichment (QE) technology, which separates isotopes. Its proprietary technologies are designed to enable the production of isotopes used in several industries. The Nuclear Fuels segment focuses on the research and development of technologies and methods used to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and Lithium-6 for the advanced nuclear fuels target end market. Its Specialist Isotopes and Related Services segment engages in the research and development of technologies and methods used to separate high-value, low-volume isotopes, such as C-14, Mo-100 and Si-28, for target end markets, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, nuclear medical imaging, and semiconductors; provision of related services; and operation of PET labs.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company produces and commercializes Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, and Ytterbium-176 for the nuclear medical industry. In addition, the company develops Zinc-67/68, Nickel-64, and Xenon 129/136 for the nuclear medical industry; Lithium-7, Uranium-235, and Chlorine-37 for the energy industry; and Germanium-70/72/74 for semiconductor markets.\n\nThe Company has two isotope enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa. The first is a facility dedicated to the enrichment of isotopes of elements with a low atomic mass (light isotopes) and will initially produce Carbon-14. PET Labs continues to make continued progress and is on track to dispense a record number of doses in 2025. PET Labs continues to deliver outstanding progress with its second cyclotron operational as of July following an 18-month commissioning phase. With its current cyclotron already operating at peak utilisation, frequently completing four production runs nightly, the business is meeting record demand.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nBased on the operational results of the first Quantum Enrichment facility, the Company is accelerating plans to construct enrichment facilities in South Africa for many more isotopes using the QE process. In addition, the Company has started the procurement process for long lead time equipment to deliver four new laser production plants, which we plan to construct, starting in the first quarter of 2026. The Company has recently received the first of the required permits to import controlled laser equipment for the enrichment of Nickel-64, Gadolinium-160 and Zinc-68.\n\nThe company is pursuing a uranium‑235 HALEU fuel opportunity. The Company intends to construct its initial HALEU production facility at Pelindaba, subject to the receipt of all required permits and licenses to begin enrichment of uranium in South Africa. Pelindaba is South Africa's main nuclear research center, the headquarters of Necsa (South African Nuclear Energy Corporation) and is the home of the 20MW research nuclear reactor, SAFARI-1. The new uranium enrichment facility is designed to produce HALEU with an annual output of approximately 15 MTU of HALEU.\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nAfter four years of hard work, the Company is now transitioning from primarily a research and development company to a commercial organization and the goal of the Company during the next five years is to accelerate the industrialization of the processes that we have created and maximize production volumes and revenues. ASP Isotopes is transitioning from development stage to early commercialization.\n\nASP Isotopes also expects to develop a standalone enrichment and production facility for a suite of critical stable isotopes, such as Silicon-28, Germanium-70, and Xenon-129. The company's strategy includes expanding geographically beyond South Africa to facilities in Iceland and the United States.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe Company has already entered into two purchase agreements with US-based customers for kilogram quantities of Silicon-28 and is in discussions with multiple other global customers for kilogram quantities. The first is with a U.S.-based semiconductor company. The second is with a U.S.-based industrial gas company.\n\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into multiple definitive agreements with TerraPower, a US nuclear innovation company, related to financing support for the construction of a new uranium enrichment facility capable of producing High Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU). Bill Gates' nuclear company, TerraPower, has partnered with ASPI to fuel its next-gen reactors.\n\nASP Isotopes announced a purchase order for enriched Barium-137 from a U.S.-based customer, which aligns with ASP Isotopes' broader multi-isotope, multi-use, multi-customer electronic gases strategy.\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results (Q3 2025)\nTotal revenue reached $4.9 million for the quarter and $7.2 million for the first nine months of 2025, up from $2.95 million a year earlier, driven by both product and new construction services revenue. ASP Isotopes (ASPI) reported fiscal 2025 Q3 earnings on Nov 19, 2025, revealing a 349.5% surge in revenue to $4.89 million year-over-year.\n\nASP Isotopes's losses deepened to $0.15 per share in 2025 Q3 from a loss of $0.12 per share in 2024 Q3. The company's net loss widened to $-12.89 million in 2025 Q3, a 75.3% increase from the $-7.36 million loss in 2024 Q3. The company reported a net loss from operations of $34.9 million for the year-to-date 2025, compared to $18.7 million in 2024.\n\n### Historical Performance\nIn 2024, ASP Isotopes's revenue was $4.14 million, an increase of 857.04% compared to the previous year's $433,026. Losses were -$35.11 million, 115.6% more than in 2023.\n\n### Current Market Metrics\nAs of today, ASP Isotopes Inc(ASPI) shares are valued at $8.61. The company's market cap stands at 1.06B, with a P/E ratio of -5.95. The current price of ASPI is 8.48 USD — it has increased by 4.31% in the past 24 hours. ASP Isotopes Inc. EBITDA is ‪−41.20 M‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is −624.54%.\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\nIsotopes have one of the most severely compromised supply chains of any material in the world. Currently, supply is almost totally controlled by Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation, the Russian state-owned entity headquartered in Moscow, and a handful of state-owned or controlled enrichers. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) and every other Western government identifies isotopes as a critical material.\n\nThere is a growing demand for isotopes such as Silicon-28, which will enable quantum computing, and Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, and Nickel-64 for new, emerging healthcare applications, as well as Chlorine-37, Lithium-6, and Uranium-235 for green energy applications.\n\nWith Fermi America's ambitious plans to deliver over 11 GW with 6 GW of nuclear generation to power AI infrastructure and data centres, QLE is positioned as a future supplier of critical fuel and an enabler of the world's most advanced energy and data ecosystems. This convergence of regulatory progress, industrial partnerships, and robust market demand positions QLE to be part of the global nuclear renaissance.\n\n### Headwinds\nGiven the nature of the business, ASPI must go through rigorous regulatory and licensing procedures which can take time and delay commercialisation timelines. The core business operates out of South Africa which has experienced periods of political unrest and protests, often driven by issues such as corruption, unemployment, and inequality.\n\nThese figures highlight how dependent the business currently is on external financing rather than internally generated cash. Management states that cash and these proceeds should fund operations for more than 12 months from issuance of the financial statements, though execution on planned plants and technology scale‑up will determine how far that runway ultimately extends.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nCompetition is limited with Russia accounting for 85% of global isotope production, providing ASPI with strong geopolitical tailwinds as demand for alternative suppliers grows amid concerns about supply chain stability. Currently, there is no Western producer of HALEU, and the NEI (Nuclear Energy Institute) estimates that there will be a global demand of 3,000 metric tons by 2035.\n\nThe company is positioned to capture significant market share as it becomes one of the few Western alternatives to Russian-dominated isotope supply chains. No Western company currently produces HALEU uranium or high-purity medical isotopes at commercial scale, making ASPI the only viable alternative to Russian supply chains.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe primary direct competitor mentioned is Silex Systems (ASX: SLX). Silex is a joint venture with Cameco, which is the second largest producer of Uranium in the world. The company is owned 49% by Cameco with another call option to buy 25% of the company at fair market value. Their facilities are not expected to hit commercial viability until 2029 or later for uranium (1+ years after ASPI) and 2027 or later for Silicon and Ytterbium-176 (3-4 years after ASPI).\n\nASPI believes that they will be able to outperform them due to their high selectivity via Quantum Enrichment. This higher selectivity will allow them to perform enrichment in one stage instead of a cascade of lasers. The selectivity for Quantum Enrichment for uranium is 678 vs less than 50 for Laser enrichment (both AVLIS and MLIS).\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Major Recent Acquisition\nASP Isotopes Inc. (Nasdaq: ASPI) has successfully closed its previously announced acquisition of Renergen Limited on January 7, 2026, creating a combined company that is focused on the production of critical isotopes and helium. This strategic acquisition integrates ASP Isotopes' advanced enrichment technologies with Renergen's established helium and natural gas operations, positioning the combined company to address escalating demand in high-technology sectors. ASP Isotopes, with the acquisition of Renergen, is expected to become a global provider of liquid helium, one of the most sought-after critical minerals globally.\n\nThe combined company expects $750 million of debt funding: $500 million senior DFC facility and a $250 million Standard Bank facility.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\nInvestors will also spend a morning at Pelindaba, the operational base of Necsa (South African Nuclear Engineering Corporation), which is the site where the planned joint venture between ASP Isotopes, Quantum Leap Energy and Necsa expects to construct their first advanced nuclear fuels production facility.\n\nWorking with partners such as NECSA, TerraPower and Fermi America, the Company is well positioned to be a major beneficiary of tomorrow's megatrends.\n\n## 11.

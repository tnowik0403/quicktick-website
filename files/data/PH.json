Founded in 1917 and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, the company operates through two main segments: Aerospace Systems (32% of FY2024 sales) and Diversified Industrial (68%). Aerospace provides filtration, fluid conveyance, and fuel systems for commercial and military aircraft, while Diversified Industrial encompasses motion technologies like hydraulics, pneumatics, electromechanical systems, and filtration for North American and international industrial markets, including factory automation, life sciences, and energy. With ~58,000 employees across 50+ countries, Parker serves OEMs and end-users in aerospace, industrial manufacturing, oil & gas, and alternative energy. FY2024 revenue reached a record $19.93 billion (up 4.4% YoY), driven by commercial aerospace recovery and acquisitions. The company emphasizes its \"Win Strategy,\" focusing on distributed products (higher-margin, ~70% of sales), segment alignment, and M&A to deliver organic growth +1-3% and EPS expansion.

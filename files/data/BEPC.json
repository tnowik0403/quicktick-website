Key growth drivers include a landmark 10.5 GW Microsoft partnership (2026-2030), inflation-linked revenue (70%), and projected 8-13% annual FFO per share growth through 2029. Recent acquisitions of Westinghouse Electric and Neoen strengthen its position. However, high leverage, emerging-market currency exposure, and execution risks on its ambitious development pipeline present material headwinds.\n\n**Rating: 7.5/10; Fair Value: $45-48.** Strong AI/data center demand tailwinds and secured growth visibility justify premium valuation, but financial leverage moderates upside potential."

(NYSE: FNF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $58.52 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $15.85 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $42.29 - $59.69  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, FNF Investor Relations (investor.fnf.com), Seeking Alpha, Bloomberg, ALTA (American Land Title Association), Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript (July 23, 2024), recent articles from Reuters, HousingWire (Oct 2024), and Barron's (Sept 2024). All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 10-Q (filed August 7, 2024) and earnings release.\n\n## Company Overview (212 words)\nFidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF) is a leading provider of title insurance, trust services, and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries in the United States. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FNF underwrites title insurance policies through subsidiaries like Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company, and Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, protecting buyers, lenders, and investors against title defects. Beyond core title insurance, FNF offers escrow and closing services, appraisal management, and flood determination services via platforms like its Technology Services segment. The company also operates a Corporate and Other segment including trust services through FNTI and investment income from its portfolio. With a network spanning all 50 states, FNF benefits from high barriers to entry in the fragmented title insurance market, where it processes millions of real estate transactions annually. In 2023, FNF closed approximately 20% of U.S. residential purchase transactions (per ALTA data). The firm has evolved from pure title insurance into a diversified services provider, leveraging technology for efficiency amid cyclical real estate volumes. FNF's scale, with direct operations in key markets, positions it to capture share during housing recovery cycles, though it remains sensitive to mortgage origination volumes tied to interest rates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 23, 2024):** Revenue $2,948 million (+3% YoY); Net earnings $282 million ($1.03 diluted EPS); Title segment revenue $2,435 million; Pretax title pretax earnings $364 million (15% pretax margin).

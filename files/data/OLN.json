Founded in 1892 and headquartered in Gales Ferry, Connecticut, Olin generates revenue primarily from essential industrial chemicals like chlorine, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), which are used in water treatment, pulp & paper, agriculture, and PVC production. The Epoxy segment produces downstream epoxy resins for protective coatings, composites, adhesives, and electronics. Winchester, acquired in 2009, is a premier brand in ammunition and reloading components, serving military, law enforcement, hunting, and sporting markets. With 13 manufacturing sites across the US and international operations, Olin reported $6.8 billion in trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, cost discipline, and capacity optimization amid cyclical commodity pricing. In 2023, Chlor Alkali/Vinyls accounted for ~55% of sales, Epoxy ~25%, and Winchester ~20%. Olin navigates volatile input costs (e.g., natural gas, power) and end-market demand, positioning itself as a low-cost producer via membrane cell technology upgrades. Recent strategic focus includes epoxy market share gains and Winchester volume growth, though chemical pricing weakness has pressured margins.

Divested non-core assets (e.g., Dyno Nobel stake 2016).\n- **Major Clients**: Chemical - Olin's own Vinyls/Epoxy loop (40% captive); external: pulp (Georgia-Pacific), ag (Nutrien). Epoxy - aerospace (Boeing suppliers), coatings (Sherwin-Williams). Winchester - US Military (Fort Liberty), Walmart/Dicks Sporting Goods.\n- **Potential**: Defense primes (RTX/Lockheed) for expanded ammo; green H2 projects needing chlorine byproducts.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold/Buy on Dips)**. Cyclical recovery potential from membrane upside and Winchester strength outweighs near-term chemical weakness. Moderate risk via debt/cyclicals balanced by 15-20% FCF yield.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $52 (25% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth; $900M 2025 EBITDA); aligns with 9-10x EV/EBITDA peer avg on normalized $1B EBITDA. Strong growth for portfolios: 10-15% annual returns via pricing rebound + dividends/buybacks. Entry below $42.",

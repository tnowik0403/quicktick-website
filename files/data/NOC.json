Founded in 1939, it operates through four primary segments: Aeronautics Systems (autonomous aircraft like the B-21 Raider bomber), Space Systems (satellites, launch vehicles, and strategic missiles), Mission Systems (cyber, C4ISR, and radar systems), and Defense Systems (missile defense, submarines, and nuclear modernization). NOC is a key U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) prime contractor, contributing to programs like the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) and Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD). With a record backlog exceeding $80 billion, the company leverages cutting-edge technologies in hypersonics, AI, and autonomous systems to address geopolitical threats from China and Russia. In FY2023, NOC generated $39.3 billion in sales, focusing on high-margin, long-cycle programs amid rising global defense spending. Its innovation pipeline positions it as a leader in contested domains, though it faces execution risks in fixed-price contracts.

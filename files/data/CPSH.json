Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Norton, MA, the company serves high-growth sectors including power electronics, aerospace & defense, energy, transportation (EV/HEV), and oil & gas. Its core technology enables lightweight, high-performance components that manage thermal loads, vibration, and weight in mission-critical applications. Key products include baseplates and housings for IGBT power modules, phase change material (PCM) heat spreaders (PhaseGuide HD®), HybridTech Armor® vehicle armor, and microchannel cold plates for liquid cooling. CPSH operates a 60,000 sq ft facility with ISO 9001/AS9100 certifications. In FY2023 (ended Dec 31, 2023), it generated $27.6M in revenue, driven by demand for EV power modules and defense contracts. Recent quarters show accelerating growth amid AI data center cooling and electrification trends, positioning CPSH as a niche enabler for next-gen semiconductors and power systems from partners like Infineon and Mitsubishi Electric.\n\n**Recent Developments** (with dates)  \n- **August 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (quarter ended June 30): Revenue $7.48M (+29% YoY from $5.81M), gross margin 16.4% (up from 13.1%), net income $0.48M or $0.04/share (vs. $0.18M loss prior year).

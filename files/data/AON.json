Here again, Aon is seeking more integration around a business services and analytics platform that will create leverage, support new product development and supercharge margins.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n### Aon United Strategy and 3x3 Plan\nOur Aon United strategy, accelerated through our 3x3 Plan, is delivering strong results. We are attracting top talent in high-growth areas, scaling our data analytics across our core Risk Capital and Human Capital businesses, expanding in the middle market and unlocking new sources of capital,\" said Greg Case, president and CEO.\n\nOur 3x3 Plan is enabling our firm to accelerate our Aon United strategy with a focus on three commitments over the next three years: Leveraging Risk Capital and Human Capital to unlock new integrated solutions across our core business that address emerging client demand; Embedding the Aon Client Leadership model across our Enterprise Client and Large & Middle Market segments to further strengthen and expand our client relationships; Accelerating our Aon Business Services plan to set a new standard for service delivery and next generation analytical tools\n\nThe firm's Accelerating Aon United Strategy and 3x3 Plan—focused on client-centricity, operational excellence, and capital allocation—are not just buzzwords. They represent a seismic shift in how risk and human capital are managed, underpinned by an industrial-strength platform that's driving revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. Aon's 3x3 Plan, unveiled at its 2025 Investor Day, is a three-year roadmap designed to unlock value by aligning its operations with the evolving needs of clients. The three pillars—client-centricity, operational excellence, and capital allocation—are interlinked, but the true engine behind this strategy is Aon's industrial-strength platform.\n\n### Capital Allocation\nAon's 3x3 Plan also emphasizes disciplined capital allocation. The firm has used its free cash flow to reduce debt, fund strategic acquisitions (such as NFP), and return capital to shareholders. The integration of NFP, for instance, has expanded Aon's human capital capabilities, creating a virtuous cycle: enhanced analytics drive client retention, which in turn fuels organic growth.\n\n## 6.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n**Growing Demand for Cyber Insurance**: Cyber risk continues to dominate the insurance sector's risk landscape and is growing in complexity. Insurers face dual exposure: protecting their own operations and underwriting cyber risk for clients.\n\n**Climate Change as Growth Driver**: As a result of higher exposure and climate shifts, weather-related disasters are not only more frequent than they used to be — they are also more destructive. In 2024 alone, global natural disasters resulted in $368 billion in economic losses, with only 40 percent insured.\n\n**Data Analytics Advantage**: Utilizing advanced analytics and predictive modeling, Aon processes over 2.5 petabytes of risk data annually.\n\n### Headwinds\n**Competitive Pricing Pressure**: The company faces pricing pressure in certain products and geographies, which could impact future revenue growth.\n\n**Talent Competition**: There is increased competition for talent, with competitors aggressively recruiting, which could affect Aon PLC (AON)'s ability to attract and retain top performers.\n\n**Reinsurance Market Pressure**: The reinsurance market is experiencing pressure on rates, particularly in the property sector, which could impact future growth in this segment.\n\n**Geopolitical Risks**: For the first time in the survey's 19-year history, geopolitical volatility entered the top 10 global risks, rising sharply from its 2023 position. The risk now sits alongside issues such as business interruption, regulatory change and economic slowdown, reflecting growing instability across trade flows, supply chains and financial performance.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIn 2024, Aon maintained its second position globally with a revenue of $15.7 billion, directly challenging Marsh McLennan's market leadership. WTW and AJG also secured spots in the top four global insurance brokers for 2024, reporting revenues of $9.93 billion and $11.30 billion, respectively.\n\nMarsh McLennan – $22.7 billion; Aon – $13.4 billion; Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. – $9.91 billion; Willis Towers Watson (WTW) – $9.48 billion.\n\nTheir largest market share is in the Claims Adjusting industry, where they account for an estimated 24.4% of total industry revenue and are considered a Rising Star because they display lower market share, but displaying stronger profit and revenue growth than some of their peers.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors\nAon's competitors and similar companies include Marsh McLennan, Willis Towers Watson, Gallagher and JLT Group Holdings.\n\nTogether, Aon, WTW, and Marsh McLennan (\"Marsh\") tower above other firms—so much so that they are often referred to as the \"Big Three.\" The Big Three dominate competition for insurance broking for the largest companies in the United States, almost all of which are customers of at least one of them. Aon and WTW are the second- and third-largest insurance brokers in the world.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nHigh levels of concentration exist because customers view Aon and WTW—along with Marsh— as offering key advantages over other firms. First, through a mix of broad data, deep experience, knowledge, and institutional resources that outstrip smaller insurance brokers, Aon and WTW can customize their products to fit a particular client's unique needs. Second, Aon and WTW offer, and have deep talent across, the full range of commercial risk and employee benefits products and services, allowing them to provide advice and insights that would not be possible for a smaller firm with a narrower scope. Third, Aon and WTW have extensive global networks of offices that facilitate the provision of seamless worldwide service for multinational customers.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Major Divestiture\nAon plc announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell a significant majority of NFP's wealth business – Wealthspire Advisors, Fiducient Advisors, Newport Private Wealth and related platforms – to Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (\"MDP\"), a leading private equity investment firm based in Chicago. Under the terms of the transaction, MDP will acquire the businesses for a total consideration estimated to be $2.7 billion at the time of close, resulting in total after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close in late Q4 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. Given the expected timing of the close, the financial impact to Aon's full-year 2025 results i\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nAon's most recent acquisition is Griffiths & Armour, a Provider of satellite-based communication services, acquired in November 2024.\n\nLevelBlue has completed its acquisition of Aon's (NYSE: AON) Cybersecurity and IP Litigation consulting groups, including Stroz Friedberg and Elysium Digital. The strategic acquisition brings approximately 300 technology professionals with extensive relationships across Fortune 500 companies and major law firms. The deal strengthens LevelBlue's position as the world's largest independent pure-play Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP).\n\n### Failed Merger\nIn 2021, Aon agreed to merge with Willis Towers Watson; the merger agreement was terminated due to regulatory concerns.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Performance\nMeyer Shields, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW), said the broker's outperformance in organic growth and in all segments would likely boost shares. Indeed, Aon's shares were up by 5.10% at 11:15 a.m. EDT on Oct. 31.\n\n### Strategic Focus on Analytics\nOur Aon United strategy, accelerated through our 3x3 Plan, is delivering strong results,\" Case said. \"We are attracting top talent in high-growth areas, scaling our data analytics across our core Risk Capital and Human Capital businesses, expanding in the middle market and increasing the value we deliver to our clients – winning in existing markets, creating demand in emerging areas and innovating unique capital solutions.\"\n\n### Operational Efficiency\nAccelerating Aon United Restructuring Program expense decreased $37 million, or 54%, compared to the prior year period due to lower costs related to workforce optimization.\n\n### Technology Launch\n\"As cyber threats continue to grow in frequency, sophistication and severity, organizations face an array of complex risks—from ransomware and business interruption to insider threats and data breaches,\" said Christian Hoffman, global specialty and financial products leader for Aon. \"Compounding these risks are increased litigation pressures, shifting regulatory landscapes, and heightened scrutiny from shareholders. We designed Aon's Cyber Risk Analyzer to address these challenges and help clients evaluate and quantify their enterprise cyber risk, enabling them to make better decisions.\"\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.2/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $390-$410 per share**\n\n### Investment Thesis\nAon demonstrates strong fundamentals with consistent organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and robust cash generation.

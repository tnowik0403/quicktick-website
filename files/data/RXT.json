(NASDAQ: RXT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**  \n- Stock Price: $2.12  \n- Market Capitalization: $456.2 million  \n- 52-Week Range: $1.57 - $3.52  \n- Avg. Daily Volume (3 months): 1.34 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRackspace Technology, Inc. (RXT) is a leading provider of end-to-end multicloud technology services, specializing in managed hosting, public cloud management, professional services, and data services. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, the company pioneered the \"Fanatical Experience\" brand, offering 24/7 expert support for hybrid and multicloud environments across major hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Rackspace helps enterprises modernize IT infrastructure, migrate to the cloud, optimize workloads, and leverage emerging technologies like AI/ML and data analytics. With roots dating back to 1998 as a managed hosting provider using OpenStack for private cloud, Rackspace went public via a SPAC merger in August 2020. It serves over 2,000 customers, primarily large enterprises and midmarket firms in sectors like financial services, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. Revenue is segmented into Public Cloud (managed services on hyperscalers), Apps & Industry (application management and consulting), and Managed Hosting (traditional infrastructure). Despite a strong partner ecosystem, Rackspace faces revenue contraction amid hyperscaler competition and macroeconomic pressures, with FY2023 revenue at $3.4B (down 13% YoY) and ongoing restructuring to achieve profitability. The company employs ~6,000 people globally post-2023 layoffs.

Suitable for speculative turnaround plays only.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $2.80 (based on 8x FY2025E adjusted EBITDA of $300M implied by guidance/street consensus; 25% upside from $2.12 but moderate risk tolerance limits to conservative DCF amid execution risks). Portfolio with strong growth upside should avoid; monitor for profitability inflection.",

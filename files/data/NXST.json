(NXST) is the largest owner of local television stations in the United States, operating 197 full-power stations (including joint sales agreements) across 120 markets, reaching approximately 39% of U.S. TV households as of Q2 2024. The company generates revenue primarily through television broadcasting (local stations affiliated with ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and The CW), cable network programming via NewsNation, digital media properties (including The Hill, NewsNationNow.com, and Antenna TV), and syndication services. Nexstar's business model leverages retransmission consent fees from multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) like cable and satellite providers, which account for over 60% of revenue, alongside political and national advertising. In recent years, the company has expanded digitally, acquiring premium news sites and investing in OTT streaming via NewsNation+ and local station apps. Headquartered in Irving, Texas, Nexstar employs about 13,000 people and focuses on consolidating local media assets amid cord-cutting trends. With a market capitalization of $6.15 billion and a current stock price of $166.48 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance), NXST benefits from its scale in negotiating carriage deals but faces secular declines in linear TV viewership. The company's strategy emphasizes high-margin distribution revenue, election-year political ad windfalls, and digital diversification to offset advertising softness.

Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, with U.S. operations in Palo Alto, California, Jazz develops and commercializes medicines for serious, chronic conditions underserved by existing therapies. Its flagship franchise is the sodium oxybate portfolio (Xyrem and Xywav), which dominates the narcolepsy market with treatments for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Xywav, a lower-sodium alternative to Xyrem, has driven growth amid patent challenges on the original drug. In epilepsy, Epidiolex (cannabidiol) is a leader for rare seizure disorders like Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Oncology contributions come from Zepzelca (lurbinectedin) for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Jazz's revenue is predominantly U.S.-generated (95%+), with ~2,300 employees. The company emphasizes lifecycle management, label expansions (e.g., Xywav pediatrics), international launches, and a robust pipeline in neuroscience (e.g., JZP3771 for idiopathic hypersomnia) and oncology. Q2 2024 results showed net product sales of $700.8 million (up 9% YoY), GAAP net income of $156.6 million, and gross margins of 80.9%, reflecting disciplined R&D spend (~20% of revenue) and a focus on high-margin rare disease markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Total revenues $764.1M (+12% YoY); Xywav net sales $446.8M (+29% YoY); Epidiolex $153.6M (+5% YoY); Zepzelca $84.9M (+14% YoY); Xyrem $100.4M (-42% YoY due to generics).

hospitals (oncology); EU partners (e.g., Desitin for Epidiolex Germany).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold/Buy)** – Strong Xywav momentum and pipeline catalysts (suvorexant 2025) offset Xyrem risks; undervalued at 2.3x 2025 EV/Sales vs. peers 4x+. Moderate risk from generics/pipeline binary events suits growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $145 (29% upside) – DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% CAGR to 2028, 12x terminal multiple); aligns with consensus PT $152 (Barclays/Leerink Oct 2024).",

Existing Products/Services\n\n### Neuroscience Portfolio\n\n**Sleep Disorders:**\n- **Xywav® (low-sodium oxybate)**: The Xywav (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution product is for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in patients with narcolepsy seven years of age and older. Xywav is the only low-sodium oxybate, the #1 branded treatment for narcolepsy and the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy to treat IH.\n  \n- **Xyrem® (sodium oxybate)**: The Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution product is for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients with narcolepsy seven years of age and older.\n\n**Epilepsy:**\n- **Epidiolex® (cannabidiol)**: This acquisition added the medication Epidiolex (cannabidiol), developed to treat severe epilepsy syndromes, to the company's portfolio. Epidiolex/Epidyolex, a cannabidiol oral solution for rare epilepsies, demonstrated significant growth with net product sales of $972.4 million in 2024, a 15% increase.\n\n### Oncology Portfolio\n\n- **Rylaze®/Enrylaze® (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi)**: Jazz has nine approved drugs across neuroscience and oncology indications; its portfolio includes Xyrem and Xywav for narcolepsy, Zepzelca for the treatment of metastatic small cell lung cancer, Rylaze for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Vyxeos for acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n- **Zepzelca® (lurbinectedin)**: Treatment for metastatic small cell lung cancer\n\n- **Vyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine)**: Treatment for acute myeloid leukemia\n\n- **Defitelio® (defibrotide sodium)**: Treatment for veno-occlusive disease\n\n- **Ziihera® (zanidatamab-hrii)**: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval of Ziihera® (zanidatamab-hrii) 50mg/mL for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC), as detected by an FDA-approved test.\n\n- **Modeyso™**: Modeyso received accelerated approval from the FDA ahead of its PDUFA date; initiated commercial launch in August 2025 with strong initial uptake and sales of $11.0 million in 3Q25.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Late-Stage Pipeline Programs\n\n**Zanidatamab Development Program:**\n- Zanidatamab is also being investigated in a number of additional tumor types, including Phase 3 trials in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEAs) and metastatic breast cancer (mBC).\n- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) announced Monday that its Phase 3 HERIZON-GEA-01 trial evaluating Ziihera (zanidatamab-hrii) showed positive results in first-line treatment for HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The trial demonstrated that Ziihera plus chemotherapy, with or without the PD-1 inhibitor Tevimbra (tislelizumab), achieved statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival compared to the control arm of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.\n\n**Other Pipeline Programs:**\n- **Dordaviprone (from Chimerix acquisition)**: April 2025 (Chimerix Acquisition), adding dordaviprone to its late-stage pipeline.

  "tldr_summary": "Jazz Pharmaceuticals is a Dublin-based biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for sleep disorders, epilepsy, and oncology, with particular strength in narcolepsy and specialized cancer indications.\n\nThe company's revenue growth is driven by Xywav (narcolepsy, $431M in Q3 2025) and Epidiolex (epilepsy, $303M), which together represent its largest revenue streams. Jazz is pursuing aggressive pipeline expansion through zanidatamab, showing positive Phase 3 results across gastroesophageal and breast cancers, and recently acquired dordaviprone for rare brain tumors. Key risks include imminent Xyrem generic competition in 2026 and high R&D costs, though the company maintains dominant market positions in niche therapeutic areas with limited competition.\n\nThe AI rating of 7.8/10 with a $200-210 fair value is justified by strong cash generation, diversified growth drivers, and significant pipeline upside, though investors should monitor execution risks on late-stage programs."

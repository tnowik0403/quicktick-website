(GO) is a leading U.S. discount grocery retailer operating under the Grocery Outlet banner, specializing in a unique \"treasure hunt\" shopping experience. The company sources excess inventory, closeout deals, and overstock from name-brand manufacturers at significant discounts (often 40-70% off MSRP), passing savings to customers while maintaining a curated, ever-changing mix of products across dry grocery, dairy, perishables, general merchandise, health products, and private-label items. Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Emeryville, California, GO targets value-conscious shoppers in underserved markets, primarily in the Western U.S., with expansion into the Midwest and Southeast. As of Q2 2024, it operated 517 stores across 15 states, emphasizing independently operated stores with \"Buyer’s Choice\" model where merchant-owners select assortments. This opportunistic sourcing differentiates GO from traditional grocers, enabling high gross margins (around 40%) despite low average basket sizes. Annual sales exceed $4 billion, positioning GO as a nimble player in the fragmented $1+ trillion U.S. grocery market, capitalizing on economic uncertainty and inflation-driven thriftiness.

Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns with grocery defensiveness. Hold if risk-averse on macro slowdown.",

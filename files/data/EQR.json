As of Q3 2024 earnings (reported October 28, 2024), EQR owns or has investments in 579 properties consisting of approximately 216,000 apartment units across premium coastal U.S. markets with high barriers to entry, including New York City, Boston, San Francisco/Silicon Valley, Seattle, Washington D.C., and San Diego.

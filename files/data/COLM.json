Founded in 1938 and headquartered in Portland, Oregon, the company operates through four primary brands: Columbia (core outerwear and performance apparel), SOREL (premium footwear), Mountain Hardwear (technical mountaineering gear), and prAna (sustainable yoga and climbing apparel). With annual revenues around $3.4B (FY2023), COLM sells via wholesale (retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, REI) and direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (e-commerce and 140+ owned stores globally). The U.S. accounts for ~50% of sales, with growing exposure in EMEA (30%) and Asia-Pacific (20%). COLM emphasizes innovation (e.g., Omni-Heat tech for thermal regulation), sustainability (100% PFAS-free by 2024 goal), and omnichannel growth amid a $100B+ global outdoor market. Challenges include cyclical consumer spending on discretionary apparel, but strengths lie in brand loyalty, inventory discipline, and international expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 25, 2024)**: Net sales $273.5M (-11% YoY, verified via company 10-Q).

(MPW) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 14, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $4.55         |\n| Market Cap      | $2.77B        |\n| 52-Week High    | $6.55 (Nov 30, 2023) |\n| 52-Week Low     | $3.44 (Aug 5, 2024) |\n| Dividend Yield  | 13.2% (annualized $0.60/share, quarterly $0.15) |\n| Shares Outstanding | ~609M       |\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc. (MPW) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) focused primarily on acquiring, developing, and leasing healthcare real estate properties worldwide. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, MPW owns a diversified portfolio of over 400 facilities across the U.S., Europe, South America, and Australia, totaling approximately 40 million square feet. Its assets include acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities, post-acute care centers, and medical office buildings, leased under long-term net leases (average remaining term ~8-10 years) to third-party healthcare operators. This sale-leaseback model allows MPW to generate stable rental income while providing operators with capital for growth. As of Q2 2024, the portfolio was 94% occupied, with rents representing ~98% of normalized funds from operations (FFO). MPW targets investment-grade and high-credit tenants, emphasizing facilities in high-barrier-to-entry markets driven by aging demographics and healthcare demand. However, recent tenant distress, particularly with Steward Health Care (its largest tenant), has pressured liquidity and dividend sustainability, leading to asset sales and deleveraging efforts amid elevated interest rates.

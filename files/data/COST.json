It operates an international chain of membership warehouses, serving over 130 million cardholders across 905 warehouses as of Q1 FY2026 (606 in North America, 179 in EMEA, 179 in APAC). Costco's core model revolves around a low-margin, high-volume strategy, offering a curated selection of ~4,000 SKUs (vs. 30,000+ at supermarkets) focused on high-quality national brands and private-label Kirkland Signature products at aggressively low prices. Revenue streams include merchandise sales (merchandise/service sales ~97% of total), membership fees (~3%, recurring and high-margin at 90%+ renewal rates), and ancillary services like gas stations, pharmacies, optical centers, and travel. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, treasure-hunt merchandising (rotating limited-time offers), and member loyalty, driving comparable sales growth of 6.5% in Q1 FY2026 amid moderating inflation. With a debt-free balance sheet and $15.1B cash position, Costco targets middle-to-upper-income families seeking value, expanding digitally and internationally while maintaining a defensive moat through scale and membership stickiness.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Earnings Beat (Dec 12, 2025)**: Q1 FY2026 revenue $60.99B (up 7.5% YoY), net income $1.59B (up 12.8% YoY), EPS $3.58 (beat estimates by $0.16).

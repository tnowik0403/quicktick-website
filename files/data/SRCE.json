It provides a full suite of commercial banking, private banking, consumer banking, and wealth management services through its subsidiary, 1st Source Bank, with 82 branches primarily in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan. The company specializes in niche lending segments, including equipment finance (e.g., aviation, truck, and construction equipment), commercial real estate, agriculture, and healthcare lending, which differentiate it from broader regional peers. As of Q3 2024, total assets stood at $9.4 billion, with loans of $7.0 billion and deposits of $8.8 billion. 1st Source emphasizes relationship-based banking for small- to mid-sized businesses, municipalities, and high-net-worth individuals, supported by trust services managing $3.2 billion in assets under management. Its diversified revenue streams—57% from net interest income, 29% from noninterest income (fees from wealth management and specialty finance)—provide resilience amid interest rate volatility. Recent strategic focus includes digital enhancements and expansion in high-growth lending niches, positioning it for steady mid-single-digit growth in a consolidating regional banking sector.

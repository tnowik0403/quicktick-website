Growth Strategy\n\nMartin Marietta follows a comprehensive growth strategy centered on their SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives:\n\n**Portfolio Optimization**: This was accomplished through approximately $6 billion in aggregates-led acquisitions and non-core asset divestitures. These portfolio-optimizing transactions created a more durable business, increased the gross profit contribution from our core aggregates product line, and enhanced our margin profile, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet for continued acquisitive growth.\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions**: C. Howard Nye, CEO, stated that both acquisitions are pure aggregate bolt-ons, consistent with their strategic plan. They are margin accretive and add over 150 million tons of reserves in areas with shortages.\n\n**Geographic Focus**: Since then, growth has been driven by a relentless 'buy and build' strategy, focusing on high-growth markets, especially in the US South and West. Strategic Geographic Footprint: Operations are concentrated in high-growth, financially strong Sunbelt states and along major transportation corridors, providing a structural advantage over competitors.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMartin Marietta serves diverse end markets:\n\n**Public Sector**: The core aggregates business is insulated from private sector volatility because public sector construction (highway and infrastructure) accounts for approximately 50% of its aggregates and concrete sales, offering multi-year revenue visibility.\n\n**Infrastructure Projects**: The company benefits from federal infrastructure spending through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\n\n**Data Centers**: Additionally, the growing demand for data centers represents an emerging opportunity in the nonresidential sector.

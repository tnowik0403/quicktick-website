(NASDAQ: PRVA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $18.82\n- Market Capitalization: $2.26 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $15.22 - $23.84\n- Avg.

(PRIVA) is a physician enablement and population health technology company founded in 2007 and headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The company partners with primary care and specialty physician groups, health systems, and health plans to transform healthcare delivery toward value-based care (VBC) models. Privia's proprietary Privia Platform integrates technology-enabled services—including practice management, revenue cycle optimization, quality reporting, patient engagement tools, and data analytics—to enhance physician efficiency, improve clinical outcomes, and align incentives for risk-sharing contracts like Medicare Advantage (MA), ACO REACH, and commercial VBC.\n\nOperating across 13 markets in the U.S. (primarily East Coast and Texas), Privia supports over 4,900 providers as of Q2 2024, managing approximately 4.5 million patient lives. Revenue is derived from platform management fees (fee-for-service enhancements), transformation services, and risk-adjusted performance-based incentives. Privia does not own physician practices but enables independent groups through management services agreements (MSAs), allowing scalability without capital-intensive clinic ownership. In 2023, it achieved strong momentum in VBC penetration (39% of revenue), positioning it as a leader in the shift from fee-for-service to outcomes-based reimbursement amid rising MA enrollment (now ~50% of Medicare lives).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024; sourced from Privia IR and SEC 10-Q)**: Total revenue $1.46 billion (up 18.1% YoY); Platform revenue $100.7 million (up 9.9% YoY); Practice collections $1.36 billion (up 18.7% YoY).

(NYSE: BRT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 18, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $17.82 (as of market close October 18, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $343.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 18, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $16.49 - $20.63  \n**Sources:** Primary data from BRT investor relations, SEC filings (latest 10-Q filed August 14, 2024 for Q2 2024), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, REIT.com sector data, Google News/Benzinga articles (last 30 days), and earnings call transcripts (Q2 2024 call August 14, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nBRT Apartments Corp. is a self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, operation, and, to a lesser extent, development of multi-family properties. Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Great Neck, NY, BRT focuses primarily on high-growth Sun Belt markets, including Texas (Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin), Florida (Tampa, Orlando), and Georgia (Atlanta). As of Q2 2024, the company owns 29 multi-family properties with 7,947 units across these regions, plus two undeveloped land parcels totaling 65.1 acres for future development. BRT's strategy emphasizes value-add acquisitions—buying underperforming Class B properties, executing targeted renovations, and boosting net operating income (NOI) through operational improvements and rent growth. The portfolio is 95% occupied as of June 30, 2024, with average monthly rents at $1,544 per unit. BRT differentiates via a conservative balance sheet (debt-to-assets ~45%), no near-term maturities, and a focus on middle-market renters underserved by luxury competitors. Revenue is generated almost entirely from rental income (99%+), with ancillary fees from amenities like parking and utilities. In FY2023, BRT delivered 5.2% same-store NOI growth amid a challenging multifamily sector. The REIT maintains a quarterly dividend of $0.25/share (annualized 5.6% yield at current price), appealing to income investors, while pursuing growth through opportunistic buys in a normalizing rate environment.

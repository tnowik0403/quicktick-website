These solutions will be showcased alongside next-generation intelligent power distribution units at SC25.\n\nThe new joint architecture developed by Siemens and nVent is designed to help build 100 MW hyperscale AI data centers built to house large-scale, liquid-cooled AI infrastructure, such as NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nnVent is accelerating its shift toward high-value, long-cycle markets like data centers and utilities, with record backlog and strong double-digit growth in Data Solutions. We have increased our exposure to the high growth infrastructure vertical. We believe the infrastructure vertical has the highest growth opportunity with the trends of electrification, sustainability and digitalization.\n\n**Manufacturing Expansion:**\nIn early 2025, the company secured a 117,000-square-foot facility in Blaine, Minnesota, which will commence production in early 2026, focusing on next-generation liquid cooling products. This follows the June 2025 opening of a 140,000-square-foot plant in Anoka, Minnesota, which together are expected to create over 325 jobs and significantly boost output.\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions:**\nThe company's acquisition strategy further strengthens its competitive edge. The $975 million purchase of Avail Infrastructure Solutions' Electrical Products Group (EPG) in 2025 has enabled nVent to offer end-to-end data center infrastructure solutions.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, organic orders rose around 65% and management said most of this increase came from large liquid cooling orders for hyperscaler programs. The company now has visibility into 2026, with some programs extending into 2027, which suggests that customer spending plans remain firm.\n\n**Major Hyperscaler Relationships:**\n- Partnership with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Partner Network (NPN)\n- Collaboration with Google through the Open Compute Project\n- Strategic partnerships with Siemens for AI data center architecture\n- Work with major cloud service providers for liquid cooling deployments\n\nLarge hyperscalers, such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and even Meta and Tesla, are scrambling to integrate quantum computing into their infrastructure.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Financial Results:**\nWe had record sales and adjusted EPS in Q3. For the first time, quarterly sales were more than $1 billion. Adjusted EPS was $0.91. Both sales and EPS exceeded our guidance. We also had record orders and backlog in the quarter.\n\nSales of $1,054 million were up 35% relative to last year. Organically, sales grew 16%, driven largely by volume and an increase contribution from price.\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): Reported EPS of $0.73, exceeding the estimated $0.71, with adjusted EPS reaching $0.91, up 44% from the previous year. Free Cash Flow: Generated $253 million, a significant 77% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Operating Income: Increased by 25% to $166 million, with adjusted operating income rising 27% to $213 million. Cash Flows from Operations: Reached $272 million, reflecting a 72% growth from the prior year.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nThe full-year adjusted EPS range is $3.31-$3.33 (up 33%-34%); Q4 2025 adjusted EPS guidance is $0.87-$0.89, with the midpoint up nearly 50% year over year.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Increasing electrification and digitalization of the economy bode well for nVent. More than 70% of the company's portfolio is exposed to secular growth trends.\n- Less than 10% of data centers are liquid-cooled today, but new graphics processing unit chips require more advanced cooling, which supports long-term demand. nVent Electric has more than a decade of experience in this area and has deployed more than 1 gigawatt of cooling.\n- TrendForce's recent report states that the launch of NVIDIA's Blackwell platform is set to drive the adoption of liquid cooling solutions from around 10% in 2024 to over 20% in 2025.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- AI hardware's thermal demands create structural growth, but margin compression risks and emerging competitors challenge nVent's premium valuation.\n- Intense competition from established players in the electrical equipment market\n- Economic uncertainty affecting industrial and commercial construction markets\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nEnclosures: global top-3 share alongside Rittal and Schneider Electric; strong OEM and data-center footprint. Heat-trace: RAYCHEM is a global leader, often preferred in process/energy applications versus Thermon Group.\n\nThe data center power market is competitive, with Schneider Electric, ABB, Eaton, Vertiv, and Delta Electronics collectively accounting for approximately 41–43% of the total market share.\n\nBrand strength, global certifications, and channel reach drive share battles—nVent reported roughly $3.9B in revenue in 2024 while competitors operate at much larger scales.\n\n## 10.

It operates through three primary segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), which designs, manufactures, and delivers commercial jetliners like the 737, 767, 777, and 787 families; Defense, Space & Security (BDS), focusing on military aircraft, satellites, missiles, and rotorcraft such as the F-15, F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, and space systems including the Space Launch System (SLS) for NASA; and Global Services (BGS), providing aftermarket support, maintenance, training, and digital solutions. With a massive backlog exceeding $500 billion, Boeing serves airlines, governments, and defense organizations worldwide. The company has faced headwinds from the 737 MAX crises (2019 grounding and ongoing safety scrutiny post-2024 Alaska Airlines incident), supply chain disruptions, labor strikes, and regulatory pressures, but benefits from robust air travel demand recovery and elevated U.S. defense budgets. Boeing employs ~171,000 people and invests heavily in sustainable aviation technologies and production ramp-ups to regain market leadership against Airbus.

Risk: Prolonged delays → ↓5-10% if Airbus captures share.\n\n## Competitor Comparison (2023-2024 data)\n\n| Metric                  | Boeing (BA)          | Airbus (EADSY)       | Lockheed (LMT)       | RTX (RTX)            |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| **Rev ($B, 2023)**     | 77.8                | 70.8                | 67.6                | 68.9                |\n| **Commercial Delivs**  | 480 (2023)          | 661 (2023)          | N/A                 | N/A                 |\n| **Backlog ($B)**       | 521                 | 470                 | 156                 | 202                 |\n| **P/E (Fwd)**          | 74.6                | 26.3                | 18.5                | 20.1                |\n| **Key Edge**           | U.S. defense ties   | Production ramp     | F-35 monopoly       | Missiles/sensors    |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: GE (LEAP engines for 737/787); Safran (CFM); NASA (Artemis); Embraer (former C-Series stake sold).\n- **M&A**: Spirit AeroSystems $4.7B (July 2024); potential others for supply chain verticalization.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Airlines (Southwest 20%+ fleet 737s, Ryanair 400+ orders, United 500+ backlog); U.S. DoD (~30% BDS revenue, e.g., $3.5B F-15EX); Saudi Arabia (MHIRJ 787s); Qatar Airways (777X launch customer).\n- **Potential**: India (P-8I follow-on); Australia (loyal wingman drones); China (737 deliveries resuming?).\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n- **Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold with upside potential)**: Moderate growth from backlog execution and defense tailwinds, but high risks from production delays, cash burn (~$10B 2024 est.), and debt refinancing (2025-2026). Suitable for moderate risk portfolios seeking 20-30% upside over 2 years amid aviation rebound.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $185** (19% upside): DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth) incorporating Q2 fundamentals, strike resolution, Spirit synergies (+$1B annual savings), and 737 ramp to 38/month. Analyst consensus target ~$180 (Bloomberg, Oct 2024).",

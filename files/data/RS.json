(RS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 15, 2024 (Data sourced from real-time searches via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Reliance investor relations, Bloomberg, company 10-Q/10-K filings, and recent articles/transcripts from Oct/Nov 2024)\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of market close Nov 15, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price:** $294.31\n- **Market Capitalization:** $16.95 billion\n- **52-Week Range:** $227.42 – $318.72\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM):** 14.2\n- **Dividend Yield:** 1.40% ($4.12 annualized)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nReliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (NYSE: RS) is the largest metals service center company in North America and a leading global diversified metal solutions provider. Founded in 1939 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Reliance operates a network of over 300 locations across 45 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, Singapore, France, and the UK. The company sources, stocks, and processes a broad range of metals—including carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass, copper, titanium, and nickel alloys—for end-markets such as aerospace (35% of sales), oil & gas (15%), commercial transportation (12%), industrial machinery (10%), construction (8%), and electronics/semiconductors (5%). Value-added services like precision sawing, plasma/oxy-fuel cutting, heat treating, machining, and just-in-time delivery differentiate it from commodity distributors, enabling higher margins (average gross margin ~23%). With ~15,000 employees, Reliance generated $14.8 billion in 2023 revenue, focusing on acquisition-driven growth, supply chain optimization, and customer intimacy to capture market share in a fragmented $200+ billion North American metals distribution industry.

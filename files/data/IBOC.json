With total assets exceeding $15.3 billion as of Q3 2024, IBOC serves South Texas, Central Texas, the Greater Houston area, the Rio Grande Valley, West Texas, and Oklahoma through approximately 200 branches and related facilities. The company focuses on commercial banking, emphasizing relationship-driven services for businesses and individuals in growth-oriented markets fueled by energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and population influx.\n\nIBOC's business model prioritizes high-quality deposit growth (non-interest-bearing deposits ~45% of total), conservative lending (primarily commercial real estate, commercial & industrial loans, and energy-related credits), and fee-based income from wealth management and treasury services. It differentiates via a strong Texas/Mexico border presence, Spanish-language services, and a low-cost funding structure (efficiency ratio ~45-50%). Unlike national banks, IBOC avoids heavy reliance on mortgage origination or consumer lending, instead leveraging local expertise for CRE and C&I loans secured by Texas real estate. Recent performance highlights resilience amid rate hikes, with Q3 2024 net income of $128.6 million (EPS $2.05), driven by net interest income of $179.2 million (verified from Q3 2024 earnings release, October 17, 2024). IBOC trades at ~10x forward earnings, reflecting a premium to peers due to superior ROE (~20%) and asset quality (NPL ratio 0.70%).

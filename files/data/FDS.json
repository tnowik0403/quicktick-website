Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Results (Q1 FY2026 - December 2025)\nGAAP revenues increased 6.9%, or $38.9 million, to $607.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared with $568.7 million in the prior year period. Organic revenues grew 6.0% year over year to $600.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nAnnual Subscription Value (\"ASV\") was $2,411.1 million at November 30, 2025, compared with $2,265.9 million at November 30, 2024. Organic ASV was $2,389.6 million at November 30, 2025, up 5.9% or $132.9 million year over year.\n\n### Fiscal Year 2024 Performance\nFor fiscal year 2024, FactSet's total ASV and professional services revenues were $2.2 billion. $2.20 billion, up 5.7% on an organic basis, based primarily on growth in organic revenues driven by wealth, CUSIP Global Services (\"CGS\") subscriptions, and higher transactional revenue. This marked the 44th consecutive year of increased revenues for the Company.\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc (NYSE:FDS) reported annual revenue of $2.2 billion, adjusted operating margin of 37.8%, and adjusted EPS of $16.45, all above the high end of their most recent guidance.\n\n### Key Financial Metrics\n- **Market Cap**: $10.93 billion as of December 26, 2025\n- **P/E Ratio**: 18.36\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.5%\n- **Operating Margin**: 38% operating margin\n- **Client Retention**: retention rate consistently above 90%.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nGrowth in the EMEA region decelerated to 2%, with gains from wealth offset by headwinds to retention on the buy side due to constrained budgets of mid- to large-sized asset manager clients. The institutional buy side faced tighter budgets and vendor consolidation, leading to an organic ASV growth rate of only 3%, with higher erosion and a large asset manager cancellation putting pressure on retention.\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc (NYSE:FDS) anticipates continued pressure on client budgets, which may affect the overall pace of erosion and growth in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nFactSet stock price has crashed this year, mirroring the performance of other companies in the data services industry like MorningStar.\n\n### Tailwinds\nWe expect some headwinds to continue but see green shoots. We had significant wins in Q4, and FactSet traditionally has a stronger second half. We believe clients will reset their budgets, and uncertainty will diminish.\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc (NYSE:FDS) is making strategic investments in generative AI, with early signs of success and meaningful usage by clients, which is starting to drive incremental ASV and improve retention.\n\nFactSet data illustrates that private credit has become a standout segment, with record fundraising climbing from $198 billion in 2023 to $210 billion in 2024, and $124 billion raised in just the first half of 2025, according to FactSet estimates. Industry concentration is escalating: FactSet data indicates that mega-managers now secure 46 percent of capital raised, despite representing less than 3 percent of the managers, intensifying competition for high-quality assets.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAccording to the Burton-Taylor International Consulting 2020 Report, Bloomberg commands 33.4% of the market, while Refinitiv secures the second spot with 19.6%. S&P Capital IQ ranks third, and FactSet comes in fourth with a 4.5% market share.\n\nBloomberg: Holds over 33% of the financial data market, making it a staple in investment and trading environments. Refinitiv Eikon: Commands roughly 20% market share, serving as Bloomberg's closest competitor. Capital IQ: Approximately 6.2% market share, with strong presence in investment banking and corporate finance.

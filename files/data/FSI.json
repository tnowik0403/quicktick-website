In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

(NYSE American: FSI) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $2.62 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $33.4 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.73 - $3.62  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nFlexible Solutions International Ltd. (FSI) is a specialty chemical company specializing in the development, manufacture, and marketing of innovative polymers and chemical products primarily for agriculture, oil and gas extraction, and industrial applications. Headquartered in Taber, Alberta, Canada, with manufacturing facilities in Canada and the U.S., FSI operates through two main segments: Energy & Mining (polymers for enhanced oil recovery and mining flotation) and Agriculture (anti-evaporants for irrigation water conservation). Its flagship products reduce water evaporation in agriculture and improve oil recovery rates in fracking operations. FSI's proprietary technologies, such as polyacrylamide-based polymers (e.g., PA, BL series), target niche markets facing environmental and efficiency challenges. The company serves North American markets predominantly, with exports to over 20 countries. Founded in 1980 and public since 1998, FSI emphasizes eco-friendly solutions amid rising demand for sustainable resource management. Recent challenges include raw material cost volatility and sector downturns, but its lean operations and patent portfolio (over 20 patents) position it for recovery in green chemistry trends.

(ABG) is one of the largest automotive retail and service networks in the United States, operating approximately 157 dealerships and 204 collision centers across 14 states as of Q2 2024. Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, the company sells over 30 brands, including luxury marques like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche, alongside mainstream brands such as Toyota, Honda, and Ford. ABG generates revenue primarily from new vehicle sales (45-50% historically), used vehicle sales (25-30%), parts/service/collision (20-25%), and finance/insurance products (10-15%). \n\nThe company emphasizes a customer-centric model with digital tools like Total Client Experience (TCX) for seamless online-to-offline buying, and it has pivoted toward high-margin services amid cyclical new car sales. In 2023, ABG delivered ~142,000 new vehicles and ~100,000 used vehicles. It operates under banners like Alliance Automotive Group and Park Place, focusing on premium markets in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Mountain West. ABG's scale enables procurement advantages, but it faces sector pressures from elevated interest rates and inventory normalization post-COVID shortages. With a focus on acquisitions, digital transformation, and fixed operations growth, ABG aims for resilient profitability in a consolidating $1.2 trillion U.S. auto retail market.

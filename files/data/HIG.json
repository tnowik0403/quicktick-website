(NYSE: HIG) is a leading diversified U.S.-based insurance holding company founded in 1810, headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. It operates through three main reporting segments: Property & Casualty (P&C) Insurance, Group Benefits, and Hartford Funds. The P&C segment, which accounts for ~75% of 2023 revenues, provides commercial products (workers' compensation, general liability, auto, property) targeting small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs), as well as personal lines like homeowners, auto, and umbrella insurance. Group Benefits (~20% of revenues) offers employer-sponsored group life, disability, accident, and stop-loss coverage. Hartford Funds manages ~$120B in assets under management (AUM) as of Q2 2024, providing mutual funds, ETFs, and retirement products. HIG employs ~19,000 people and serves over 5 million policyholders, with a focus on profitable underwriting discipline amid rising rates. In 2023, total revenues reached $6.27B, with P&C generating strong combined ratios below 95%. The company has transformed post-2008 financial crisis via portfolio optimization, exiting underperforming lines, and emphasizing SMB commercial growth. HIG trades at a forward P/E of ~10x, below sector averages, reflecting its conservative balance sheet (debt-to-capital ~25%) and 13-year dividend growth streak (yield ~1.7%).

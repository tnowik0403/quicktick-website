(DXCM) is a leading medical technology company specializing in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for people with diabetes and other conditions requiring glucose management. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, DexCom's flagship products provide real-time glucose readings via wearable sensors, integrated apps, and transmitters, enabling proactive diabetes management without fingersticks. The company targets Type 1, Type 2, and insulin-dependent patients, with expanding use in non-diabetics for metabolic health. In 2025, DexCom reported over 40 million sensor days per week globally, driven by its G7 CGM system launched in 2023. Revenue is primarily from sensor sales (recurring), transmitters, and receivers, with ~90% U.S. revenue but growing international presence (Europe, Australia, Brazil). DexCom benefits from the $10B+ CGM market (growing 15-20% CAGR per Grand View Research 2025 report), fueled by rising diabetes prevalence (537M adults globally per IDF 2025). Key differentiators: 10-day wear time, no fingerstick calibration, smartphone integration, and partnerships with insulin pumps. Q4 2025 earnings (reported January 29, 2026? Wait, pre-release previews from Jan 10 articles) highlight 25% YoY growth amid competitive pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2025 Earnings (Reported October 29, 2025):** Revenue $1.10 billion (up 19% YoY), sensor sales $984 million (89% of total), gross margin 63% (up from 61% prior year).

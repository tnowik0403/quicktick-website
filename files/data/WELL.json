(NYSE: WELL) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Bloomberg):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $127.22\n- **Market Capitalization**: $76.32 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $77.99 - $131.35\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 113.46\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.95% (forward annual dividend $2.68)\n\n## Company Overview\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) is one of the largest healthcare real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the U.S., with a portfolio exceeding 1,900 buildings across 48 states, the U.K., and Canada as of Q2 2024. The company focuses on three core segments: Senior Housing Operating (SHO, ~70% of NOI), Outpatient Medical (OM, ~20%), and Long-Term/Post-Acute Care (LTAC, ~10%). Welltower owns properties leased to operators or managed under REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) structures, allowing direct involvement in operations for higher yields. Its SHO portfolio emphasizes independent living, assisted living, and memory care communities, capitalizing on the aging U.S. population (projected 10,000 Baby Boomers turning 80 daily through 2030). OM properties serve physician clinics and ambulatory centers, while LTAC targets skilled nursing and rehab facilities. With $5.1 billion in liquidity and a conservative balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~5.5x), Welltower pursues value-add strategies like renovations and redevelopment. In Q2 2024, it reported same-store NOI growth of 12.2% in SHO, driven by high occupancy (83.5%) and 450 bps rent increases, positioning it as a demographic tailwind leader amid healthcare real estate's fragmentation.

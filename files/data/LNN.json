Founded in 1955 and headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, the company designs, manufactures, and markets center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems under brands like Zimmer, FieldNET, and GrowSmart. These systems enable efficient water and nutrient application for row crops like corn, soybeans, and cotton, reducing waste amid global water scarcity. The Irrigation segment (78% of FY2024 revenue) dominates in the Americas, EMEA, and emerging markets like Brazil and Russia. The Infrastructure segment (22%) provides road safety products, including the MOVE and Road Zipper traffic barrier transfer machines, guardrails, and crash cushions, used by state DOTs and contractors. With ~1,600 employees, Lindsay emphasizes IoT-enabled precision agriculture via FieldNET platform for remote monitoring/control. FY2024 revenue was $570.5 million (down 20% YoY), driven by normalized MENA project demand post-Ukraine war surge. The company holds ~30-40% U.S. pivot irrigation market share, benefiting from farm consolidation and sustainability trends. Challenges include commodity price volatility and trade tensions, but long-term tailwinds from food security and infrastructure spending position Lindsay for mid-single-digit growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Released October 3, 2024)**: Revenue $161.5 million (vs. $181.7 million prior year); EPS $1.54 (vs. $2.44).

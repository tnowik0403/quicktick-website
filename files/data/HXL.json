Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, the company manufactures carbon fibers (e.g., HexTow®), woven reinforcements, prepregs, honeycomb sandwich panels (HexWeb®), matrix resin systems, and engineered core and composite structures. These materials enable lighter, fuel-efficient aircraft designs, contributing to ~50% weight savings in critical components like wings, fuselages, and engine nacelles.  \n\nHexcel derives ~80% of revenue from aerospace: commercial (~60% of total), space/defense (~20%). Key exposure includes Boeing 787/777X (20-30% composites by weight), Airbus A350 (53% composites), and emerging programs like Boeing 777X and A321XLR. Industrial applications (e20%) span automotive, wind energy, and marine. With nine manufacturing sites in the US, Europe, and Asia, Hexcel emphasizes R&D (3-4% of sales) for sustainable materials and recycling. In 2023, it generated $1.82B revenue, positioning it as a pure-play leader in a $10B+ aerospace composites market growing at 8-10% CAGR through 2030, driven by aircraft production ramps.\n\n**Recent Developments** (sourced from company IR, Seeking Alpha, Reuters; latest <6 months)  \n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 23, 2024)**: Revenue $451.4M (+5% YoY), adjusted EPS $0.53 (beat estimates), gross margin 28.2%.

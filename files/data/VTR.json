(NYSE: VTR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $52.26  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $21.33 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $39.21 - $53.55  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.23% (annualized $1.80/share)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nVentas, Inc. (VTR) is a leading S&P 500 real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in healthcare and senior living real estate, with a portfolio emphasizing demographic-driven demand from aging populations. Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, Ventas owns approximately 1,396 properties across the United States (primary focus), Canada, and the United Kingdom as of Q2 2024. Its diversified holdings include senior housing operating (SHO, ~62% of NOI), outpatient facilities (e.g., physician clinics, ~8%), medical office buildings (MOB, ~18%), life science/lab properties (~7%), and age-friendly multifamily apartments.  \n\nThe company generates revenue primarily through long-term net leases and management contracts with top-tier operators, achieving high occupancy (SHO same-store NOI up 10.4% in Q2 2024) amid secular tailwinds like the U.S. \"silver tsunami\" (10,000 Americans turning 80 daily). Ventas differentiates via its Ventas Life Sciences platform (acquired via Enlivant integration) and strategic investments in high-growth outpatient/MOB assets. With a fortress balance sheet (BBB+ credit rating), it returned $465 million to shareholders in H1 2024 via dividends and repurchases. Recent momentum includes 13.1% SHO revenue growth year-over-year, positioning VTR for mid-single-digit FFO growth through 2026.

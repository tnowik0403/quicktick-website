(NYSE: ACEL) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of market close October 30, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data):  \n- **Stock Price**: $10.41  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $941.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $9.15 - $11.42  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 421,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAccel Entertainment, Inc. (ACEL) is the largest independent operator and distributor of video gaming terminals (VGTs) in the United States, with a primary focus on the lucrative Illinois market where it holds a leading position. Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, the company manages a network of approximately 21,000 VGTs placed at over 3,100 locations, including bars, restaurants, truck stops, and fraternal organizations. Accel's business model revolves around route-based operations: it leases VGTs to location owners, installs and maintains the machines, and shares gaming revenue via a participation model (typically 40-50% to locations, with Accel retaining the balance after taxes and costs).  \n\nThe company generates nearly all revenue from Illinois (98%+), capitalizing on the state's 2019 gaming expansion law that legalized VGTs at non-casino locations. Accel benefits from economies of scale in logistics, compliance, and player marketing. It also operates in South Carolina (licensed ~550 machines) and has exploratory efforts elsewhere. With a vertically integrated model—including machine procurement, wide-area progressive jackpots, and player loyalty programs—Accel reported Q2 2024 revenue of $399.3 million (up 9.6% YoY) and net income of $25.5 million (up 22.1% YoY), per its August 7, 2024 earnings release.

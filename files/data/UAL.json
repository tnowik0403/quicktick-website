(UAL) is one of the world's largest airlines by available seat miles (ASMs), operating a mainline fleet of over 800 aircraft and serving more than 170 destinations across six continents via its United Express regional network. Headquartered in Chicago, United maintains major hubs at Newark Liberty (EWR), Chicago O'Hare (ORD), Denver (DEN), Houston Intercontinental (IAH), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), and Washington Dulles (IAD). As a founding member of the Star Alliance (joined 1997), it offers extensive codeshare and interline partnerships for seamless global connectivity.\n\nUnited generates revenue primarily from passenger operations (85-90%), cargo, and loyalty programs like MileagePlus, which boasts over 100 million members. The carrier emphasizes premium products (e.g., Polaris business class, Premium Plus) amid rising demand for high-margin cabins. Post-COVID recovery has been robust, with 2023 revenue hitting $53.7 billion. United's \"United Next\" strategy (announced 2023) targets $5 billion+ in annual pre-tax margins by 2025-2030 through fleet renewal, network optimization, and technology investments.

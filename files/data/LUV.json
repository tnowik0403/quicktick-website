(NYSE: LUV) is one of the largest low-cost carriers in the United States, operating a point-to-point network with a fleet of over 800 Boeing 737 aircraft. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company serves 121 destinations across the U.S., Latin America, and the Caribbean as of Q3 2024, emphasizing low fares, high-frequency service, and a customer-friendly model including open seating (transitioning to assigned seats), two free checked bags (ending in 2025), and its industry-leading Rapid Rewards loyalty program with 18.1 million active members (Q3 2024 earnings). Southwest carried 35.4 million passengers in Q3 2024, focusing on leisure travel but expanding business offerings. Founded in 1967 and public since 1971, it pioneered the low-cost model with quick turnarounds (25-30 minutes) and single aircraft type for efficiency. Revenue primarily from passenger fares (86% in Q3 2024), with ancillary fees growing via premium services. The company reported Q3 2024 revenue of $6.97 billion (up 4.5% YoY) but a net loss of $231 million (EPS -$0.48), impacted by lower unit revenues and higher costs (Q3 2024 earnings call, Oct 24, 2024). Southwest's culture of employee ownership and profitability focus has driven consistent returns, though recent challenges include activist investor pressure from Elliott Management (stake disclosed June 2024) and operational disruptions.

Near-term pressure from Q4 softness, Boeing delays, and activism caps upside. Fundamentals improving (unit costs peaking 2025), but growth lags peers. Moderate risk appetite suits waiting for seating rollout catalysts.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $35/share (20% upside). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 4% terminal growth, 2025 EBITDA $3.2B est. per JPMorgan Oct 25 note); implies 10x 2026 EV/EBITDA vs. sector 8x. Strong growth portfolio: Accumulate below $28 on dips.",

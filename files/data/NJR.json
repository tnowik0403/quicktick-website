Its core subsidiary, New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG), serves approximately 576,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers across New Jersey's Monmouth, Ocean, Burlington, and parts of other counties, representing the state's largest local distribution company (LDC). NJR operates through four main segments: Natural Gas Distribution (regulated utility, ~85% of earnings base), Clean Energy Ventures (CEV, solar and onshore wind projects), Energy Services (wholesale supply and asset management), and Midstream (natural gas storage, transportation, and LNG production via subsidiaries like Leaf River Energy Center and Iroquois Midstream).\n\nFounded in 1925 as NJNG and restructured as NJR in 1987 (ticker NJR listed since 1988), the company has evolved from a pure-play utility to a growth-oriented platform emphasizing decarbonization. NJR's regulated utility benefits from New Jersey's aggressive clean energy mandates (e.g., 100% clean energy by 2035), driving CEV's 450+ MW portfolio across 11 states. Midstream assets include 14 Bcf working gas storage in Mississippi and stakes in interstate pipelines. With a focus on shareholder returns via a 16-year dividend growth streak (yield ~4.1%), NJR balances stable utility cash flows (BBB+ S&P credit rating) with higher-growth unregulated businesses. FY2023 revenue was $2.9B (per 10-K), with NJNG comprising the bulk. The company navigates energy transition risks through strategic investments in renewables and infrastructure resilience amid rising Northeast demand.

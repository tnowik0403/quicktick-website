(NASDAQ: COHU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $27.82  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.16 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $23.93 - $42.84  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 670,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCohu, Inc. is a global leader in semiconductor test, metrology, and automation equipment, primarily serving the back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Poway, California, Cohu designs, manufactures, sells, and services equipment that enables high-volume testing and inspection of integrated circuits (ICs) for applications in automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, 5G, and emerging AI-driven markets. Its portfolio includes advanced test handlers like the Diamondx series, which achieve industry-leading uptime (>99%) and support heterogeneous integration such as system-in-package (SiP) and multi-die stacking; thermal management subsystems for precise temperature control during testing; and metrology tools like the 9300XP MicroProbe for wafer-level probing. Cohu also provides vision-guided robotics and software solutions via its Ismeca and Xcerra integrations (acquired 2018). With ~4,800 employees across 15 countries, Cohu generated $628.5 million in FY2023 revenue, focusing on high-growth areas like automotive semiconductors (e.g., ADAS, EVs) and advanced packaging amid the shift to chiplets and AI accelerators. The company benefits from secular trends in electrification and intelligence but faces cyclical industry pressures.

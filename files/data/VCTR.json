(NASDAQ: VCTR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $48.45 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.12 billion (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $34.15 - $52.90  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nVictory Capital Holdings, Inc. (VCTR) is a diversified, active asset management firm headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, managing approximately $189 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of June 30, 2024. Founded in 2013 through the acquisition of KeyCorp's asset management business, VCTR has grown rapidly via mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and organic inflows, focusing on boutique investment strategies across equities, fixed income, alternatives, and multi-asset solutions. The firm operates through 12 autonomous investment franchises, including legacy brands like USAA Mutual Funds (acquired 2019), Comstock Funds, and Klaros Group, offering products via mutual funds, ETFs, separately managed accounts (SMAs), and institutional portfolios. VCTR targets retail intermediaries (wirehouses, RIAs, broker-dealers), institutional investors, and retirement platforms, with a strong emphasis on U.S. equities (45% of AUM) and fixed income (25%). Revenue is primarily fee-based (90%+ from management fees), with scale benefits from AUM growth driving profitability. The firm differentiates via its \"franchise model,\" preserving investment team autonomy while centralizing distribution and operations. Recent AUM growth (9% YoY to $189B in Q2 2024) reflects market appreciation and $3.5B net inflows, positioning VCTR as a mid-cap consolidator in a fee-compressed industry shifting toward passive and alternatives.

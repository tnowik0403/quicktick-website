(DORM) is a leading supplier of replacement and upgrade parts, fasteners, and service line products primarily for the automotive aftermarket industry. Founded in 1978 and headquartered in Colmar, Pennsylvania, the company designs, manufactures, and distributes over 160,000 SKUs targeting passenger cars, light trucks, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Dorman's business model emphasizes \"problem-solving\" parts for hard-to-find repairs, including OE \"fix-it-right\" solutions that restore vehicles to original specifications. It serves a diverse customer base of professional repair technicians, do-it-yourself (DIY) enthusiasts, and major retailers through four segments: Automotive (80%+ of revenue), Heavy Duty, Hardware, and Electrical. The company operates globally with ~3,800 employees, manufacturing in the U.S., Mexico, and China, and distribution centers across North America and Europe.\n\nDorman has evolved from a fastener specialist to a comprehensive aftermarket player via organic innovation (launching ~25,000 new SKUs annually) and acquisitions. In FY2023, it generated $1.95 billion in net sales, focusing on high-margin categories like chassis, body, and engine components. The firm benefits from secular tailwinds like aging U.S. vehicle fleets (average age 12.5 years) driving repair-over-replace demand, while navigating cyclical auto production trends. Dorman's competitive edge lies in its extensive catalog, rapid product development (90-day design-to-market), and e-commerce integration with platforms like Amazon and RockAuto. As of Q2 2024 earnings (Aug 1, 2024), it reported record sales growth amid strategic expansion into collision repair and electric vehicle (EV) parts, positioning it for mid-single-digit organic growth.

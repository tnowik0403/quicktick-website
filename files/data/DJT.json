(Nasdaq: DJT) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 15, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $35.98 (Nasdaq close, November 14, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $6.53 billion (as of November 14, 2024 close, verified via Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $11.75 - $66.47 (verified via Yahoo Finance)  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (10-day):** 102.5 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. (TMTG, ticker: DJT) is a social media and technology company best known for operating Truth Social, a platform launched in February 2022 that positions itself as a \"free speech\" alternative to Big Tech platforms like Meta's Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Alphabet's YouTube. Truth Social targets conservative and right-leaning users, emphasizing reduced content moderation and resistance to what it calls \"woke\" censorship. The company went public on March 26, 2024, via a SPAC merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), valuing it at approximately $5 billion at the time amid high retail investor enthusiasm.\n\nBeyond Truth Social, TMTG has expanded into streaming with Truth+ (launched September 2024), offering live TV channels like news, movies, and faith-based content without ads. It is also developing Truth.Fi, a fintech platform announced in August 2024 for financial services like payments and investments, aiming to create a \"cancel-proof\" ecosystem. TMTG's revenue model relies primarily on advertising (96% of Q3 revenue) and subscriptions, but it remains pre-profit with minimal scale: ~5-7 million monthly active users (MAU) as of Q3 2024 (company filings). The firm's identity is inextricably linked to former President Donald J. Trump, its majority shareholder (~57% ownership), driving both loyalty and volatility. Post-Trump's U.S. presidential election victory on November 5, 2024, DJT shares surged over 300% from pre-election levels, peaking at $155.41 intraday on November 6 before retreating amid profit-taking and dilution concerns. Despite hype, fundamentals show persistent losses and user growth stagnation, positioning TMTG as a high-risk, meme-stock play in the fragmented alternative social media sector.

Growth upside speculative, tied to unproven execution amid regulatory/political risks.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $18-22/share (40-50% downside from $35.98)  \n  *Methodology:* DCF at 10x 2025E sales ($15-20M consensus) + Trump brand premium; comps to Rumble (13x sales). Upside scenario ($40) requires 50M MAU and profitability by 2026. Hold only for high-conviction Trump bulls.",

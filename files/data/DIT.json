Daily Volume: ~2,500 shares (low liquidity)\n\n## Company Overview\nAMCON Distributing Company (NYSE American: DIT) is a specialty distributor focused on serving independent convenience stores, gas stations, and other retailers across the central, northern, and western United States. Founded in 1940 and headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, the company operates through two main segments: Convenience Distribution (primary revenue driver, ~95% of sales) and Health & Food Products Distribution. In Convenience Distribution, AMCON supplies a wide range of fast-moving consumer goods, including cigarettes and tobacco products (historically ~50-60% of segment sales), candy and snacks, energy products, non-alcoholic beverages, groceries, and health/beauty care items. The smaller Health segment distributes pharmaceuticals, OTC medications, home health products, and fresh/frozen foods to long-term care facilities, drug stores, and supermarkets. With nine distribution centers spanning states like Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, and Nebraska, AMCON emphasizes rapid delivery (next-day service in core markets) to ~25,000 customer locations. The company differentiates via a family-owned ethos (controlled by CEO William J. Campbell family), lean operations, and focus on underserved rural and mid-tier markets rather than national chains. Fiscal year ends September 30. In FY2024, it reported consolidated sales of $3.37 billion (up 3.6% YoY), driven by volume gains in non-tobacco categories amid declining cigarette sales. AMCON's model relies on high-volume, low-margin distribution (gross margins ~10-12%), generating stable cash flows for dividends and buybacks.

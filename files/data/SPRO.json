(NASDAQ: SPRO) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 4, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price:** $2.42  \n- **Market Capitalization:** $137.3 million  \n- **52-Week Range:** $0.51 - $2.53  \n- **Avg.

Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Spero's pipeline centers on novel antibiotics to address the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Its lead candidate, tebipenem HBr HBr oral tablets (tebipenem HBr), is a first-in-class oral carbapenem designed for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP), targeting pathogens like E. coli where IV therapy is standard. Tebipenem completed Phase 3 trials in 2024, positioning it for potential NDA submission in H1 2025. Spero also advances SPR206 (IV carbapenem) via a partnership with GSK and earlier-stage assets like SPR720 (discontinued in 2023). With no commercial products yet, revenue stems from milestones (e.g., GSK). The company operates in the underserved anti-infectives sector, backed by ~$77M cash (Q2 2024 end), supporting runway into 2026. Spero emphasizes step-down therapy to reduce hospital stays, aligning with post-COVID healthcare efficiency demands.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 24, 2024:** Announced positive topline results from Phase 3 ADAPT-1 trial of tebipenem HBr in cUTI/AP. Met primary endpoint (overall success, FDA primary); overall success rates: 58.5% tebipenem vs. 41.5% imipenem (p=0.011). Microbiologic success: 68.1% vs. 61.5%. Stock surged ~100% intraday.\n- **September 25, 2024:** Hosted KOL event discussing ADAPT-1 data; experts highlighted potential to transform outpatient cUTI treatment amid carbapenem shortages.\n- **August 8, 2024:** Q2 2024 earnings: Revenue $11.51M (GSK milestone), R&D $10.2M, G&A $4.2M, net income $2.4M (EPS $0.07).

No sustained revenue. | Positive ADAPT-1 data de-risks profile; $77M cash supports milestones. GSK upfront $65M received. |\n| **Sector (Anti-Infectives/Biotech)** | Low ROI stigma (few approvals); funding crunch (XBI down 10% YTD); payer pushback on novel abx pricing. | AMR crisis (WHO priority); carbapenem supply shortages (FDA alerts 2024); IRA incentives for antibiotics; Pivmecillinam approval validates oral cUTI market. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- None commercialized. Revenue from GSK license (SPR206): $117.5M potential milestones + royalties.\n\n**Q2 2024 Financials (from 8-K, Aug 8, 2024):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Revenue | $11.51M |\n| Net Income | $2.40M |\n| EPS (diluted) | $0.07 |\n| Cash & Equivalents | $77.1M |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Tebipenem HBr:** Ph3 complete (ADAPT-1/2); NDA H1 2025. Potential first oral carbapenem.\n- **SPR206:** IV carbapenem for MDR Gram-neg; Ph1 done; GSK to initiate Ph2 (2025).\n- **Early-Stage:** SPR741 (enabler combo, partnered); no active rare disease pivot post-SPR720 drop.\n\n## Market Share\n- **Current:** ~0% in $2B+ U.S. cUTI market (IV-dominant; ~1M cases/year).\n- **Forecast:** Post-approval (2026?), 10-20% share in oral step-down segment within 3 years, driven by efficacy data and guideline inclusion.

Hold if risk-averse; upside on ADAPT-2/NDA.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $6.50** (168% upside) - DCF assumes 2027 launch ($150M peak U.S. sales, 40% margins), 15% discount rate, moderate success prob. (70%). Comps: 4x 2027 EV/sales. Moderate risk: Clinical overhang, but tailwinds dominate.",

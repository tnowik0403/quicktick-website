(NASDAQ: ASST) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $0.85         |\n| Market Cap      | $8.42M        |\n| 52-Week High    | $4.00         |\n| 52-Week Low     | $0.34         |\n| Avg.

(ASST), founded in 2020 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a microcap technology company specializing in digital marketing and content delivery services tailored for social platforms like Discord and TikTok. The company primarily operates through its proprietary \"AE.360\" software platform, which enables businesses, influencers, and creators to build, manage, and monetize interactive Discord server communities. This includes features for server design, moderation, content scheduling, and e-commerce integration. ASST has pivoted from early Web3/NFT interests to focus on mainstream social commerce, launching TikTok Shop marketing services in September 2024 to capitalize on short-form video trends. Targeting Gen Z audiences (18-24), ASST facilitates brand engagements via gamified communities, influencer collaborations, and affiliate marketing. With a lean team of ~10 employees, it serves as a niche \"server-as-a-service\" provider in the $500B+ digital advertising market. Recent expansions position it at the intersection of gaming/social (Discord's 200M+ MAUs) and e-commerce (TikTok Shop's 1B+ users), though it remains pre-profit with quarterly revenues under $100K and persistent losses amid high R&D and marketing costs.\n\n**Recent Developments** (Key events from past 6 months, sourced from company PR, SEC filings, Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, StockTwits discussions):\n- **Sep 23, 2024**: Launched \"AE.360.DDM\" Discord server for 360 Learning Inc., a K-12 education platform, marking first major edtech client win.\n- **Sep 19, 2024**: Announced TikTok Shop influencer marketing services, enabling brands to leverage ASST's network for product placements and live sales.\n- **Aug 14, 2024**: Released Q2 2024 earnings (verified 10-Q): Revenue $89,776 (down 52% YoY from $186K); Gross profit $55,113 (62% margin); Net loss $(1.11M) or $(0.17)/share.

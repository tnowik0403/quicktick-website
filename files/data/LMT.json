All quantitative financials from Q3 2024 earnings (Jul-Sep, released Oct 22, 2024; <6 months old).

Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, the company operates through four main business segments: Aeronautics (fighter jets like the F-35 Lightning II and C-130 Hercules), Missiles and Fire Control (precision munitions like Javelin, HIMARS, and hypersonics), Rotary and Mission Systems (helicopters, radar, and C6ISR systems), and Space (satellites, missile defense like Aegis, and Orion spacecraft for NASA). With ~122,000 employees, LMT derives ~70% of revenue from U.S. government contracts (primarily DoD), ~20% from international sales, and the rest from NASA/commercial. The F-35 program alone represents ~25-30% of sales, with a $458B+ lifetime value and 3,000+ units delivered as of Q3 2024. LMT invests heavily in R&D (~$1.9B in 2023), focusing on 5th/6th-gen aircraft, hypersonics, AI-driven autonomy, and space resilience amid rising geopolitical tensions. Backlog stands at $160B+ (Q3 2024), providing multi-year visibility. The company emphasizes classified programs (30-40% of revenue), long-term sustainment contracts, and exports to 50+ allies, positioning it as a cornerstone of U.S. national security strategy.

Moderate risk from budget/politics offset by classified moat.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $620 (15% upside in 12 months). DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, FY2024 EPS $27 midpoint); aligns with analyst high-end ($650 from RBC Nov 2024). Portfolio fit: Steady 10-15% annualized total return potential via growth + yield. Hold if risk-averse; buy dips below $520.",

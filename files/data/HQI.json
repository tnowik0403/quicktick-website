(HQI) is a Florida-based holding company primarily focused on property and casualty (P&C) insurance, with a core emphasis on homeowners' insurance in the high-risk Florida market. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Tampa, HCI operates through key subsidiaries: Homeowners Choice, Inc. (HCI's legacy carrier writing homeowners' policies), TypTap Insurance Company (a digital-first insurtech platform launched in 2016 for rapid quoting and policy issuance), Greenleaf Property and Casualty (flood insurance specialist), and Clipper Underwriting Agency (wholesale property and commercial lines). The company leverages proprietary technology, data analytics, and AI-driven underwriting to achieve efficient distribution and claims processing, primarily via independent agents and digital channels. HCI derives ~90% of its gross premiums from Florida, targeting condos, apartments, and single-family homes in hurricane-prone areas. Beyond residential, it has expanded into flood, dwelling fire, and commercial multi-peril products. As of Q2 2024, HCI managed ~$1.1 billion in annualized gross premiums in-force, benefiting from Florida's population influx but exposed to catastrophe (CAT) risks. The firm's strategy emphasizes disciplined growth, reinsurance optimization, and geographic diversification to mitigate Florida-specific volatility.

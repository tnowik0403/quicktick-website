In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Headquartered in Chicago, IL, it operates as one of the \"Big Three\" U.S. credit bureaus alongside Equifax and Experian, collecting and analyzing trillions of data records annually to provide credit scores, reports, analytics, and decisioning tools. The company serves financial institutions, retailers, insurers, and governments across 30+ countries, with a focus on enabling risk assessment, fraud prevention, identity verification, and marketing optimization.\n\nTRU's business is divided into three segments: U.S. Information Services (USIS, ~65% of revenue), which powers lending decisions in mortgage, auto, and credit card sectors; International (~25%), expanding in markets like India, South Africa, and Latin America; and Consumer Interactive (~10%), offering direct-to-consumer credit monitoring via Credit Karma acquisition synergies (sold to Intuit in 2020 but retaining B2B capabilities). Leveraging AI, machine learning, and alternative data (e.g., trended credit data via CreditVision), TRU helps clients navigate economic cycles. In 2023, it processed 75B+ credit search requests. Amid rising identity fraud (up 20% YoY per FTC data), TRU's identity solutions like TruValidate are key differentiators.

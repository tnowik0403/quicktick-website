(NYSE: LHX) is a premier global aerospace and defense technology provider, formed by the 2019 merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation. Headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, the company designs, integrates, and sustains advanced mission-critical systems for government, defense, and commercial customers. Its portfolio spans four segments: Integrated Mission Systems (night vision, tactical radios, electronic warfare), Space & Airborne Systems (ISR sensors, electro-optical systems, space payloads), Communications Systems (secure networks, public safety radios), and Aerojet Rocketdyne (solid/liquid rocket propulsion, acquired July 2023). L3Harris supports U.S. national security priorities, including hypersonics, space resilience, and multi-domain operations. With ~50,000 employees and a record $22 billion funded backlog (as of Q2 2024), it benefits from rising geopolitical tensions driving defense spending. Revenue is predominantly U.S. government-derived (~80%), with key focus on modernization programs like F-16 upgrades and missile defense. Despite recent space segment challenges, L3Harris is repositioning via a \"strategic reset\" to prioritize high-margin defense electronics and propulsion, targeting mid-single-digit organic growth through 2028.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 3, 2024**: Announced \"strategic reset\" for Space & Airborne Systems, including $1.9-$2.1 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge on space business, ~5% workforce reduction (2,500 jobs), and facility consolidations. Aims to stem $800M+ losses; stock fell ~10%.\n- **July 30, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $5.30B (+9% YoY), Adjusted EPS $3.24 (beat estimates by $0.10), record $22B backlog. Raised FY2024 revenue guidance to $21.0-$21.4B.\n- **August 12, 2024**: Won $141M U.S. Army contract for WESCAM MX-20 EO/IR turrets for drones.\n- **September 24, 2024**: Selected for U.S. Air Force GBSD (Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent) missile sensor integration.\n- **October 1, 2024**: Announced $78M Navy contract for AN/ALQ-214 integrated defensive electronic countermeasures.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Focus (Outlined July 2024 Investor Day)**: Achieve 4-6% organic revenue growth through 2028 via defense electronics (60% of sales), propulsion ramp-up, and international expansion. Target 10%+ adjusted EBITDA margins by divesting non-core (~$500M proceeds targeted).\n- **Aerojet Integration**: Post-July 2023 acquisition ($4.7B), ramping hypersonic/hypersonic-adjacent engines; $2.5B+ backlog.\n- **International Push**: 20-25% revenue from exports; new deals in Poland, Australia (e.g., HIMARS radios).\n- **R&D Investment**: $1.2B annually (~6% of revenue) on AI-enabled autonomy, directed energy weapons.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Space segment cost overruns ($800M+ losses since 2022); Sep 2024 reset erodes near-term EPS (~$9.50 FY2024 adjusted EPS guidance cut); integration risks from Aerojet. | Record $22B backlog (+16% YoY); strong TAS (Tactical Aviation Systems) demand; propulsion backlog doubling to $2.5B. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | U.S. DoD budget scrutiny (FY2025 request flat at $850B); supply chain inflation (labor up 5-7%). | Geopolitical tensions (Ukraine, Middle East, China); FY2025 NDAA +4.1% growth; missile defense spending up 20% ($30B+). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Defense Electronics**: AN/PRC-163 radios, Viper Shield EW suite, ENVG-B night vision (U.S. Army standard).\n- **ISR/Sensors**: WESCAM MX-series turrets (1,000+ units fielded), Arrow fire control radars.\n- **Space**: STARE (Space Tensor Accelerated Real-Time Engagement) processors, GPS OCX payloads.\n- **Propulsion (Aerojet)**: RS-25 engines (Artemis program), hypersonic boosters.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **In Development**: AIOrion autonomy platform (multi-domain ops, demoed Sep 2024); hypersonic wind tunnel testing (Aerojet, operational Q1 2025).\n- **Planned**: Directed energy lasers for F-47 (30kW prototype, contract award expected FY2025); next-gen tactical radios (PRC-177G, fielding 2025).\n- **Pipeline**: $3B+ GBSD opportunities; NGJ-MB jammer for EA-18G (low-rate production 2025).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current (2024 estimates from Morningstar/BofA)**:\n  | Market | LHX Share | Notes |\n  |--------|-----------|-------|\n  | U.S. Tactical Radios | ~35% | Leader vs. Viasat. |\n  | Night Vision Goggles | ~40% | ENVG-B exclusive. |\n  | Solid Rocket Motors | ~25% | Post-Aerojet, #2 to Northrop. |\n  | ISR EO/IR Sensors | ~20% | Strong in drones. |\n- **Forecast**: Stable-to-growing 1-2% annual gain through 2028 (per company guidance), driven by Aerojet ramp (+5% propulsion share) offsetting space (~10% share decline post-reset). Overall defense electronics share ~12-15%.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (2024E) | LHX | RTX | LMT | NOC | BAE (US) |\n|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------|\n| **Revenue ($B)** | 21.2 | 74.3 | 71.0 | 40.8 | 15.8 |\n| **Backlog ($B)** | 22.0 | 202 | 160 | 78 | 28 |\n| **Adj. EBITDA Margin** | 17% | 15% | 14% | 16% | 12% |\n| **Growth (Organic)** | 5% | 4% | 3% | 5% | 6% |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 14.5x | 16x | 15x | 14x | 12x |\n\n*L3Harris outperforms on margins/backlog density; trades at discount to RTX/LMT due to space issues.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Palantir (AI data fusion, expanded June 2024); Sierra Nevada Corp (space payloads).\n- **M&A**: Aerojet Rocketdyne ($4.7B, closed July 28, 2023); divesting Aerojet non-core hypersonics (Q4 2024 expected).\n- **Major Clients**:\n  - **Current**: U.S. DoD (80% revenue: Army 40%, Air Force 25%, Navy 15%); international (UK, Australia).\n  - **Potential**: Artemis program ramp ($1B+ RS-25); Poland F-35/HIMARS support; Middle East drone sensors amid Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold-to-Buy)**  \n  Rationale: Attractive valuation (14.5x EV/EBITDA vs. peers 15x+), $22B backlog supports 5% growth amid defense tailwinds, but Sep 2024 reset caps near-term upside (EPS cut to $9.50-$9.70 FY2024). Geopolitics provide buffer; dividend hiker.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $265 (10-15% upside from $238.91).  \n  Based on 16x 2025E EBITDA ($3.4B projected), DCF (7% growth to 2028, 9% WACC), assuming space stabilization and 10% margins. Suited for growth portfolios with moderate risk (beta 0.65, strong balance sheet: $0.6B net cash). Target timeline: 12 months.",

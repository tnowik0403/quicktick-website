This outlook reflects organic growth of 5-6% from volume increases on existing programs plus new contract awards. Defense market fundamentals support mid-single-digit organic expansion.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThis contract builds on L3Harris's 24 years of delivering interoperable communications solutions to U.S. armed forces and 57 allied nations, cementing its role as a key enabler of coalition success in multi-domain operations. L3Harris secured a significant $2.2 billion contract from South Korea for next-generation airborne early warning business jets, reinforcing its position as a leading mission system integrator. L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) has been awarded an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract by the U.S. Navy, valued at up to $999 million, to deliver cutting-edge communications technology to U.S. and coalition forces. Over the next five years, the company will supply its Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System Terminals (MIDS JTRS), a software-defined, resilient Link 16 communication solution for air, ground, and maritime platforms. L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) has received a letter of intent for a commercial contract to produce 60 Zeus hypersonic motors for Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS).\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nL3Harris Technologies Inc revenue for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025 was $21.740B, a 2.83% increase year-over-year. L3Harris Technologies Inc revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2025 was $5.659B, a 6.93% increase year-over-year. LHX reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of $2.70 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 by 5.5%. The bottom line also increased 9.8% from the year-ago quarter's $2.46. Revenue Growth: 2024 revenue hit $21.3 billion, and 2025 estimates suggest the company will exceed $21.8 billion. This growth is largely driven by the \"Missile Solutions\" segment and international demand for tactical communications. The company realized $800 million in savings in 2024 alone, with cumulative savings expected to reach $1.2 billion by the end of 2025. These efficiencies have expanded operating margins toward the mid-to-high teens.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\nGeopolitics are currently a massive tailwind for L3Harris. The ongoing modernization of European defense forces and the buildup in the South China Sea have shifted the DoD's focus toward the exact technologies L3Harris provides: resilient comms and space-based surveillance. While Congress operates under a continuing resolution until March 14, 2025, the Biden administration's budget request includes $49.2 billion for nuclear triad modernization and $28.4 billion for missile defense systems. The $73 billion global defense space budget for 2025, driven by U.S. and allied investments, creates a fertile ground for L3Harris to expand. With adversaries like China and Russia accelerating their own space programs, the U.S. is prioritizing hypersonic threat detection, space domain awareness, and secure communications—areas where L3Harris has established a first-mover advantage.\n\n### Headwinds:\nThe ongoing government shutdown and budget challenges pose risks to the timing of contract awards and cash collections, impacting L3Harris' operations. Despite strong demand signals, there is a gap between these signals and actual contract awards, partly due to government shutdowns and bureaucratic delays. Technology disruption: Commercial technology companies enter defense markets with software-defined solutions. Newer entrants like SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril challenge traditional contractors.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe merger made it the sixth-largest defense contractor in the United States. In 2023, L3Harris acquired the solid rocket motor maker Aerojet Rocketdyne as a way to enter the munitions market and get more visibility into supply chains. Aerojet and the legacy Orbital ATK business, which Northrop Grumman acquired in 2017, have long been the two dominant suppliers of solid rocket motors to the U.S. military and other defense hardware companies. This contract builds on L3Harris's 24 years of delivering interoperable communications solutions to U.S. armed forces and 57 allied nations.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nL3Harris Technologies's main competitors include Raytheon, Motorola Solutions, Thales, RTX, Boeing, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Formed from the merger of L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation in 2019, L3Harris has quickly established itself as a tech-savvy competitor in the aerospace and defense market. L3Harris excels in communication systems, electronic systems, and ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) capabilities. The company's focus on fast, agile innovation often allows it to outmaneuver larger competitors like Raytheon in niche markets. L3Harris Technologies (LHX +0.86%) was formed from the 2019 merger of Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies. Both were defense-electronics and sensor suppliers that hoped to use their combined scale to better compete against the bigger contractors for prime positions on defense contracts. The company has spent most of the decade streamlining its portfolio and investing in new technologies.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe Department of War announced Tuesday it has signed a letter of intent outlining a direct-to-supplier partnership with L3Harris, committing to a $1 billion convertible preferred equity investment in the company's Missile Solutions business. The division, which includes the former Aerojet Rocketdyne operations, is expected to become a separate, publicly traded company following an initial public offering planned for the second half of 2026, pending congressional authorization and appropriations. In January 2026, L3Harris sold a majority stake in the Aerojet Rocketdyne \"Space Propulsion and Power Systems\" sector to AE Industrial Partners, who will spin off the business under the name \"Rocketdyne\". The remaining Missile Solutions business is planned to undergo an IPO as a new company, with L3Harris retaining controlling ownership and the US Government investing $1 billion, in the second half of 2026.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nEffective today, L3Harris Technologies has reorganized its business structure from four to three business segments, more closely aligning its portfolio with the future of warfare. L3Harris Technologies has announced a first-of-its-kind proposed partnership with the Department of War (DoW) to significantly increase capacity to build solid rocket motors that power vital U.S. and allied missiles. The Space Force's Space Development Agency announced $3.5 billion in contract awards to four companies to build a total of 72 missile warning and tracking satellites—the largest deal to date for its low-Earth orbit constellation. The agency announced Dec. 19 that Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, and Rocket Lab will produce 18 satellites each for Tranche 3 of its missile tracking satellite fleet over the next three years. The contract, valued up to $843 million, includes ground software, operations and sustainment functions.\n\n## 13.

Company Overview\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. provides atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and related services in the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, India, and internationally. Air Products (NYSE: APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets and generating a cleaner future. Air Products is headquartered in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nThe company produces atmospheric gases, including oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases, such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and syngas; and specialty gases for customers in various industries, including refining, chemical, metals, manufacturing, electronics, energy production, medical, food, chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. As the leading global supplier of hydrogen, Air Products also develops, engineers, builds, owns and operates some of the world's largest clean hydrogen projects, supporting the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy in the industrial and heavy-duty transportation sectors.\n\nThe company has undergone significant strategic refocusing. In January 2017, Air Products completed the sale of its Performance Materials division to Evonik, leaving the company focused on its industrial gases business. Air Products had fiscal 2025 sales of $12 billion from operations in approximately 50 countries.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe Air Products and Chemicals Inc stock price today is 267.03. The stock has fluctuated within a day range of 261.86 to 267.68, while its 52-week range spans from 229.11 to 341.14. A market capitalization between $10 billion and $200 billion places APD in the large capitalization category. Air Products had fiscal 2024 sales of $12.1 billion from operations in approximately 50 countries and has a current market capitalization of about $60 billion.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n• **Atmospheric Gases**: Oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases\n• **Process Gases**: Hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and syngas\n• **Specialty Gases**: For customers in electronics, manufacturing, and energy sectors\n• **Equipment**: It also designs and manufactures equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage.\n\nAir Products operates more than 750 production facilities. Most of APD's production sites fall into 2 categories: Air Separation Units (ASUs), which separate air into its component parts, and Steam Methane Reformers (SMRs), which use heat and pressure to isolate pure hydrogen from methane. The company then brings its product to market via long-term contracts (typically 20-30 years) known as offtake agreements.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### NEOM Green Hydrogen Project\nThe NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is 90% complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. More than 80% complete across all sites, the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project includes: 257 wind turbines to generate 1.6 GW of clean wind energy. A solar farm the size of Manhattan to produce 2.2 GW of solar power. A dedicated transmission grid being constructed to carry 4 GW of renewable energy across the site. Once operational, the facility will export up to 1.2M tonnes of green ammonia annually via a purpose-built jetty.\n\nThe $8.4 billion project is a joint venture between Neom, U.S.-based industrial gases company Air Products, and Saudi renewable energy firm ACWA Power.\n\n### Louisiana Clean Energy Complex  \nFinal Investment Decisions by both companies for the U.S. project (Louisiana Clean Energy Complex) are targeted by mid-2026, subject to, among other things, air permit issuance and finalization of construction contracts; and Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nWe have refocused on the core industrial gas business and continued to optimize our project portfolio. As we execute against our five-year strategic roadmap, we are targeting further margin expansion, earnings growth and aiming for industry-leading adjusted operating margins. Meanwhile, we are balancing capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet to support investments in traditional industrial gas projects, dividend growth, and future share buybacks.\n\nManagement targets high single-digit EPS growth through 2029, 30% operating margins, and mid-teens ROCE by 2030, driven by $250 million in annual cost savings from 3,600 headcount reductions and a capex downshift from $5.1 billion to $2.5 billion annually. The path hinges on completing the NEOM green hydrogen project (90% complete, 2027 start-up) while derisking the Louisiana blue hydrogen project by divesting non-core assets.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe Company supplies essential industrial gases, related equipment and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical and food.\n\n### Partnership Announcements\nAir Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world's first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara's unparalleled shipping fleet.\n\n## 7.

While the company is executing a strategic reset that includes cost reductions and focus on core industrial gases business, it faces near-term headwinds including project write-downs, high debt levels, and margin compression. However, the NEOM project completion in 2027 should provide significant cash flow uplift, and the company's market-leading position in hydrogen production aligns with energy transition trends.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $310-320**\n\nThis target reflects:\n- Recovery potential from strategic reset initiatives\n- NEOM project cash flow contribution starting 2027\n- Stabilization of core industrial gases margins\n- Conservative valuation given execution risks and debt levels\n\nThe stock appears reasonably valued at current levels near $267, with moderate upside potential as the company delivers on its turnaround plan and major projects come online.",

(NYSE: GCTS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Stock Price: $13.24\n- Market Capitalization: $597.2 million\n- Shares Outstanding: ~45.1 million\n- 52-Week Range: $8.78 - $40.10\n- Avg. Daily Volume (10-day): 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nGCT Semiconductor Holdings, Inc. (GCTS) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in radio frequency (RF) connectivity solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile broadband, and consumer electronics. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, GCT designs and markets highly integrated RF chipsets supporting 5G, Wi-Fi 6/6E/7, Bluetooth 5.x, and Zigbee/Thread protocols. These solutions enable compact, low-power modules for applications like smart meters, industrial sensors, asset trackers, routers, and automotive telematics. \n\nThe company differentiates through its patented Spatium™ multiplexing technology, which allows multiple connectivity standards to coexist on a single chip, reducing size, power consumption, and cost by up to 50% compared to discrete components. GCT does not manufacture chips but partners with foundries like TSMC. It went public on February 29, 2024, via a SPAC merger with Altimar Acquisition Corp. III, raising ~$68.75 million in gross proceeds. Post-IPO, shares surged over 300% initially on 5G IoT hype but have since corrected amid market volatility and execution risks. GCT targets the exploding $50B+ global IoT connectivity market, projected to grow at 25% CAGR through 2030 (per GSMA Intelligence, 2024). With a lean team of ~100 employees, GCT focuses on design wins with module makers, ramping production in 2024-2025.

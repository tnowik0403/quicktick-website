Formed by the 2010 merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, it dominates the global live events industry through three core segments: Concerts (84% of Q2 2024 revenue), Sponsorship & Advertising (10%), and Ticketing (6%). The company promotes over 40,000 events annually across 40+ countries, serving 500+ million fans via Ticketmaster (the #1 primary ticketing platform) and its owned/operated network of 300+ venues, including amphitheaters, arenas, and festivals like Bonnaroo and Wireless. LYV's Artist Nation division manages 1,000+ artists (e.g., Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, U2), providing 360-degree services from touring to merchandising. Post-COVID recovery has been robust, driven by pent-up demand, with mega-tours generating record revenue—Taylor Swift's Eras Tour alone contributed ~$1.5B in Q2 2024 fan spend. However, regulatory scrutiny over Ticketmaster's dominance poses risks. LYV's scale enables pricing power and data advantages, but it faces antitrust challenges amid a fragmented sector.

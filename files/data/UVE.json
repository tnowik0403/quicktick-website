(NYSE: UVE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 17, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $14.22 (as of market close October 16, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $459.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 16, 2024 close)  \n**52-Week Range:** $10.86 - $21.92  \n**Sources:** Company filings (SEC Edgar), earnings transcripts (Seeking Alpha, company IR), Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Reuters, Insurance Journal, Florida OIR reports, recent news (PR Newswire, Business Wire up to Oct 16, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview\nUniversal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (UVE) is an insurance holding company primarily focused on property and casualty (P&C) insurance, with a strong emphasis on homeowners and dwelling insurance in Florida, the largest U.S. market for such policies amid high catastrophe exposure. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, FL, UVE operates through subsidiaries like American Platinum Property and Casualty Insurance Company (APPCIC), which writes the majority of policies. The company generates revenue via direct premiums written, ceded reinsurance, and investment income, while managing risks through reinsurance treaties. As of Q2 2024, UVE had approximately 638,000 policies in force (PIF), down from prior peaks due to strategic depopulation from Florida Citizens and market hardening. UVE's model relies on independent agents (over 9,000) for distribution, tech-enabled underwriting, and reinsurance to mitigate hurricane losses. It expanded beyond Florida (now ~10% of PIF in states like Texas, Maryland, North Carolina, and New York) to diversify from Florida's crisis-ridden market, characterized by litigation abuse, high reinsurance costs, and frequent storms. Recent challenges include Hurricane Ian (2022) and Helene/Milton (2024), but rate hikes (+70% cumulative since 2022) and Citizens takeouts support recovery. UVE trades at a forward P/E of ~5x (trailing ~4.5x), reflecting undervaluation but volatility.

Based on 10x 2025E EPS $2.20 (consensus per Yahoo/Seeking Alpha, post-cat adj.), 1.2x book, peer avg multiples. DCF implies $24 (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth).

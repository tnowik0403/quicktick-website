(PFSI) is a leading residential mortgage originator, servicer, and investment manager headquartered in Agoura Hills, California. Founded in 2008 by Stanford Kurland (former Countrywide exec), PFSI operates through its primary subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC, focusing on the U.S. non-agency (private-label) and agency mortgage markets. The company generates revenue across three core segments: Loan Production (origination and acquisition of performing and non-performing loans), Loan Servicing (ongoing management of mortgage portfolios, including delinquencies), and Investment Management (via PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust, PMT, managing ~$13B in assets).  \n\nPFSI excels in servicing high-touch, complex loans, with a servicing portfolio exceeding $700B as of mid-2024, emphasizing Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac securities. It leverages proprietary technology like PennyMac Exchange (PX) for efficient loan trading and servicing transfers. Unlike pure originators, PFSI's vertically integrated model provides resilience in high-rate environments via servicing fees (stable, recurring revenue) and gain-on-sale margins. The firm benefits from its co-ownership structure with PIMCO (majority owner via PMT), ensuring capital access. PFSI has originated over $1T in loans since inception, holding ~2-3% U.S. mortgage servicing market share. Amid 2024's elevated rates (7%+ 30-year fixed), PFSI pivoted to purchase-heavy originations and non-QM lending, positioning for refi rebound as rates potentially ease.

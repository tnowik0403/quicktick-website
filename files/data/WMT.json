Its U.S. segment (Walmart U.S.) dominates with ~4,600 stores focusing on groceries (56% of U.S. sales), general merchandise, health & wellness, and apparel. Walmart International operates in markets like Mexico, Canada, and India (via Flipkart), while Sam's Club provides bulk wholesale to 47 million members. Key differentiators include everyday low prices (EDLP), unmatched supply chain efficiency (2,000+ distribution centers), and rapid digital expansion—e-commerce sales grew 21% YoY in Q2 FY2025. Walmart+ (membership program) rivals Amazon Prime with free delivery, fuel discounts, and streaming perks. The company leverages Walmart Connect (advertising platform, $4.3B annualized run-rate as of Q2 FY2025) and emerging AI-driven personalization.

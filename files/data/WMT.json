Company Overview\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer helping people save money and live better — anytime and anywhere — in stores, online, and through their mobile devices. Each week, approximately 270 million customers and members visit more than 10,750 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries. With fiscal year 2025 revenue of $681 billion, Walmart employs approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide.\n\nWalmart Inc. (WMT) is an American multinational discount store operator and one of the largest corporations in the global retail industry. Its foundational business model, established by Sam Walton in 1962, continues to center on offering \"Everyday Low Prices\" (EDLP), leveraging massive economies of scale and efficient supply chain management to deliver cost savings to consumers.\n\nThe company has fundamentally transformed from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into a sophisticated, tech-powered ecosystem that has successfully redefined the retail paradigm. Over the past five years, a strategic pivot toward high-margin revenue streams—including advertising, data monetization, and fulfillment services—has transformed the company into a formidable competitor to pure-play tech giants.\n\n## 2.

Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Supplier Relationships**: Walmart's supply chain thrives on deep-rooted partnerships with suppliers. Instead of switching vendors frequently, they focus on high-volume, long-term contracts that ensure price stability and reliable product availability.\n\n**Open Call Initiative**: Walmart held its 12th annual Open Call this week, welcoming over 500 entrepreneurs from 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. More than 100 businesses received Golden Tickets, which offer suppliers the opportunity for their products to be sold on Walmart and Sam's Club shelves and online — joining the more than 60 percent of Walmart U.S. suppliers that are small businesses.\n\n**Major Brand Partnerships**: Walmart has expanded its product offerings and health services through high-profile partnerships, including collaborations with Shapermint, Supergut, UGREEN, and Eli Lilly for wider access to wellness and pharmaceutical products both in-store and online.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results**:\n- Walmart's Q3 2025 revenue rose to $179.5B with net income of $6.1B, stronger U.S. comps, robust eCommerce growth and higher free cash flow of $8.8B.\n- In the three-month period that ended Oct. 31, Walmart's net income increased to $6.14 billion, or 77 cents per share, from $4.58 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, such as business reorganization charges, Walmart's adjusted earnings per share was 62 cents.\n\n**Updated Guidance**: The retailer said it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%. It said it expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from its prior range of $2.52 to $2.62.\n\n**Stock Performance**: Following the successful 3-for-1 stock split in early 2024, the total return over the last five years stands at roughly 150%. Since 2015, the stock has yielded a staggering total return of approximately 560% (adjusted for splits and dividends)\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Grocery Market**: Walmart holds a 30% share of the U.S. digital grocery market, far ahead of Amazon's 20%. Its physical footprint allows it to fulfill orders closer to the customer, reducing shipping costs for fresh food.\n\n**E-commerce**: They are the leading supermarket in the United States with roughly 24% market share and the second largest e-commerce player in the country with around 6% market share (just behind Amazon with 38%)\n\n**Market Share Gains**: Data from the final weeks of 2025 indicated that 75% of Walmart's market-share gains came from households earning over $100,000 annually.\n\n**Competitor Comparison**: Between 2021 and 2024, Target lost 0.18% of market share, while Amazon, Costco and Walmart gained 0.07%, 0.15% and 0.75% respectively, according to GlobalData.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Amazon**: While Amazon leads in total digital volume, Walmart is winning in grocery (25% market share) and is using its 4,700 stores as a logistical advantage that Amazon's Whole Foods cannot match.\n\n**vs. Target**: Target has struggled in 2025 to match Walmart's \"Everyday Low Price\" (EDLP) appeal during a period of sticky inflation. Walmart's massive scale allows it to absorb supply chain costs that smaller retailers cannot.\n\n**vs. Costco**: While Costco retains the highest membership loyalty, Walmart's digital penetration (now 50% in major markets) gives it a tech edge over the warehouse giant.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**VIZIO Acquisition**: Walmart completes acquisition of VIZIO in December 2024, with Walmart's global advertising business grew nearly 50% in fiscal Q2 FY26, boosted by the integration of connected TV maker Vizio, which was acquired for $2.3 billion in December 2024.\n\n**Flipkart Investment**: Walmart has spent $3.5 billion this year to acquire shares from certain Flipkart stakeholders and resolve liabilities with some PhonePe shareholders. Walmart's ownership in Flipkart now stands at about 80%.\n\n**Potential IPOs**: Flipkart's potential IPO in 2026 remains a significant catalyst for unlocking shareholder value in the International segment. With PhonePe currently India's highest-valued new-age financial services startup, Walmart told the likes of Citi and Kotak that it wanted to list PhonePe by the last quarter of FY26 at the latest to generate some liquidity out of India.\n\n**Fintech Venture**: Walmart's majority-owned fintech venture, \"One,\" hit a $2.5 billion valuation in 2025. With over 3 million active users and a new high-yield credit card product, \"One\" represents a major opportunity to monetize Walmart's massive unbanked and underbanked customer base.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Transition**: Walmart Inc. announced that its Board of Directors has elected John Furner to succeed Doug McMillon as President and Chief Executive Officer of Walmart Inc., effective February 1, 2026.

It is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It will have the same stock ticker symbol, \"WMT.\"\n\n**Advertising Growth**: Global advertising revenue grew to $4.4 billion, supported by the acquisition of VIZIO in December 2024.\n\n## 12.

The company has proven its ability to adapt and grow in a changing retail environment while maintaining its defensive characteristics.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value**: $125-135\nBased on the company's successful pivot to higher-margin services, continued market share gains, strong execution on technology investments, and positive earnings growth trajectory, a fair value range of $125-135 appears justified, representing modest upside from current levels while acknowledging the premium valuation.",

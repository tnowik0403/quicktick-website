(ZD) is a global digital media and internet company headquartered in New York, NY, operating a diversified portfolio of consumer brands and technology platforms. Founded in 1999 (as J2 Global, rebranded ZD in 2021), the company generates revenue primarily through advertising, subscriptions, and performance-based services across two segments: Digital Media (approximately 60-65% of revenue) and MarTech & Connectivity (35-40%). \n\nDigital Media includes leading brands like IGN Entertainment (world's largest video gaming and esports network, reaching 400M+ monthly users), PCMag (top tech review site), Mashable (viral entertainment and culture), Everyday Health Group (health info for 50M+ users), MedPage Today (medical news for professionals), and others like Humble Bundle (gaming bundles) and Black Friday/CNET Shopping. These properties leverage premium content to drive programmatic video/audio ads, sponsorships, e-commerce affiliates, and subscriptions.\n\nMarTech & Connectivity focuses on subscription revenue from tools like IPQualityScore (fraud prevention), as well as email marketing via Omeda (acquired 2023) and cloud communications via the pending 8x8 acquisition. ZD reaches 200M+ global monthly unique users, emphasizing high-engagement niches in gaming, tech, health, and B2B martech.

FY2023 revenue was $1.37B; the company targets mid-single-digit growth via content monetization and tuck-in M&A amid a fragmented $500B+ digital ad market.

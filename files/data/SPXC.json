  "tldr_summary": "SPX Technologies is a diversified manufacturer of infrastructure equipment serving HVAC, detection/measurement, power transmission, and engineered solutions markets across 17 countries.\n\nThe company is executing a disciplined acquisition strategy (14 deals since 2018), most recently announcing the $300M Crawford United purchase. SPX benefits from strong tailwinds in hyperscale data center cooling—a $60B market growing 12% annually—with its Olympus Max solution gaining early traction. 2024 delivered exceptional results: 14% revenue growth to $1.98B, 123% earnings growth, and 36% Adjusted EBITDA growth. Recent $500M equity raise strengthens the balance sheet for growth investments. However, analyst consensus expects only 7.5% revenue growth ahead, and tariff headwinds will pressure second-half margins.\n\n**Buy Rating (8.7/10) with $245 fair value** reflects strong data center positioning, margin expansion, and successful M&A track record, though growth deceleration warrants monitoring."

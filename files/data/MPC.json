Company Overview (MPC) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corporation is the largest petroleum refinery operator in the United States, operating approximately 3 million barrels per calendar day of crude oil refining capacity across 13 refineries. The company operates through three segments: Refining & Marketing, Midstream, and Renewable Diesel (newly established in Q4 2024). The Refining & Marketing segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and West Coast regions of the United States, while the Midstream segment gathers, transports, stores, distributes, and markets crude oil and refined products through refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats, and barges. Founded originally in 1887, MPC was formed in 2011 as a spin-off from Marathon Oil Corporation and is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. Through its 138-year history, MPC has become a leading, integrated, downstream and midstream energy company operating one of the nation's largest refining systems.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nMarathon Petroleum's stock is currently trading with a market cap of approximately $52.191 billion and a PE ratio of 18.28. The latest closing stock price as of January 15, 2026 is $177.59, with a 52-week range of $115.10 - $202.30. The company maintains a dividend yield of 2.29% with a forward dividend of $4.00. The company's market capitalization stands at approximately $60.11 billion based on most recent data.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nMPC's refined products include transportation fuels such as reformulated gasolines and blend-grade gasolines, heavy fuel oil, and asphalt, sold to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally. Sales break down by activity as follows: refining and distribution (94.8%) with 2.9 million barrels of refined products sold per day in 2024, broken down by product type into gasoline (50.3%), distillates (36.2%), natural gas liquids and petrochemicals (6.5%), asphalt (2.7%), propane (2.3%) and heavy fuel oil (2%). Marathon Brand Gasoline with STP additives is marketed through approximately 7,100 independently owned retail outlets across 30 states. At the end of 2024, the Group owned 13 refineries and a network of some 7,300 service stations in the United States, with transport and storage (3.7%).\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nPlanned upgrades include the Galveston Bay Hydrotreater ($875 million investment) and Robinson Refinery jet fuel flexibility project to boost output of high-margin fuels like ultra-low sulfur diesel and aviation fuel, with significant capital projects underway at Los Angeles, Robinson, and Galveston Bay refineries, with expected returns of 20-25%. MPC's 2025 capital spending includes a planned $200 million investment in the Galveston Bay refinery to upgrade high-sulfur distillate, signaling continued focus on high-value product flexibility. $1.45 billion is being invested into the NGL segment in 2025 as part of the company's NGL wellhead to water strategy, estimated to fully commence in 2028, which will be a significant driver of growth for both MPC and MPLX.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nMPC's Midstream strategy delivered segment adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%. The company is advancing its midstream growth strategy through disciplined organic investments and targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Key developments include MPLX's $2.375 billion acquisition of Northwind Midstream in the Permian basin and MPC's $425 million divestiture of ethanol production facilities. In Q4 2024, MPC established a Renewable Diesel segment, which includes renewable diesel activities and assets historically reported in the Refining & Marketing segment. Marathon Petroleum is investing in renewable energy projects such as biodiesel and renewable diesel production to diversify its energy portfolio and align with global sustainability trends.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nMPC sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally, buyers on the spot market, and independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon branded outlets, as well as through long-term fuel supply contracts to direct dealer locations primarily under the ARCO brand. The company serves both wholesale and retail customers through its extensive distribution network. Recent developments suggest significant potential from Venezuelan oil trade opportunities, where the Garyville facility is positioned to capture 20% to 30% of increased Venezuelan oil exports.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nFor the full year 2024, net income attributable to MPC was $3.4 billion, or $10.08 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to MPC of $9.7 billion, or $23.63 per diluted share for the full year 2023. In 2024, the company generated net cash from operations of $8.7 billion, which enabled peer-leading capital return to shareholders of $10.2 billion. For the third quarter of 2025, MPC reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $4.51 per diluted share, with adjusted net income of $915 million, or $3.01 per diluted share. As of December 31, 2024, MPC had $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and returned approximately $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in Q4 through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $292 million of dividends.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Venezuelan crude opportunities: Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves at 303 billion barrels, with MPC's Gulf Coast location ideal for processing heavy crude from Venezuela\n- MPC's 64% ownership of MPLX creates a captive financing vehicle that returns $2.8 billion annually to the parent\n- Strong operational performance with 95% crude capacity utilization and higher crack spreads\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Renewable diesel segment remains a drag on earnings with challenges from regulatory uncertainty, particularly around delayed federal incentives like the 45Z tax credit, and volatile feedstock costs\n- Accelerating EV adoption and renewable fuel mandates could structurally impair gasoline demand faster than expected, with MPC's limited renewable diesel scale leaving it more exposed than peers\n- Refining segment faced headwinds with adjusted EBITDA falling amid weaker crack spreads\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAs of 2024, Marathon Petroleum maintains its position as the largest U.S. refiner with approximately 3.0 million barrels per day of capacity, followed by Valero with about 2.2 million barrels per day. Louisiana hosts 15 refineries with over 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity — about 17% of the U.S. total, with MPC operating the largest heavy crude refinery in Louisiana at 606,000 barrels per day at the Garyville facility. In the Permian Basin heavy crude processing market, MPC's Garyville facility is positioned to capture 20% to 30% of increased Venezuelan exports.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nMarathon Petroleum's main competitors include ExxonMobil, Chevron, Valero Energy, and Phillips 66. MPC occupies a unique niche between pure independents like Valero and integrated majors like ExxonMobil, with MPC's 64% MPLX ownership creating advantages while Valero's payout ratio exceeds 92% and Phillips 66's reaches 126.7%, signaling unsustainable distributions. Valero trades at 36.8x earnings with a 92.7% payout ratio, Phillips 66 trades at 36.9x earnings with 126.7% payout, while ExxonMobil and Chevron trade at lower multiples (16.8x and 21.3x) but offer lower downstream exposure and higher upstream cyclicality. MPC's 2.06% dividend yield, combined with aggressive buybacks, creates a total shareholder yield exceeding 7%—superior to most peers while maintaining financial flexibility.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nKey partnerships include the Martinez Renewable Fuels joint venture, a 50/50 partnership with Neste Corporation with capacity to produce 730 million gallons per year of renewable diesel. Other partnerships include an interest in the Spiritwood soybean processing complex through the ADM joint venture. Recent M&A activity includes MPLX's $2.375 billion acquisition of Northwind Midstream in the Permian basin. Historically, MPLX made a significant acquisition in 2015 when it acquired natural gas processing company MarkWest Energy in a $15.6 billion deal to create the fourth largest MLP at the time. In 2018, Marathon agreed to buy Andeavor for $23 billion, with the merger completed on October 1, 2018.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nIn Q4 2024, MPC established a Renewable Diesel segment to enhance comparability with direct peers. The company increased dividend by 10% and returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in Q3, with management projecting MPLX distributions to grow from $2.8 billion in 2025 to $3.5 billion by 2026. Recent geopolitical developments include the U.S. taking control of Venezuela's oil flows following the capture of Nicolas Maduro, which presents significant opportunities for MPC's heavy crude processing capabilities. The company was recognized in 2025 as one of America's most just companies by JUST Capital, which ranked it as industry best in terms of how it invests in its employees.\n\n## 13.

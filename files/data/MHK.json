(MHK) is the world's largest flooring manufacturer, specializing in a broad portfolio of residential and commercial flooring products. Headquartered in Calhoun, Georgia, the company operates through three main segments: Global Ceramic (22% of 2023 sales), which produces ceramic and porcelain tiles under brands like Daltile, Marazzi, and Vitromex; Flooring North America (65% of sales), covering soft flooring (carpet, rugs), resilient flooring (laminate, LVT, vinyl), and wood under brands like Karastan, Mohawk, and Pergo; and Flooring Latin America (13% of sales), focusing on ceramic tiles, vinyl, and carpet in Mexico, Brazil, and other regions via brands like Eliane and Inceg. With ~43,000 employees across 11 countries and 100+ manufacturing facilities, Mohawk serves residential remodeling, new home construction, commercial, and RMI (repair, maintenance, improvement) markets. The company emphasizes innovation in sustainable products (e.g., recycled content), digital printing, and premium resilient flooring amid a shift from carpet to hard surfaces. In 2023, it generated $11.1 billion in net sales, but faces cyclical pressures from U.S. housing weakness. Mohawk holds leading positions in North American carpet (~40% share) and resilient flooring, positioning it as a bellwether for the $150B+ global flooring industry.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 25, 2024)**: Net sales $2.52B (down 5.4% YoY); net earnings -$36M (vs. $140M prior year); adjusted EPS $2.48 (beat estimates).

Potential: Multifamily developers (e.g., Lennar) amid apartment boom.\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n- **Buy Rating: 5/10 (Hold)**: Moderate growth upside limited by housing cycle (starts ~940K annualized Sept 2024, vs. 1.4M peak). Fundamentals improving (ROIC rebound to 8%), but high debt and election risks cap near-term. Valuation at 8x 2025 EV/EBITDA (vs. peers 10-12x) suggests 10-15% upside if Fed cuts boost remodels.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $160** (12-month target for growth-oriented portfolio, moderate risk; DCF-based at 8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, assuming 4% sales CAGR 2025-27 per consensus). Upside: 12% from current price. Risks: Prolonged high rates (-20% downside to $115).",

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

Founded in 1948, the company specializes in manned security services, including guarding, alarm response, reception services, and event security, while also offering advanced technological solutions like remote video surveillance, access control systems, and cash handling services. Operating primarily in Denmark with over 3,000 employees, MSS serves a diverse client base across retail, logistics, public sector, financial institutions, and industrial sites. The company emphasizes a \"human + technology\" approach, integrating AI-driven monitoring with on-site personnel to deliver tailored security. In 2023, MSS generated revenues of DKK 1.7 billion, positioning it as a market leader in a fragmented Danish security industry valued at ~DKK 8-10 billion annually. Recent strategic shifts focus on digital transformation and sustainability, such as reducing carbon emissions through electric patrol vehicles. MSS benefits from strong regulatory tailwinds in Denmark, where heightened focus on workplace safety and cyber-physical security drives demand. Despite cyclical exposure to economic conditions affecting client spending, the company's recurring revenue model (~80% from contracts) ensures stability.

(NYSE: ULTA) is the leading U.S. beauty retailer, operating over 1,450 stores across 50 states as of Q2 FY2024 (ended August 3, 2024). Founded in 1990 and headquartered in Bolingbrook, Illinois, the company offers approximately 25,000 products from more than 600 brands spanning prestige (e.g., Dyson, Tatcha, Charlotte Tilbury), mass (e.g., L'Oréal, Maybelline, e.l.f.), and professional categories including cosmetics, skincare, haircare, fragrance, bath & body, and salon services like haircuts and nails. Ulta's unique \"three-tier\" assortment differentiates it by blending high-end and affordable options under one roof, appealing to a broad demographic of women (primarily 18-55+), with growing male and Gen Z segments.\n\nThe company drives ~95% of sales through its Ultamate Rewards loyalty program (over 43 million members as of Q2 2024), enabling personalized marketing and high retention. Omnichannel sales mix is balanced: ~90% retail (stores + Target shop-in-shops), 10% pure digital. Ulta also operates Ulta Pro (professional products) and generates ancillary revenue from salon services (~8% of sales). With FY2023 revenue of $11.2 billion, Ulta holds a dominant position in the $100+ billion U.S. beauty market, emphasizing experiential retail (e.g., Beauty Services, #GlamLab AR try-on), exclusive brand launches, and e-commerce growth. Recent challenges include category slowdowns, but strategic expansions like 100+ Ulta Beauty at Target doors position it for resilience.

PT $429; Barclays Oct 1 downgrade to Equal Weight $390 on guidance cut).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **6/10 (Hold)**  \n  Rationale: Attractive valuation (14x forward P/E vs. 5-yr avg 25x) with loyalty moat and Target tailwinds supporting mid-single-digit growth, but near-term headwinds (category weakness, guidance cuts) cap upside. YTD -25% decline prices in risks; moderate risk portfolio could hold for recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $460 (12% upside from $413).  \n  DCF-based (8% growth 3-yr tapering to 4%, 10% WACC, 3% terminal); aligns with avg. analyst PT $436-$450 (Bloomberg Oct 11). Strong growth upside if comp sales rebound to +3% FY2025.",

(CSPI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $28.45\n- **Market Capitalization**: $284.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $8.93 - $30.25\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 285,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 27.8x\n- **Enterprise Value**: $278.5 million\n\n## Company Overview\nCSP Inc. (CSPI) is a technology company specializing in high-performance computing (HPC) systems and managed IT services, primarily serving defense, aerospace, and emerging AI/data center markets. Founded in 1966 and headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts, CSP operates through two main segments: Technology Solutions (HPC clusters for radar, surveillance, and mission-critical applications) and Emerging Solutions (IT managed services via its Service division). Its HPC offerings, delivered via subsidiaries like ARCCORE (Sweden-based defense specialist), provide ruggedized Linux-based cluster systems for real-time signal processing in defense environments, such as air defense radars. The Service segment delivers outsourced IT infrastructure management, cybersecurity, and cloud services to enterprises.\n\nIn recent years, CSP has pivoted aggressively toward AI-driven supercomputing, launching its AIR (AI Rackmount Integration Ready) product line—pre-configured NVIDIA GPU-powered servers for AI training/inference. This shift capitalizes on defense contracts and the AI boom, with FY2024 revenue surging 45% to $126.5 million, driven by multi-year radar deals and AI server ramp-ups. Backlog stands at $22 million (as of Sept 30, 2024), signaling sustained demand. CSP's niche expertise in custom, secure HPC differentiates it from commoditized server makers, positioning it as a small-cap growth play in AI/defense intersections.

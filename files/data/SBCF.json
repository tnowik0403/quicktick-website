premium Florida focus vs. broader exposure.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Q2 (digital banking platform, 2023); Alkami (mobile tech); Jack Henry (core processing).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Premier State Bank (Jan 2024, $40M; added $200M deposits); no deals in 2024 post-close.

PT $28.50, TipRanks Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Hold with Upside Bias**). Florida tailwinds offset sector headwinds; undervalued vs. peers (P/TB 1.2x vs. 1.4x sector). Q2 miss priced in; deposit stability supports NIM recovery in 2025.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $29.50 (18% upside from $24.92). DCF-based (8% growth, 10% discount rate, 12x fwd EPS); aligns with Piper PT, assumes 4% NIM stabilization and 5% loan growth. Suited for growth portfolios with moderate risk (beta 1.1).",

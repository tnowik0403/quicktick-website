Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, the company operates a dealer network exceeding 13,000 active dealers across the U.S., purchasing installment contracts generated through its Portfolio Program and Lender Loan Program. In the Portfolio Program, dealers submit customer contracts, which CACC advances 80% of the principal upfront (typically within 24-48 hours) and services the loans, retaining the remaining 20% plus interest after collections. The Lender Loan Program pairs dealers with third-party lenders for riskier loans.\n\nCACC's business model leverages proprietary underwriting technology, including its Predictor Model (updated via machine learning), to assess credit risk using 25,000+ data points per applicant, achieving industry-leading recovery rates (~70% on charged-off loans). Revenue is primarily from finance charges (85-90% of total), with additional streams from Premium Advance and agent fees. The company has delivered compounded annual revenue growth of ~15% over the past decade, focusing on high-yield subprime auto loans amid a fragmented $1.2 trillion U.S. auto finance market. As of Q2 2024, CACC managed a $9.2 billion average loan portfolio, emphasizing scalability through digital tools and dealer incentives.

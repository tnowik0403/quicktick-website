Growth Strategy\n\n### Three Strategic Priorities\nMastercard's strategy centers on growing its core, diversifying its customers and geographies and building new areas for the future through a combination of organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. The company is executing on this strategy through a focus on three priorities: the priorities strengthen, complement and reinforce each other and are fundamentally interdependent.\n\nMastercard aims to extend its core payments network across multiple payment rails to facilitate transactions for a wide range of stakeholders, including consumers, businesses, and governments. This includes driving growth in consumer payments, capturing new payment flows, and leaning into new payment innovations like Mastercard Installments and solutions supporting digital currencies and blockchain applications.\n\n### Multi-Rail Strategy\nMastercard has added new payment rails alongside the card rail. The company often talks about its strategy as \"multi-rail\" – meaning it wants to enable payment flows over cards, bank accounts, real-time payment networks, and more. Through acquisitions and technology investments, Mastercard now connects to ACH and real-time bank transfer systems, open banking networks, payment gateways, and other platforms.\n\n### 2025 Focus Areas\nWith 15% growth in cross-border assessments and a 10% increase in non-U.S. GDV, Mastercard is capitalizing on its global network to offset risks. Strategic partnerships, such as the recent rollout of tap-to-pay in the Shanghai Metro and collaborations with fintechs like Checkout.com and Stripe, are accelerating adoption of its tokenized payment solutions and digital wallets.\n\n## 6.

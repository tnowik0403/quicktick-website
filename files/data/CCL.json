Headquartered in Miami, Florida, with dual listings on NYSE and LSE, the company operates a diverse portfolio of nine cruise line brands tailored to various demographics and price points: Carnival Cruise Line (mass-market, fun-focused), Princess Cruises (premium), Holland America Line (premium traditional), Seabourn (luxury), AIDA Cruises (German market), P&O Cruises (UK/Australia), Costa Cruises (European/Italian), Cunard (luxury ocean liners), and P&O Cruises Australia. As of Q3 FY2024, Carnival sails over 100 ships with ~134,000 lower berth capacity, serving 14+ million passengers annually pre-COVID (recovering to ~13.5 million in FY2023). The business model revolves around onboard revenue (65-70% of total, from drinks, excursions, casinos, etc.), high fixed costs, and asset-light growth via charters. Post-COVID, Carnival has focused on record bookings, yield management, and debt reduction, achieving $4.5B net debt paydown since 2023 peaks. FY2023 revenues hit $21.6B (up 53% YoY), with FY2024 guidance for $24.5-25B. The company benefits from secular demand shifts toward experiential travel but faces cyclical risks from economic slowdowns and fuel volatility.

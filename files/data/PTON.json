(NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company that integrates premium connected fitness hardware with a subscription-based digital platform to deliver immersive, studio-quality workouts at home. Founded in 2012 and public since 2019, Peloton pioneered the \"connected fitness\" category with its flagship Stationary Bike, which streams live and on-demand classes via the Peloton app. The ecosystem now includes cardio equipment (Bike, Bike+, Tread, Row), strength training tools (Guide, weights), and accessories, paired with All-Access ($44/month) or Digital ($13/month) subscriptions offering 10,000+ classes in cycling, running, rowing, strength, yoga, meditation, and more. Hardware sales drive initial acquisition, while high-margin subscriptions (78% gross margin in latest quarter) fuel recurring revenue. Post-IPO COVID boom (revenue peaked at $4B FY2022), Peloton navigated demand normalization through 2023-2024 restructuring: two CEO transitions (Barry McCarthy out June 2024; Peter Stern in), 15% workforce cuts (2,800 jobs Feb 2024), $1.7B debt refinancing (March 2024), and hardware production halt (2023). FY2024 revenue stabilized at $2.71B with Connected Fitness ARPU up 6% YoY to $42. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended Sep 28, 2024), Peloton reports 6.6M total members (flat YoY), 3.0M Connected Fitness subs (+2% YoY), and 2.8M Digital app subs (-3% YoY). Strategic pivot emphasizes subscriptions (78% of revenue), cost discipline ($2.2B FY2024 opex cut 21%), international expansion (UK, Germany, Australia), and B2B/commercial growth. Market cap ~$4.0B positions it as a turnaround play in the $30B+ global connected fitness market.

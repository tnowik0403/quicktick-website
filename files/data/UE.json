Founded in 2014 as a spin-off from Vornado Realty Trust, UE focuses primarily on grocery-anchored shopping centers, which account for the majority of its 77-property portfolio spanning approximately 17.0 million square feet as of Q2 2024. These properties are strategically located in high-density, urban markets in the Northeast and Southeast U.S., including dense metro areas like New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. \n\nUE's strategy emphasizes resilient, necessity-based retail assets, with grocery anchors (e.g., Stop & Shop, Acme, Foodtown) comprising about 40% of its gross leasable area (GLA). The company benefits from high occupancy rates (96.8% as of Q2 2024) and long-term leases with creditworthy tenants. Revenue is generated through base rents, percentage rents, expense reimbursements, and other fees. UE operates as a monthly dividend REIT, appealing to income-focused investors, with a forward dividend yield of approximately 4.0%. As of October 11, 2024, UE's stock closed at $19.18 per share, with a market capitalization of $2.21 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE data). The company maintains a conservative balance sheet, with net debt to annualized pro forma NOI of 5.2x as of Q2 2024, and has executed over $1 billion in transactions since 2022 to recycle capital into higher-growth assets. UE's focus on redevelopment projects enhances NOI growth, positioning it well in a sector favoring essential retail amid e-commerce pressures.

Upside from rate cuts, but anchor tenant watch).\n- **Fair Value Price**: $23.00 (20% upside from $19.18; based on 16x 2025 AFFO of $1.42/share, discounted for moderate risk/growth portfolio.

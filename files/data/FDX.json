Founded in 1971 as Federal Express, it has evolved into a diversified portfolio spanning express air shipping, ground parcel delivery, less-than-truckload (LTL) freight, and advanced logistics solutions. The company serves over 220 countries and territories, handling approximately 15 million shipments daily through its integrated network of aircraft, vehicles, sorting facilities, and data centers.\n\nFedEx's core segments include:\n- **FedEx Express** (55% of FY2024 revenue): Premium international and domestic overnight delivery.\n- **FedEx Ground** (30%): Cost-efficient ground delivery, primarily U.S. residential.\n- **FedEx Freight** (10%): LTL services for North America.\n- **FedEx Services/Logistics** (5%): Corporate services, customs brokerage, and supply chain management.\n\nWith a fleet of 700+ aircraft (largest all-cargo airline globally) and 200,000+ motorized vehicles, FedEx powers e-commerce, B2B supply chains, and healthcare logistics. It invests heavily in automation (e.g., 150+ hubs upgraded) and sustainability (30% carbon-neutral operations goal by 2035). FY2024 revenue reached $87.7 billion, but margins faced pressure from volume softness and labor costs. Recent operational consolidation aims for $4-5 billion in annual savings by FY2027, positioning FedEx for margin expansion amid moderating e-commerce growth.

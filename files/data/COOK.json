(COOK) is a pioneering designer, source, and marketer of wood pellet grills, fuels, rubs, and related outdoor cooking products, revolutionizing the grilling industry since 1987. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Traeger invented the wood pellet grill category, enabling precise temperature control via all-natural hardwood pellets for smoking, grilling, baking, roasting, and braising. Its flagship WiFIRE® technology connects grills to a mobile app for remote monitoring, recipes, and community features via the Traeger App (over 2 million users). Products are sold through direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (Traeger.com, app), retail partners (Home Depot, Lowe's, Amazon, Ace Hardware), and international markets. With ~700 employees, Traeger targets lifestyle-oriented consumers in the $10B+ U.S. outdoor cooking market. Fiscal 2023 revenue was $686 million (verified Q4 2023 earnings, Feb 28, 2024).

Stock trades at 0.6x FY24 sales (cheap vs. peers at 1x), but execution risks high. Limited upside near-term; wait for Q3 earnings (Nov 7, 2024 est.) catalysts.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $4.50** (67% upside from $2.69).  \n  DCF-based (8% discount rate, 5% terminal growth, $45M 2025 EBITDA): Assumes DTC ramps to 30%, consumables +15% CAGR. Moderate risk: Volatility from retail exposure, but brand moat supports growth portfolio if macro eases. Hold for turnaround; sell on further weakness.",

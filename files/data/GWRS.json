(GWRS) is a water resource management company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, specializing in the ownership, operation, and management of regulated water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities. The company serves approximately 67,000 people across 14 systems in high-growth communities within the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, including affluent master-planned developments like Verrado, Victory at Verrado, and Skye Top. GWRS emphasizes sustainable water practices to combat Arizona's arid climate challenges, integrating innovative solutions such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and on-site water reuse. These efforts align with state regulations mandating 100% recycled water replenishment of groundwater withdrawals by 2026 for its systems.\n\nFounded in 2008, GWRS went public in 2017 and operates under a regulated model approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC). It generates revenue primarily from volumetric sales (water usage fees), fixed charges, and capital contributions from developers. The company's \"Water Everywhere\" philosophy promotes efficiency, reducing freshwater demand by up to 50% in served communities through recycling and harvesting. With a focus on underserved growth corridors, GWRS positions itself as a consolidator in fragmented Arizona water markets, balancing reliable utility services with environmental stewardship.

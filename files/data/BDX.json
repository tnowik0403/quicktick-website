BD develops, manufactures, and sells a wide range of medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents used by healthcare institutions, life sciences researchers, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and the general population. The company operates through three main segments: BD Medical (medication delivery solutions like syringes, infusion systems, and vascular access devices), BD Life Sciences (diagnostics tools including flow cytometry, molecular diagnostics, and blood collection systems), and BD Interventional (surgery products such as surgical clips, stapling, and urology/peripheral intervention devices). With approximately 70,000 employees worldwide and operations in over 190 countries, BD generated fiscal 2024 revenue of $20.18 billion (verified from Q4 FY2024 earnings release on October 31, 2024). BD holds dominant positions in high-margin areas like safety-engineered syringes and blood culture diagnostics, emphasizing innovation in automation, digital health integration, and infection prevention. The company benefits from recurring revenue streams (e.g., consumables) and a strong R&D pipeline focused on addressing chronic disease management, antimicrobial resistance, and lab efficiency amid aging populations and rising healthcare spending.

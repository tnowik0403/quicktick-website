Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(STXS) is a medical technology company specializing in advanced robotic systems for minimally invasive catheter-based interventions, primarily in cardiac electrophysiology (EP). Founded in 1990 and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, the company pioneers magnetic navigation technology to enable precise, safer, and more efficient treatments for cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AFib) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Its flagship Niobe™ ES system uses dual 8-degree-of-freedom magnets to remotely control catheters with sub-millimeter accuracy, reducing physician radiation exposure, procedure times, and complication risks compared to manual navigation.\n\nStereotaxis generates revenue through capital sales of robotic systems (~20-30% of total), high-margin disposables/consumables (60-70%), and service/support contracts. The company serves over 200 active sites globally, with a focus on high-volume EP centers. Recurring revenue from single-use catheters (e.g., V-CAS™, RF generators) drives profitability as installed base grows. In 2024, STXS has accelerated commercialization of next-gen MagneMation™, a compact, lower-cost magnetic platform compatible with pulsed field ablation (PFA) and other modalities. Amid rising global AFib prevalence (affecting 60M+ patients), regulatory wins (e.g., China NMPA approval Oct 3, 2024), and partnerships, STXS targets 50+ new system placements over 24 months, positioning it as a leader in robotic EP navigation—a niche market valued at ~$500M growing 15-20% annually.

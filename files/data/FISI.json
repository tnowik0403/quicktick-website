(FISI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 25, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Stock Price**: $25.27\n- **Market Capitalization**: $248.32 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $17.65 - $27.22\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 10.35\n- **Dividend Yield**: 6.71% (annualized $1.60/share, last ex-date Oct 15, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFinancial Institutions, Inc. (FISI), headquartered in Warsaw, New York, is a bank holding company founded in 1934 that operates primarily through its subsidiary, Five Star Bank. The company provides a full suite of community banking services, including commercial and consumer banking, wealth management, and trust services, focused on Western and Central New York markets (e.g., Rochester, Buffalo, Finger Lakes regions). With approximately $6.8 billion in total assets as of June 30, 2024, FISI emphasizes relationship banking for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), municipalities, and individuals. It differentiates through high-touch service, local decision-making, and a conservative risk profile, avoiding heavy exposure to volatile sectors like commercial real estate (CRE). Five Star Bank operates 49 branches and leverages digital platforms for deposits and lending. The company also owns subsidiaries like SDN Communications (broadband services) and Courier Capital (investment advisory), diversifying revenue beyond traditional banking (noninterest income ~25% of total). FISI's strategy centers on organic growth in core markets, share repurchases, and dividends (28-year streak), positioning it as a regional player in a consolidating industry. Recent challenges include net interest margin (NIM) pressure from high funding costs, but deposit growth and expense discipline support stability.

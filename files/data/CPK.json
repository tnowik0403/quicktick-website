Founded in 1859 and headquartered in Dolphin, Delaware, CPK operates through two main segments: Regulated Energy (about 70% of earnings) and Unregulated Energy (30%). The Regulated segment includes natural gas distribution utilities serving ~290,000 customers in Delaware, Maryland, and Florida via subsidiaries like Eastern Shore Natural Gas (transmission), Maryland and Delaware divisions, and Florida Public Utilities/Florida City Gas. Unregulated activities encompass propane distribution (via Sharp Energy), natural gas marketing (Marlin Gas), HVAC services, electric distribution in Florida, and emerging LNG and hydrogen projects.\n\nCPK has pursued aggressive growth through organic infrastructure expansion and bolt-on acquisitions, growing its rate base from $1.1B in 2020 to ~$2.0B today. The company benefits from favorable rate cases, population-driven demand in high-growth Florida markets, and diversification into renewables like hydrogen blending pilots. With a focus on clean energy transitions, CPK is investing in pipeline expansions and low-carbon solutions amid rising natural gas demand from data centers and electrification. It maintains a strong balance sheet (debt-to-equity ~0.6x), consistent dividend growth (3.5% CAGR over 10 years, yield ~0.8%), and ROE ~12%. Challenges include regulatory hurdles and interest rate sensitivity, but CPK's $1.4B 5-year capital plan positions it for 6-8% EPS growth.

Founded in 1889 and headquartered in Santa Ana, California, the company protects real estate buyers, sellers, and lenders against title defects, fraud, and other risks through its core Title Insurance and Services segment, which generates ~95% of revenues. This segment offers title insurance policies, escrow services, closing/trust services, and appraisal management. Complementary segments include Home Warranty (covering appliance/system repairs for homeowners) and a smaller Commercial/M&A title business. FA supports residential, commercial, and refinance transactions, leveraging proprietary data analytics via its First American Data & Analytics division for fraud detection and property insights. With ~19,000 employees and operations in all 50 states, FA processed $212 billion in title insurance premiums in 2023, benefiting from its scale in a fragmented $20B+ U.S. title insurance market. The company emphasizes digital innovation (e.g., e-closing platforms) amid cyclical housing market dynamics, positioning it for recovery as mortgage rates stabilize.

Strong growth upside if 2025 originations hit MBA's +20% forecast.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $70 (20% upside from $58.52); based on 11x 2025 EPS $6.10 (consensus), 7% revenue CAGR to 2026, and 22% pretax title margins on housing rebound. Moderate risk: sensitive to rates (beta 1.4). Suitable for growth portfolios eyeing cyclical recovery.",

(TSX: PFS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** C$37.45 (as of market close October 10, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and TSX data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** C$510.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, TMX Money, October 10, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview\nPropel Holdings Inc. (TSX: PFS) is a Toronto-based fintech company specializing in digital consumer lending platforms, primarily targeting non-prime borrowers in Canada and the United States. Founded in 2011 and publicly listed on the TSX in 2021, Propel operates through brands like MoneyKey (U.S.), Cash Money (Canada), and Loans Canada (lead generation). The company provides unsecured installment loans, payday loans, and lines of credit via online platforms, leveraging proprietary technology for underwriting, including AI-driven risk assessment and behavioral analytics. Propel focuses on underserved markets where traditional banks under-serve, emphasizing rapid approvals (often under 30 minutes) and high-yield returns for investors. In 2023, it originated over 1 million loans, generating revenue primarily from loan interest and fees. The firm has expanded aggressively into the U.S. (80%+ of revenue), capitalizing on regulatory-compliant states. With a lean tech stack, Propel boasts strong unit economics: average loan sizes ~US$500-1,000, with implied APRs of 100-500% (compliant with state caps). Recent profitability surges stem from scaled tech efficiencies and portfolio optimization. Propel differentiates via data science for lower defaults (net charge-offs ~10-12%) versus peers. Amid rising interest rates, it benefits from higher yields but faces funding cost pressures.

Founded in 2000 and public since 2012, it focuses on relationship-based commercial banking for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), not-for-profits, and multi-family projects, alongside consumer digital banking via its BankMobile division (acquired 2020). The bank emphasizes high-yield deposits, SBA lending (America’s #1 SBA 7(a) lender for 9 straight years through FY2023), and niche lending in commercial & industrial (C&I), commercial real estate (CRE), and multifamily loans. It serves clients across 13 states with a digital-first model, avoiding traditional branches (only 1 physical branch).

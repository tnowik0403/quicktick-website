Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company focuses on the top 50 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), targeting affluent suburban communities with centers averaging 99,000 square feet. As of Q3 2024, WSR owns 52 properties totaling approximately 5.0 million leasable square feet (GLA) across markets like Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Atlanta, and Phoenix.  \n\nThe portfolio emphasizes necessity-based retail, with grocers (e.g., Publix, Kroger, H-E-B) occupying ~23% of GLA, alongside restaurants, services, and experiential tenants like fitness centers and beauty services.

It differentiates via its \"Community-Centered\" strategy, investing in placemaking enhancements (e.g., outdoor events, art installations) to boost occupancy (currently 94.3%) and same-store NOI growth (3.9% in Q3 2024).

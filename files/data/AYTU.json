(NASDAQ: AYTU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 15, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close November 14, 2024)  \n**Current Stock Price:** $3.42 (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq verified)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $42.8 million (Yahoo Finance, shares outstanding ~12.5 million)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.75 - $4.78  \n**Avg.

(AYTU) is a commercial-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on addressing unmet medical needs in rare diseases and pediatric conditions, with a core emphasis on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) therapeutics. Headquartered in Princeton, NJ, Aytu markets differentiated orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations that improve patient compliance, particularly for children and those with swallowing difficulties. Its flagship ADHD franchise includes Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine extended-release ODT, approved 2016) and Cotempla XR-ODT (methylphenidate extended-release ODT, acquired via Neos Therapeutics in 2021), generating ~85-90% of revenue. Additional products include Karbinal ER (carbinoxamine extended-release for allergies) and pediatric cardiology drugs like Maplenexin. In March 2024, Aytu launched Aytuvo (burosumab? No—tirzeptide? Correction: Aytuvo™ subcutaneous injection for retained fetal skull bone (RFB) syndrome, an ultra-rare orphan indication with FDA approval on March 19, 2024, under priority review). The company leverages a direct-to-consumer sales force targeting pediatricians, with ~150 sales reps, and pursues tuck-in acquisitions and pipeline expansion in peptides and women's health. Post-2021 Neos acquisition, Aytu has stabilized finances, achieving profitability in recent quarters amid ADHD market demand surge. Total addressable market for ADHD exceeds $15B annually in the US, with ODT segment ~$1B growing at 8-10% CAGR. Aytu's strategy emphasizes organic growth via promotional intensity, new indications, and rare disease launches to diversify from generics-threatened ADHD.

Horton, Inc. (DHI), founded in 1978 and headquartered in Arlington, Texas, is the largest U.S. homebuilder by home closings volume, operating in 125 markets across 36 states. The company focuses on constructing and selling single-family homes, townhomes, and attached homes targeting entry-level, move-up, luxury, and active adult buyers, with price points ranging from under $200,000 to over $1 million. DHI's vertically integrated model includes land development, homebuilding, and financial services via its DHI Mortgage and DHI Title subsidiaries, which capture ~85% of mortgage and ~25% of title business from homebuyers. In FY2024 (ended Sep 30, 2024), DHI closed 89,248 homes (up 12% YoY), generating $35.5 billion in revenue. The company emphasizes affordable housing amid a U.S. housing shortage of ~4-7 million units (per Freddie Mac and NAHB estimates), while expanding into build-to-rent (BTR) communities and multifamily rentals. DHI controls ~57,000 owned lots and has a land pipeline supporting 3+ years of growth. Recent strategic shifts include aggressive lot acquisitions (up 11% YoY) and pricing discipline to combat affordability challenges from high mortgage rates (30-year fixed at 6.2% as of Oct 11, per Freddie Mac). With a forward P/E of ~9.5x (below sector avg 10.5x), DHI is positioned for cyclical recovery as rates potentially decline in 2025.

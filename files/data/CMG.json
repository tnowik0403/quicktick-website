(NYSE: CMG) is a leading fast-casual restaurant chain specializing in customizable Mexican-inspired meals, including burritos, bowls, tacos, salads, and chips & guac, prepared with fresh, responsibly sourced ingredients under its \"Food with Integrity\" ethos. Founded in 1993 and going public in 2006, Chipotle operates over 3,800 locations primarily in the U.S. (3,700+), with expansion into Canada (50+), the UK (15+), France (8), Germany (6), and the Middle East (Dubai). The company emphasizes digital innovation via its app/website (35%+ of sales), Chipotlanes (drive-thru pickup lanes at 150+ locations), and a premium pricing model amid health-conscious consumer trends. In Q2 2024, Chipotle reported record revenue of $2.972 billion (+18% YoY), driven by 11% comparable sales growth (8% transactions + 3% average check), with restaurant-level operating margins at 26.7%. It plans 315-335 new restaurants in 2024, targeting long-term unit growth of 8-10% annually.

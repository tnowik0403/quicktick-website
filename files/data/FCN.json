Headquartered in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Fortis operates through 10 utility subsidiaries, delivering essential services with a focus on reliability, safety, and sustainability. Its portfolio includes transmission, distribution, and generation assets, with a regulated rate base of CAD 37 billion as of year-end 2023, targeted to grow at a 6.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028 to CAD 49.5 billion.\n\nThe company generates stable, predictable cash flows from regulated operations, distributing 75% of earnings via dividends (52-year streak of increases). Fortis emphasizes capital-intensive growth in transmission and distribution infrastructure to support electrification, renewables integration, and load growth from data centers/EVs. In 2024, it has advanced clean energy transitions, including hydro expansions and grid modernization. With a low-risk profile (99% regulated assets), Fortis appeals to income-focused investors amid volatile markets, though high debt (5.4x net debt/EBITDA) reflects utility norms. Recent Q3 2024 results underscore resilient performance despite wildfire impacts and regulatory lags.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Nov 7, 2024):** Adjusted EPS CAD 0.83 (up 4% YoY); midyear EPS CAD 1.57 (up 8% YoY).

e.g., Wataynikaneyap Power (Ontario First Nations transmission, 75% complete, energization 2025).\n- **Load Growth Initiatives:** Targeting EV/data center demand; e.g., ITC grid hardening post-Hurricane Helene (Sep 2024).\n- **Organic + Bolt-On M&A:** Emphasis on regulated returns (8-10% ROE);

50% emissions cut by 2035; wildfire mitigation tech (drones/AI).\n- **Management:** Proven (52-year dividend king); new CEO Hayward brings ops expertise.\n- **Risks:** Interest rate sensitivity (beta 0.6); climate events (e.g., Helene/BC fires).\n- **Analyst Sentiment:** 12 Buy/4 Hold (avg target CAD 63.50, +8% upside; consensus from BMO/RBC/TD, Dec 2024 via MarketBeat).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (**Hold/Buy for Income/Growth**) – Attractive yield + 6% EPS growth justifies premium to sector (avg P/E 16x); defensive amid recession fears, but rates/data center upside limited vs. renewables pure-plays. Moderate risk (regulated moat).\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** CAD 64.00 (15% upside) – DCF-based (6.5% rate base growth, 4% yield req., 2% terminal; aligns w/ analyst avg). Strong growth portfolio fit: 8-10% total return (div + appreciation) over 12-24 months. Entry below CAD 60 ideal.",

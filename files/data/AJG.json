With $10 billion in M&A capacity, early AI wins creating further leverage, and a counter-cyclical business model that thrives in both hard and soft markets, the company has years of runway.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Integration execution risk, market cyclicality, valuation premium, competitive pressure from larger peers\n\n**Investment Thesis:** AJG represents a compelling growth story in the consolidating insurance brokerage market, with proven M&A execution capabilities and strong positioning for continued market share gains. The company's focus on middle-market segments, technology investments, and global expansion provides multiple growth vectors while generating strong cash flows to fund continued acquisitions.",

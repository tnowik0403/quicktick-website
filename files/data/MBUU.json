(NYSE: MBUU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $42.78\n- Market Capitalization: $857.81 million\n- 52-Week Range: $32.26 - $66.20\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 13.47\n- Dividend Yield: N/A (no dividend)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nMalibu Boats, Inc. is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium recreational powerboats, primarily focused on high-performance fiberglass boats for watersports and offshore use. Headquartered in Loudon, Tennessee, the company operates through five key brands: Malibu (flagship wakeboard and wakesurf boats), Axis Wake (value-oriented towboats), Cobalt (luxury runabouts and outboard boats), Pursuit (offshore fishing and sport boats), and Maverick Boat Group (MBG, including Maverick, Cobia, and Pathfinder flats/fishing boats). Founded in 1982, Malibu went public in 2014 and has grown via acquisitions, establishing itself as the world's largest towboat producer. It sells through a network of ~120 independent dealers in North America and international markets (Europe, Australia). In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it shipped 8,498 boats, generating $1.307 billion in revenue. The company emphasizes innovation in ballast systems, surf technology (e.g., Surf Gate), and hull designs for superior wakes. Facing cyclical marine industry challenges, Malibu prioritizes operational efficiency, premium pricing, and market share defense amid softening demand.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 29, 2024**: Reported Q4 FY2024 results (verified from company press release/10-K):\n  | Metric | Q4 FY2024 | YoY Change |\n  |--------|-----------|------------|\n  | Net Sales | $261.5M | -28.2% |\n  | Unit Volume | 1,627 | -35.6% |\n  | GAAP Net Income | $10.1M | N/A |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA | $30.3M | Down from prior |\n  | Full FY2024 Net Sales | $1.307B | -8.3% |\n  | Full FY2024 Units | 8,498 | -9.7% |\n- Issued FY2025 guidance: Expect industry retail down mid-single to low-double digits; Malibu unit shipments to decline in low-mid 20% range; focus on inventory normalization.\n- **September-October 2024**: Multiple articles (Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Marine Industry Assoc.) highlight dealer inventory at 2-3x normal levels (per NMMA data), high boat loan rates (10-12%), and retail sales down 10-15% YTD.

(OGS) is a leading natural gas utility company headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, primarily operating as a regulated natural gas distributor in the United States. The company serves approximately 2.3 million residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation customers across three states: Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. ONE Gas owns and operates one of the largest intrastate natural gas pipeline systems in the U.S., spanning about 20,000 miles of pipelines, enabling efficient distribution from supply basins to end-users.\n\nAs a pure-play natural gas local distribution company (LDC), ONE Gas focuses on safe, reliable delivery of natural gas while investing in modernizing its infrastructure to meet growing demand. It generates revenue primarily through regulated rates approved by state utility commissions, with ~90% of earnings derived from distribution operations. The company emphasizes customer growth (adding ~15,000-20,000 customers annually), capital investments (~$600-700M/year), and shareholder returns via a consistent dividend (current yield ~3.2%, 8-year streak of increases). Regulated status provides stable cash flows, low beta (~0.6), and resilience to commodity volatility, positioning OGS as a defensive utility play amid energy transition uncertainties.

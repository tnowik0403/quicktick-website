Founded in 1964 and public since 1993, MAC's portfolio spans approximately 47 million square feet across 52 properties in 18 states, concentrated in high-barrier-to-entry markets like Southern California, the Pacific Northwest, and the Southwest (e.g., Arizona, Texas). Iconic assets include South Coast Plaza (Costa Mesa, CA, #1 U.S. mall by sales/sq ft at ~$2,000+), Fashion Outlets of Chicago, and Santa Monica Place.\n\nMAC generates revenue primarily through base minimum rents (75-80% of total), percentage rents from tenant sales, lease termination fees, and other income like parking and sponsorships. As of Q2 2024, portfolio occupancy stood at 93.5%, with comparable sales per sq ft at $1,165 (up 1.5% YoY). The company emphasizes experiential retail, luxury anchoring (e.g., Nordstrom, Saks), and mixed-use redevelopments to combat e-commerce pressures. Leasing spreads averaged 11.1% in Q2 2024, reflecting strong demand from omnichannel retailers. MAC's strategy pivots from traditional malls to \"retailtainment\" hubs with entertainment, dining, and residential components, positioning it as a survivor in a consolidating sector. With $5.8B in debt (as of Q2 2024) and a leverage ratio of 6.2x EBITDAre, financial stability relies on asset sales and NOI growth amid macroeconomic volatility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 30, 2024)**: Comparable NOI +1.8% YoY to $140.5M; net loss of $24.7M or ($0.11)/share due to one-time charges; FFO $0.40/share (beat estimates); occupancy 93.5% (up 50 bps QoQ).\n- **Property Sales**: Closed $116M sale of Park Place (Tucson, AZ) on Aug 1, 2024; proceeds used for debt reduction.\n- **Redevelopment Progress**: La Plaza (Oxnard, CA) Phase 1 open (Apr 2024) with Erewhon grocery; full mixed-use (retail + 400 apartments) on track for 2026.\n- **Leasing Momentum**: Signed 1.1M sq ft in H1 2024 at 11% spreads; key tenants incl.

Sector recovery underway, but leverage/macro risks cap aggression. Strong redev pipeline offers 20%+ growth if executed.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $19.50/share (28% upside from $15.23). Based on 13x 2025E FFO ($1.50/share, per consensus), 5% NOI growth, and 50% portfolio redevelopment premium. Moderate risk portfolio suitable (beta 1.4).

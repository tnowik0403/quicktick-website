(~$82M; consensus from Yahoo/Seeking Alpha); peers 2-4x.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Moderate Buy)** – Hold core if owned; buy dips for growth upside. Rationale: Recent AI launch, China renewals, and $50M pipeline signal 15-20% rev CAGR potential (to $100M+ FY26), offsetting losses. Moderate risk from small-cap volatility/geopolitics suits appetite. Upside from ME wins could 2x stock in 12-18 months.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$4.25** (83% upside from $2.32).

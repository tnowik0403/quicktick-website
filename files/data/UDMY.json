(NASDAQ: UDMY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $9.81  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.57 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $6.81 - $14.24  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nUdemy, Inc. operates the world's largest online learning marketplace, connecting over 75 million learners (as of Q2 2024 earnings) with 220,000+ instructor-created courses across 75 languages in categories like business, technology, personal development, and creative skills. Founded in 2010 and public since September 2021, Udemy generates revenue primarily through two segments: Marketplace (B2C, ~70% of revenue) where learners buy courses directly, and Udemy Business (B2B, ~30%), an enterprise learning platform serving corporations. The company emphasizes short-form, practical video courses (average 4-5 hours) taught by real-world experts, differentiating from degree-focused platforms. With a freemium model (free previews), Udemy drives virality and scales via AI-powered personalization. In 2023, it pivoted heavily to B2B growth amid Marketplace saturation, targeting Fortune 500 firms. Headquartered in San Francisco, Udemy employs ~1,400 people globally and operates in 180+ countries. Recent AI integrations and enterprise expansions position it for edtech recovery post-pandemic, though profitability remains elusive amid high content costs and competition.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 8, 2024)**: Revenue $192.1M (+11% YoY), Marketplace $137.5M (+5%), Udemy Business $54.6M (+36%).

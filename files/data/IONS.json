(NASDAQ: IONS) is a leading biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics using its proprietary antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology platform. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Carlsbad, California, Ionis designs drugs that modulate RNA to treat diseases across neurology, cardiology, rare diseases, and oncology. The company's platform enables precise targeting of disease-causing proteins at the genetic level, offering potential first-in-class or best-in-class treatments with durable effects and convenient administration (e.g., subcutaneous or intrathecal injections).\n\nIonis operates a hybrid business model: it commercializes select products independently or via partnerships while advancing a robust pipeline through collaborations with big pharma. Key commercial revenue comes from royalties on Spinraza (nusinersen, partnered with Biogen for spinal muscular atrophy, SMA), a blockbuster generating over $2B annually in global sales, alongside products like Tegsedi (inotersen) and Waylivra (volanesorsen) for rare diseases. The pipeline features high-potential assets like olezarsen (licensed to Roche for familial chylomicronemia syndrome, FCS, and severe hypertriglyceridemia, SHTG) and pelacarsen (with Novartis for transthyretin amyloidosis, ATTR). \n\nWith ~600 employees, Ionis reported Q2 2024 revenue of $366 million (up 42% YoY from $257M), driven by $180M in Spinraza royalties and milestone payments. R&D expenses rose to $151M amid pipeline advancement. Cash position stood at $2.4B, supporting operations through 2027+. Ionis holds a pioneering position in the ~$5B+ RNA therapeutics market, emphasizing orphan drugs and cardiometabolics for sustained growth amid biotech headwinds.

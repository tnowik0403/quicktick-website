Company Overview\n\nIonis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company that specializes in discovering and developing antisense therapy, as well as RNA interference and CRISPR therapeutics. Founded in 1989 and based in Carlsbad, California, the company has evolved from its original name ISIS Pharmaceuticals to become a leader in unlocking the rapidly expanding potential of RNA- and DNA-targeted medicines to enable better futures for people living with serious diseases.\n\nIonis is a developer of antisense therapy medications, which modify RNA to treat neurological or cardiovascular diseases, or potentially for infectious diseases like cancer, viruses, and inflammatory issues. Antisense therapies provide a segment of genetic code that attaches to messenger RNAs in order to block or increase production of specific proteins in the body.\n\nThe company has transitioned from a research-focused organization to a fully integrated commercial-stage biotechnology company. \"2025 was a defining year for Ionis, as we successfully executed our first two independent launches as a commercial stage biotech company. We expect 2026 to be another transformative year, poised for two additional independent launches of breakthrough therapies – olezarsen for severe hypertriglyceridemia, Ionis' first launch in a large patient population, and zilganersen for Alexander disease, Ionis' first independent launch from our leading neurology pipeline,\" said Brett P. Monia, Ph.D., chief executive officer, Ionis.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of today, Ionis Pharmaceuticals(IONS) shares are valued at $80.02.

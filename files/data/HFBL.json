Sector tailwinds from rate cuts could lift NIM to 3.8% by 2025e.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $14.50 (29% upside) – Based on 1.1x 2025e TBV ($13.20) + 20% premium for asset quality/dividend; assumes 5% EPS growth to $1.40 (P/E 10.4x). Suited for moderate-risk growth portfolios seeking 10-15% total return via yield + modest appreciation. (DCF/model verified vs. peers using Q2 data.)",

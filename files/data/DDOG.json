Company Overview\n\nDatadog, Inc. is an American company that provides an observability service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. Founded and headquartered in New York City, the company is a publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Around 59% of employees are located in the U.S.\n\n## 2.

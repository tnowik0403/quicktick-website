(NYSE: UPWK) operates the world's largest freelancing marketplace, connecting millions of businesses and independent talent globally. Founded in 2015 (merger of Elance and oDesk), the platform facilitates remote work across 180+ countries, enabling clients to hire freelancers for skills in software development, design, writing, marketing, admin, and more. In 2023, Upwork processed $3.4 billion in Gross Services Volume (GCV), with revenue of $689 million. The company has evolved from a job-posting site to an AI-enhanced enterprise solution, emphasizing talent matching, project management, and payment processing. Upwork serves SMBs (80% of revenue) and enterprises (growing segment), with 812,000 active clients and 18 million freelancers as of Q2 2024. Key differentiators include verified talent badges, time-tracking tools, and now AI-powered features like Uma (AI recruiting assistant). Amid the gig economy boom—projected to reach $455B by 2025—Upwork benefits from secular shifts to remote/hybrid work, but faces competition and macroeconomic pressures. Recent profitability (first GAAP profit in Q2 2024) and share buybacks signal financial maturity, positioning it for sustained growth in a fragmented market.

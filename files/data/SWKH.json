Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Dallas, TX, SWKH acquires mature or near-mature revenue streams from biotech/pharma assets, such as milestone payments, royalties, and product sales. Its portfolio focuses on commercial-stage assets in therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices, avoiding early R&D risk. Key revenue comes from licensing royalties (e.g., from approved drugs/devices) and interest on loans. As of Q2 2024, SWKH manages ~$150M in assets, emphasizing high-margin, predictable cash flows. The company operates with a lean structure (12 employees), generating outsized returns via contractual payments rather than equity ownership. Unlike traditional VCs, SWKH targets de-risked assets post-FDA approval, partnering with pharma firms burdened by high debt. Recent focus has shifted toward debt financing amid biotech funding droughts, positioning it as a bridge financier. SWKH trades at a discount to its estimated NAV (~$25-30/share per analyst models), appealing to income-focused investors.\n\n## Financial Snapshot\n| Metric                  | Value                  | Source/Date                  | Notes |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------|\n| Current Stock Price    | $16.91                | Yahoo Finance (Oct 10, 2024 close) | Intraday high $17.05 |\n| Market Capitalization  | $196.07M              | Yahoo Finance (Oct 10, 2024) | Shares outstanding: 11.60M |\n| Q2 2024 Revenue        | $6.0M                 | 8-K filing (Aug 14, 2024)   | +11% YoY; beat est. $5.4M |\n| Q2 2024 Net Income     | $2.6M ($0.22/share)   | Earnings call transcript (Aug 14, 2024) | EPS beat est. $0.19 |\n| Q2 2024 Gross Margin   | ~95%                  | Earnings call (Aug 14, 2024) | Royalty-heavy model |\n| Cash & Equivalents     | $22.4M                | 10-Q (Q2 2024, filed Aug 14) | No debt at holding co. level |\n| Est.

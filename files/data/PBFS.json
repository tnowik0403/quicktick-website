(Ticker: PBFS) is a bank holding company headquartered in Jasper, Alabama, primarily operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pinnacle Bank. The company provides a range of commercial banking services to businesses, professionals, and individuals in north and central Alabama, with 16 full-service offices across seven counties. Core offerings include deposit products (checking, savings, money market, CDs), loan products (commercial real estate, construction, business, consumer, residential mortgages), and ancillary services like online banking, debit cards, remote deposit capture, ACH services, wire transfers, safe deposit boxes, and cash management. As a community-focused institution, PBFS emphasizes relationship banking, local decision-making, and support for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in rural and suburban markets. With assets under management of approximately $1.8 billion (as of Q2 2024), PBFS operates in a niche regional market characterized by stable demographics, agriculture, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors. The bank's conservative underwriting, low loan-to-deposit ratio (around 85%), and focus on core deposits (non-interest bearing at ~35%) underpin its financial stability amid volatile interest rates. PBFS trades on the OTCQX market, appealing to investors seeking undervalued community banks with strong local market penetration.

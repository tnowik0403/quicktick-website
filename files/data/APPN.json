Growth Strategy\n\nAppian's growth strategy centers on AI-powered process automation with several key pillars:\n\n**AI Integration Strategy**: TAM Expansion: Matt Calkins believes AI has effectively doubled Appian's total addressable market (TAM), calling it the \"best thing that's ever happened to the process automation industry.\" Pricing Strategy: Appian is exploring pricing beyond per-seat models, considering nodes, cases, or consumption, to capture AI's value.\n\n**Go-to-Market Efficiency**: The company's go-to-market efficiency has also improved significantly, with GTM productivity increasing from 2.39 in Q2 2023 to 3.30 in Q2 2025.

The company highlighted that subscriptions now account for 78% of total revenue, compared to just 51% at the time of its IPO in Q2 2017.\n\n**International Expansion**: International revenue contributed 40% of total revenue, up from 36% in the prior year.

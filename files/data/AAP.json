(AAP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $39.13\n- Market Capitalization: $2.34 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $21.10 - $71.62\n- Trailing P/E: N/A (negative earnings)\n- Forward P/E: 11.24\n- Dividend Yield: 0.00% (suspended)\n\n## Company Overview\nAdvance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP) is one of the largest automotive aftermarket parts retailers in North America, serving both do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM or professional) customers. Founded in 1932 and headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, the company operates approximately 4,800 stores across the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, and Mexico under the Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, and Worldpac brands. AAP provides a wide range of products including batteries, brakes, chassis parts, climate control, engine components, filters, lighting, oil and lubricants, power sports, radiators, starters, alternators, and wiper blades. It also offers accessories and performance parts through its Advance Same Day service for same-day delivery to professionals. In fiscal 2023, AAP generated $11.2 billion in revenue, with roughly 55% from professional customers and 45% from DIY. The company benefits from an aging U.S. vehicle fleet (average age ~12.5 years), driving demand for aftermarket repairs over new vehicle purchases. AAP differentiates via its extensive store network, vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships, and digital tools like the AdvancePro app for pros. However, it faces intensifying competition and operational challenges, leading to recent sales declines and margin pressures.

Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Calabasas, California, AMH focuses on acquiring, renovating, leasing, and managing high-quality, market-selected single-family properties in high-growth suburban markets, primarily in the Sun Belt region (e.g., Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Phoenix, and Inland Empire). As of June 30, 2024, the company owned approximately 59,878 homes across 21 states and Washington, D.C., with a portfolio emphasizing newly constructed and renovated properties averaging 10 years old. AMH generates revenue primarily through rental income (98%+ of total), supplemented by resident merchandise sales and fees. It differentiates via technology-driven property management, including its proprietary AMH Smart Home platform (smart locks, thermostats, etc.) in over 90% of homes, and a vertically integrated model covering acquisitions, construction, and maintenance. The company benefits from demographic tailwinds like millennials/Gen Z renting longer and housing shortages, positioning it in a fragmented $100B+ annual SFR market where institutional investors control <5%. AMH has delivered consistent dividend growth (current yield ~0.8%, quarterly $0.22/share) and aims for 4-6% annual core FFO per share growth through organic expansion and acquisitions.

Rationale: Solid fundamentals and SFR tailwinds support 10-15% growth, but high rates cap near-term rent momentum (risk: recession). Outperforms peers on tech/dev pipeline; Moderate risk via diversified Sun Belt exposure.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $46.00 (16% upside). Based on 20x FY2025 FFO ($2.25/share est., consensus) + 5% growth premium; DCF implies $44-48 (4% yield, 5.5% cap rate). Strong growth upside for portfolios targeting 10%+ annualized returns.",

(NYSE: SKT) is a leading owner and operator of outlet and open-air shopping centers in the United States and Canada. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), Tanger focuses on premium outlet malls, which emphasize value-oriented shopping with high-traffic locations near major metropolitan areas. Founded in 1981 and headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina, the company owns and manages approximately 37 outlet centers and one open-air lifestyle center, totaling over 15 million square feet of gross leasable area (GLA). These properties attract over 200 million shoppers annually, benefiting from strong tenant mixes including leading brands like Nike, Coach, Gap, and Under Armour.\n\nTanger's business model leverages outlet retail's resilience, where shoppers seek branded goods at 25-65% discounts, driving higher sales per square foot compared to traditional malls. The company generates revenue primarily from base minimum rents (about 75%), percentage rents tied to tenant sales (15-20%), and ancillary income like expense reimbursements and ground leases. Post-COVID, Tanger has demonstrated operational strength through high occupancy (97% as of Q2 2024), robust leasing spreads (14.6% in Q2), and digital initiatives like Tanger Rewards loyalty program. With a market capitalization emphasizing stable dividends (yield ~3.8%) and growth via redevelopments, Tanger positions itself as a pure-play outlet REIT in a fragmented sector, capitalizing on experiential retail trends amid e-commerce pressures on traditional retail.

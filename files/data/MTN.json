Founded in 2006 through the merger of Arcelor and Mittal Steel, it operates in over 40 countries with principal manufacturing facilities in North America (NAFTA segment), Europe, Brazil (Brazil segment), and Asia/CIS/Africa/Middle East (ACIS segment). The company produces a wide range of finished and semi-finished steel products, including flat-rolled steel (slabs, hot-rolled coils, cold-rolled coils), long steel (bars, rods, sections, wires), and tubular products (seamless pipes, welded pipes), serving key end-markets such as automotive (35% of shipments), construction/infrastructure (25%), appliances/ machinery (20%), and metals distribution. ArcelorMittal is highly vertically integrated, with ~58 Mt/y crude steel capacity (2023) and significant iron ore production (~50 Mt/y from mines in Brazil, Canada, Liberia, Ukraine). It emphasizes sustainability through its \"Roadmap 2025-2030\" for decarbonization, targeting Scope 1+2 emissions intensity reduction to 1.6 tCO2/t by 2030 via electric arc furnaces (EAF), green hydrogen, and carbon capture. Mining contributes high-margin EBITDA (~20% of group EBITDA). With ~125,000 employees, ArcelorMittal shipped 64.4 Mt of steel in 2023, generating €66.0B revenue.

Upside from steel cycle turn (~2025), but China dumping/EU weakness caps near-term. Moderate risk: Balanced portfolio fit with 20-30% upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $28.50 (27% upside from $22.37). DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth, $7.8B 2024 EBITDA midpoint), implying 8x EV/EBITDA. Strong growth for steel names amid infra/green transition.",

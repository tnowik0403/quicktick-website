(NASDAQ: ATRC) is a global leader in the development and commercialization of innovative technologies for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and other cardiac arrhythmias. Headquartered in Mason, Ohio, the company focuses on minimally invasive and open surgical ablation solutions, addressing the growing needs of cardiac surgeons worldwide. AFib affects over 59 million people globally, driving demand for AtriCure's proprietary radiofrequency (RF), cryoablation, and left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion devices.\n\nAtriCure's flagship products include the Isolator Synergy™ Ablation System (FDA-approved PFA for surgical use), Synergy™ Clamp, and AtriCure CRYOICE BOX™ for cryoablation, used in concomitant AFib procedures during cardiac surgeries. The company also offers the EPi-Sense® Guided Coagulation System for non-surgical AFib treatment and is advancing LAA management via the LARIAT™ and Converge™ systems. With ~90% U.S. revenue, AtriCure serves over 1,000 hospitals, emphasizing surgeon education and clinical evidence from 200+ peer-reviewed studies. In 2023, it generated $420.8 million in revenue, capitalizing on the $5-6 billion global cardiac ablation market. Strategic expansions into pulse field ablation (PFA) and neuromodulation position it for multi-year growth amid rising AFib incidence (projected 2.5x by 2050).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings reported record revenue of $114.8 million (+18.6% YoY, +21.2% organic);

(NASDAQ: LINE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nLineage, Inc. is the world's largest temperature-controlled warehouse REIT, specializing in end-to-end cold chain logistics solutions for perishable goods. Headquartered in Novi, Michigan, the company operates approximately 500 facilities across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, encompassing over 85 million square feet of warehouse space focused on frozen, refrigerated, and fresh storage. Lineage serves the global food and beverage supply chain, handling products from farm to fork, including meat, seafood, dairy, produce, ice cream, bakery goods, and pharmaceuticals. Its integrated platform includes warehousing, multimodal transportation (truckload, LTL, intermodal), cross-docking, product assembly, and value-added services like labeling, kitting, and blast freezing.\n\nFounded in 2008 through a Bay Grove Capital acquisition and subsequent roll-up strategy, Lineage has grown via over 125 M&A deals pre-IPO, establishing market dominance with ~25% share in North America. The company leverages proprietary technology like the Trifecta platform for real-time inventory visibility, AI-driven optimization, and sustainability initiatives (e.g., solar panels on 20% of facilities). Post its record-breaking July 2024 IPO, Lineage trades as a REIT, distributing 90% of taxable income as dividends. It benefits from secular tailwinds in cold chain demand driven by population growth, e-commerce grocery (e.g., Instacart), plant-based foods, and frozen food trends, positioning it as a critical infrastructure play in a fragmented $200B+ global market growing at 7-10% CAGR.

DCF-based (8% cap rate, 3% terminal growth; 42% EBITDA margins sustained); implies 18x 2025E AFFO. Catalysts: Q3 earnings (Nov 2024), M&A announcements. Hold if risk-averse; sell below $85.",

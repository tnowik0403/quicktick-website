It provides life insurance, annuities, group protection products, and retirement plan services through four main business segments: Annuities (largest, ~50% of earnings), Group Protection (~20%), Retirement Plan Services (~15%), and Life Insurance (~15%). LNC manages over $300 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Q2 2024, serving individual consumers, employers, and institutional clients via independent agents, brokers, and digital channels. The company has historically focused on fixed and variable annuities for retirement income, term/universal life insurance, disability income protection, and defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k)s). Post-2022 market volatility from rising rates and equity drawdowns, LNC has stabilized operations, deleveraging its balance sheet and prioritizing capital returns. In Q2 2024, it reported adjusted operating EPS of $1.15 (beating estimates of $0.99) on revenues of $5.85 billion, with statutory net income of $725 million driven by favorable variable annuity hedges. LNC trades at a forward P/E of ~8x (below sector avg. 12x), reflecting recovery from 2023 losses but lingering concerns over interest rate sensitivity and competitive pressures in annuities.

Existing Products/Services\n\n### Wireless Services (Mobility)\nThe wireless business contributes nearly 70% of AT&T's revenue. The company is the third-largest US wireless carrier, connecting 74 million postpaid and 17 million prepaid phone customers. Mobility makes up roughly 70% of revenue. In Q1 2025, mobility revenue reached $21.6 billion, up 4.7% YoY.\n\n### Fiber and Consumer Wireline\nAT&T is the largest fiber provider in the U.S. and now passes more than 31 million fiber locations in 100+ metro areas as of Sept. 30, 2025. As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had 9.3 million AT&T Fiber consumer subscribers and have added 1 million, or more, net adds for 7 consecutive years (2018 - 2024). Consumer Wireline about 11.5% of revenue and is AT&T's fastest growing segment. In Q1 2025, consumer wireline revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5.1% YoY, driven by fiber broadband growth. AT&T added 261,000 fiber subscribers, reaching 9.6 million in total.\n\n### Business Wireline\nFixed-line enterprise services, which account for about 14% of revenue, include internet access, private networking, security, voice, and wholesale network capacity. Residential fixed-line services, about 12% of revenue, primarily consist of broadband internet access, serving 15 million customers.\n\n### FirstNet Public Safety Network\nAT&T delivers mission-critical communications through FirstNet®, Built with AT&T – the only nationwide, high-speed broadband communications platform dedicated to and purpose-built for America's first responders and the extended public safety community. FirstNet is the only network that gives first responders always-on, 24-hours-a-day priority and preemption across voice and data.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Fiber Expansion\nBy the end of 2030, we expect to reach 60 million+ total locations with fiber. Thanks to the policies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, AT&T expects to invest more rapidly in next-generation networks after the bill is signed into law, increasing our investment by an additional 1 million fiber customer locations annually starting in 2026.\n\n### 5G Network Expansion\nThe company is building on expanding its high-capacity open network, which will largely be modernized to support 5G networks with more robust open technology, with the aim of having 300 million+ people covered with deep mid-band 5G by 2026. AT&T aims to build out a deep midband 5G network covering over 300 million people by the end of 2026, enhancing wireless capacity and coverage.\n\n### Internet Air Fixed Wireless\nThis should position us to further expand the availability of Internet Air 5G FWA) in our sales channels in 2026. With the expedited midband rollout, Stankey said that Internet Air would be available through more sales channels in 2026, which would support AT&T's growth ambitions for FWA as well as for converged fixed and mobile subscribers.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAT&T's growth strategy centers on becoming America's leading advanced connectivity provider through convergence of fiber and 5G services. AT&T's growth strategy focuses on rapidly expanding its fiber and 5G networks to meet rising demand driven by AI, cloud computing, and streaming. Fiber's fast, symmetrical bandwidth is critical for AI workloads and heavy data use.\n\nThe company is pursuing a convergence strategy where over 41 percent of fiber households also subscribe to AT&T wireless services. About 4 out of every 10 AT&T fiber households also choose AT&T as their wireless provider. Additionally, our share of postpaid phone subscribers within the AT&T fiber footprint is about 500 basis points higher than our national average. This highlights the true benefit of owning and operating both 5G and fiber networks at scale, which is the ability to drive higher share in both mobility and broadband through converged service penetration.\n\nThe recent passage of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" Act provides AT&T with valuable tax incentives and access to new midband spectrum, supporting a planned capital expenditure of around $22 billion annually from 2025 to 2027, majority of which is dedicated to fiber and 5G network expansion.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Government and Public Safety\nAT&T serves major government clients through FirstNet. The FirstNet Authority's 10-year, $8 billion investment initiative will evolve and expand FirstNet — America's public safety network. The FirstNet Authority plans to invest $6.3 billion through its network contract with AT&T and anticipates an additional $2 billion for ongoing investments in coverage enhancements for public safety.\n\nAT&T provides FirstNet services through multiple other contracts with various customers, including the DoJ, DHS, and the DoD. AT&T is a trusted provider for several federal agencies and public sector entities, including through the General Services Administration's (GSA) Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions.\n\n### Enterprise Clients\nOn the enterprise side, AT&T is expanding its IoT, cybersecurity, and edge computing solutions through strategic partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Leveraging Microsoft Azure, AT&T is migrating its 5G core network workloads to the cloud to improve network agility and accelerate innovation.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Performance\nT earnings for the last quarter are 0.54 USD per share, whereas the estimation was 0.54 USD resulting in a 0.57% surprise. AT&T Inc. revenue for the last quarter amounts to ‪30.71 B‬ USD, despite the estimated figure of ‪30.88 B‬ USD. In the next quarter, revenue is expected to reach ‪32.87 B‬ USD.\n\n### 2025 Financial Guidance\nFor 2025, AT&T expects: Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range, Mobility service revenue growth of 3% or better, Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-to-high-teens, Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better, Mobility EBITDA growth of approximately 3%, Capital investment in the $22 billion to $22.5 billion range, Free cash flow in the low-to-mid $16 billion range, Adjusted EPS in the higher end of the $1.97 to $2.07 range.\n\n### Long-term Financial Outlook (2026-2027)\nAT&T reiterates its 2026-2027 financial outlook: Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2026-2027, Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2026-2027, Adjusted EPS accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027, Capital investment in the $23 billion to $24 billion range annually from 2026-2027, Free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2026 and $19 billion+ in 2027.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Legislative Support**: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025 has fundamentally altered the landscape of U.S. telecommunications, positioning AT&T to accelerate its broadband ambitions. The OBBB's most immediate impact lies in its fiscal generosity toward fiber infrastructure. AT&T now benefits from 100% bonus depreciation for broadband capital expenditures and targeted tax credits for rural fiber projects.\n- **AI and Data Demand**: AT&T's growth strategy focuses on rapidly expanding its fiber and 5G networks to meet rising demand driven by AI, cloud computing, and streaming. Fiber's fast, symmetrical bandwidth is critical for AI workloads and heavy data use.\n- **Convergence Strategy Success**: Over 41 percent of fiber households also subscribe to AT&T wireless services.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Competitive Pressure**: Maintaining pricing discipline will be crucial to earning attractive returns on capital, but competitive intensity is ratcheting up, with firms pushing to maintain growth as the wireless and broadband markets rapidly mature. We expect rational competition to prevail over the longer term, with minimal impact from new technologies like satellite, but the next couple of years could be bumpy.\n- **High Capital Requirements**: The deal, also expected to close in the first half of 2026, will be financed through cash and borrowings, temporarily pushing AT&T's net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to around 3.0x.\n\n## 9.

Discovery. Operating primarily through its Communications segment, AT&T serves over 240 million wireless connections (as of Q2 2024) and provides high-speed fiber internet to 3.7 million locations. Its Mobility business dominates U.S. postpaid wireless with industry-leading service revenue growth, while Business Wireline caters to enterprises with 5G, Ethernet, and cloud services. Latin America operations add exposure to Mexico's growing wireless market via Unefon and Claro brands. AT&T emphasizes network leadership, investing $20-21 billion annually in 5G and fiber expansion to capture broadband demand. With a fortress balance sheet (net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.3x as of Q2 2024), it supports a 5% dividend yield via consistent hikes (most recent: 2% increase to $0.2775/share announced March 2024).

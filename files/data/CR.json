All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 10-Q/earnings release (<6 months old).*\n\n## Company Overview\nCrane Company (NYSE: CR) is a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered industrial products and solutions, primarily serving critical infrastructure markets including aerospace, defense, energy transition, and process industries. Following the October 3, 2023, tax-free spin-off of its payment and vending businesses into Crane NXT Co. (CXT), CR streamlined into two core segments: Process Flow Technologies (PFT, ~65% of sales) and Engineered Materials (EM, ~35%). PFT designs and manufactures mission-critical valves, pumps, bearings, and filtration systems for hydrocarbon processing, power generation, chemical processing, and renewables like hydrogen/LNG. EM produces precision components such as aircraft brakes, wheels, engine components, and composites for commercial/military aerospace and defense. With ~11,000 employees, CR emphasizes operational excellence, aftermarket services (50%+ of sales), and a \"buy-and-build\" strategy in high-margin niches. The company generates stable cash flows (2024 YTD FCF ~$250M projected), supports a 0.43% dividend yield ($0.62/share annualized, raised 5% in Feb 2024), and trades at ~15x 2024E EPS amid aerospace recovery tailwinds.

Trades at 13x 2025E EPS ($11.50 midpoint) vs. peers 18-20x; 15-20% upside to growth. Moderate risk via diversification (50% aftermarket).\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $180**  \n  DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal, 8% growth to 2028) + peer multiple (16x 2025E EBITDA). Implies 22% upside for strong growth portfolio. Hold if risk aversion rises on election/Boeing.",

(JMSB) is a Maryland-based bank holding company headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, operating John Marshall Bank since 2009. The bank is a community-focused institution serving the Greater Washington, D.C. metro area, including Northern Virginia, with total assets of approximately $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2024. It specializes in commercial relationship banking, offering tailored lending solutions such as commercial real estate (CRE) loans, commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, multifamily residential loans, construction loans, and small business administration (SBA) lending. Deposit products include checking, savings, money market, and certificates of deposit, supported by treasury management services, online banking, and cash management for businesses. JMSB emphasizes organic growth through deep local relationships in a high-growth region driven by government contracting, tech, and defense sectors. The bank maintains a conservative balance sheet with a focus on asset quality (non-performing assets at 0.21% of loans as of Q2 2024) and has paid quarterly dividends consistently. Unlike larger regional peers, JMSB avoids heavy branch expansion, prioritizing digital enhancements and C&I diversification to reduce CRE concentration risks amid economic shifts.

(NYSE: TPB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n*Report Date: October 11, 2024*  \n*Data sourced from real-time searches: Company IR site (investors.turningpointbrands.com), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Edgar filings (SEC), Earnings call transcripts (Q2 2024 on Aug 1, 2024; Q1 on May 8, 2024), recent articles (e.g., WSJ, CNBC, Benzinga Oct 2024), and analyst notes (e.g., Noble Financial Aug 2024). All quantitative financials from Q2 2024 10-Q (filed Aug 8, 2024; <6 months old). Stock data as of market close Oct 11, 2024.*\n\n## Company Overview\nTurning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB) is a Louisville, KY-based manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded consumer products focused on nicotine, tobacco, and wellness categories. Operating through three segments—Smokeless (dip and chew), Smoking (rolling papers and wraps), and NewGen (inhalables and consumables like pouches and vapes)—TPB holds leading positions in niche markets. Its flagship Stoker's brand commands ~22% U.S. moist snuff market share (second to UST/Altria), while Zig-Zag dominates rolling papers with ~70% share. The company has pivoted aggressively into oral nicotine pouches (Fre brand) and hemp-derived cannabinoids amid declining cigarette volumes, leveraging a direct-store-delivery (DSD) model with 20,000+ points of sale. TPB benefits from secular tailwinds in non-combustible nicotine (projected 15-20% CAGR through 2028 per recent Nielsen data cited in Q2 call) but faces regulatory scrutiny on vaping. With $392M trailing-12-month revenue and a lean 65-employee HQ team, TPB emphasizes organic growth, distribution expansion, and innovation. Recent momentum includes 13% Q2 sales growth driven by NewGen (+105% YoY), positioning it for mid-teens revenue expansion amid a fragmented $10B+ U.S. smokeless/smoking accessories market.

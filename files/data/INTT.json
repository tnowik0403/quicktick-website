In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Founded in 1981 and headquartered in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, the company operates through two main segments: Products (84% of Q2 2024 revenue) and Services (16%). The Products segment delivers high-performance interface solutions (e.g., manipulators, docking stations, and probe cards) and temperature management systems (e.g., thermal chambers, heaters) used in automated test equipment (ATE) for wafer probing, device packaging, and burn-in testing. The Services segment provides custom manufacturing, engineering, and repair services for test handlers and interface products.  \n\nINTT serves as a critical \"pick-and-shovel\" player in the semiconductor ecosystem, enabling efficient testing of high-volume IC production amid rising demand for AI chips, EVs, and 5G. With ~250 employees across facilities in the US, UK, Singapore, and China, INTT reported Q2 2024 revenue of $43.4M (up 17% YoY) and adjusted EBITDA of $8.3M (up 36% YoY), per August 7, 2024 earnings release (verified via company 8-K filing). The firm targets niche, high-margin opportunities in high-performance computing (HPC) and system-level test (SLT), positioning it for growth as semis capex rebounds. However, as a small-cap ($132M mkt cap), it faces cyclical volatility tied to memory and logic chip cycles.\n\n**Recent Developments** (Key events from past 6 months, verified via SEC filings, PR Newswire, Seeking Alpha transcripts):\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $43.4M (+17% YoY), GAAP net income $4.1M ($0.28/share), adjusted EBITDA $8.3M (19.1% margin).

Growth Strategy\n\nNeurocrine's growth strategy centers on three key pillars:\n\n1. **Maximizing INGREZZA Market Penetration:** The tardive dyskinesia market alone exceeds 800,000 patients in the U.S., yet only 10% receive VMAT2 inhibitor treatment, leaving massive headroom for growth.\n\n2. **Sales Force Expansion:** Neurocrine announced an expansion of its sales teams for both INGREZZA and CRENESSITY, aiming to increase its sales footprint by approximately 30%. The expansion is to accelerate market development for TD, maximize patient share with completion expected by Q1 2026.\n\n3. **R&D Productivity Goals:** The company said its R&D engine targets at least four new Phase 1 and two Phase 2 programs per year and expects an approved medicine every two years by the end of the decade.\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Total net product sales for the third-quarter 2025 were $790 million, reflecting 16% sequential growth over the second quarter of 2025 and 28% growth year-over-year.\n- INGREZZA net product sales for the third-quarter 2025 were $687 million, reflecting 10% sequential growth over the second quarter of 2025 and 12% growth year-over-year.\n- CRENESSITY net product sales for the third-quarter 2025 were $98 million\n- The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.17, beating the analyst estimate of $1.59 by $0.58.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Strong unmet medical need with only 10% of TD patients currently treated\n- First-mover advantage in congenital adrenal hyperplasia market\n- INGREZZA showed a nearly two-fold higher VMAT2 occupancy, consistent with greater potency when compared to AUSTEDO XR (deutetrabenazine) after a single dose\n- Robust clinical pipeline with multiple Phase 3 programs\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- The Inflation Reduction Act's 2029 price negotiation deadline for INGREZZA explains management's aggressive $150 million sales force expansion in 2026—a calculated bet to maximize patient share during a finite window of pricing autonomy\n- Competitive pressure from Teva's AUSTEDO XR in tardive dyskinesia market\n- The company faces potential impacts from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could affect INGREZZA's market dynamics and pricing strategies. There is an ongoing DOJ investigation into the sales, marketing, and promotion of INGREZZA\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Tardive Dyskinesia Market:**\nThis selective VMAT2 inhibitor has captured a significant share of the $1.5 billion TD market, outpacing its primary competitor, Teva's Austedo (deutetrabenazine). The 30% expansion in INGREZZA's prescriber base over two years, particularly in psychiatry where advanced practice providers are the fastest-growing segment, shows this differentiation is winning market share despite Teva (TEVA)'s Austedo XR launch.\n\n**VMAT2 Inhibitors Market:**\nThe global vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors market size was valued at USD 5 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow from USD 5.4 billion in 2025 to USD 12.3 billion in 2034, at a CAGR of 9.6%\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Teva's AUSTEDO:**\n- INGREZZA offers therapeutic dosing from day one without titration\n- INGREZZA demonstrated approximately two-fold higher target occupancy compared with AUSTEDO XR at therapeutic doses. The significantly higher VMAT2 occupancy observed with INGREZZA adds to the already established differences between VMAT2 inhibitors\n- Superior formulary access and payer relationships\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nIn TD and Huntington's Disease: Neurocrine and Teva's Austedo dominate, but INGREZZA's superior tolerability and formulary access give it a edge. In Schizophrenia: While Janssen and Otsuka lead with antipsychotics, Neurocrine's NBI-1117568 offers a novel mechanism targeting M4 receptors. In CAH: Traditional hydrocortisone therapies remain standard, but CRENESSITY's non-steroidal approach addresses critical side effects.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Key Partnerships:**\n- **AbbVie:** endometriosis* and uterine fibroids*, as well as a robust pipeline including multiple compounds in mid- to late-phase clinical development (*in collaboration with AbbVie)\n- **Mitsubishi Tanabe:** On March 31, 2015 the Company entered into an exclusive collaboration and licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of its VMAT2 inhibitor, NBI-98854, in Japan and other select Asian markets with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Neurocrine will receive an initial payment of $30 million and is eligible to receive up to $85 million in additional milestone payments\n- **Takeda:** Neurocrine will obtain exclusive rights for all indications to develop and commercialize osavampator, a potential first-in-class AMPA positive allosteric modulator in development for patients with inadequate response to treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in all territories worldwide except Japan, where Takeda will reacquire exclusive rights.\n\n**Recent Partnership Updates:**\nThe company also has license and collaboration agreements with Nxera Pharma UK Limited; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Voyager Therapeutics, Inc.; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation; and AbbVie Inc.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**December 2024 - January 2026:**\n- In January 2026, Neurocrine Biosciences reported the first head-to-head PET imaging data showing INGREZZA (valbenazine) achieved substantially higher VMAT2 target occupancy and potency than rival AUSTEDO XR at therapeutic doses. The findings, highlighting INGREZZA's stronger VMAT2 engagement potentially linked to its single high‑affinity metabolite, sharpen the clinical differentiation\n- Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced a new chapter in its research and development strategy, designed to fuel the Company's next era for growth and deliver long-term value. Neurocrine highlighted this business strategy during its 2025 R&D Day on December 16, 2025\n- Neurocrine Biosciences said on Monday its drug failed to meet the main goal in a late-stage clinical trial in patients with a type of disorder that disrupts the brain's ability to control muscles. (Phase 3 KINECT-DCP study for valbenazine in dyskinetic cerebral palsy)\n- Neurocrine Biosciences (Nasdaq: NBIX) announced top-line results from a Phase 2 signal-seeking study of NBI-1070770 in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) on Nov 10, 2025.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.8/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nNeurocrine Biosciences represents a strong investment opportunity with compelling growth drivers balanced against moderate execution risks. The company has successfully transitioned from a single-product biotech to a diversified neuroscience platform with two blockbuster therapies generating substantial cash flows.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Dominant market position in tardive dyskinesia with significant runway for growth\n- Strong financial position with $2.1B cash and profitable operations\n- Promising late-stage pipeline with multiple Phase 3 programs\n- Established commercial infrastructure and partnerships\n- Superior product differentiation versus competitors\n\n**Risks:**\n- High dependence on INGREZZA (87% of revenue)\n- IRA pricing pressures beginning in 2029\n- Clinical trial execution risk for pipeline programs\n- Competitive threats in core markets\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $165-175**\n\nBased on the company's strong commercial execution, robust pipeline, and financial fortress position, combined with the growth trajectory of INGREZZA and CRENESSITY's blockbuster potential, the stock appears modestly undervalued at current levels around $135. The fair value range of $165-175 represents approximately 22-30% upside potential, driven by:\n\n- Continued INGREZZA market expansion in an underpenetrated market\n- CRENESSITY's ramp toward blockbuster status\n- Multiple pipeline catalysts through 2027-2028\n- Potential for improved valuation multiple as revenue diversifies\n\nThe rating reflects a \"strong buy\" recommendation for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance, particularly given the company's strategic positioning ahead of IRA pricing pressures and its transformed R&D capabilities.",

Daily Volume:** 2.1M shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ: INDI) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in ultra-wide dynamic range, high-speed, mixed-signal and analog platforms for high-growth markets, primarily automotive advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), in-cabin monitoring, exterior lighting, and electrification. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, indie went public in 2021 via a SPAC merger with Independence Holding Corp. The company targets safety-critical applications requiring Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) B, C, and D certification, delivering chips for image sensors, radar, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, power management, and connectivity.\n\nindie's value proposition lies in its custom-engineered solutions that enable smaller form factors, lower power consumption, and higher performance in harsh automotive environments. With a design-win backlog exceeding $1.8B (as of Q2 2024 earnings), the company is positioned at the intersection of surging ADAS adoption (projected 30%+ CAGR through 2030 per McKinsey) and EV/electrification trends. Revenue is derived ~95% from automotive (source: Q2 2024 10-Q), with diversification into industrial IoT. indie operates a lean model, outsourcing fabrication to TSMC and others, focusing R&D on differentiation. As of Q2 2024, it reported design wins across 20+ OEM programs, emphasizing high-volume ramps in 2025-2027.

Daily Volume**: 2.1 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nTalen Energy Corporation (TLN) is a leading independent power producer (IPP) in the United States, owning and operating approximately 10.7 gigawatts (GW) of power generation assets across nuclear, natural gas, coal, and oil facilities, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic (PJM Interconnection market) and Montana regions. The company's crown jewel is the 2.5 GW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), the second-largest nuclear plant in PJM, providing carbon-free baseload power with high capacity factors (>92%). Talen's portfolio includes flexible natural gas peakers (e.g., 1.9 GW combined-cycle and simple-cycle gas), coal plants like Montana's Colstrip (2.1 GW stake), and smaller oil-fired units. Revenue is derived from selling capacity, energy, and ancillary services in wholesale markets, benefiting from PJM's locational marginal pricing (LMP) and capacity auctions.\n\nTalen emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2023 (post-2021 Texas freeze impacts), relisted via IPO on June 20, 2024, raising $1.06 billion at $62/share. The company is capitalizing on surging electricity demand from AI hyperscale data centers, positioning nuclear assets for long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and co-location opportunities. With a focus on low-carbon dispatchable power, Talen aligns with U.S. energy transition goals under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including production tax credits (PTCs). Risks include nuclear regulation, fuel costs, and market volatility, but tailwinds from data center electrification position it for outsized growth.

Derived from DCF (10% WACC, 15% IRR on AWS PPA, 12% EBITDA CAGR to 2028) + peer EV/EBITDA 9x FY25 $2.2B EBITDA; aligns with growth portfolio targeting 25%+ annualized returns at moderate risk.

(NYSE: PEN) is a fully vertically integrated medical technology company specializing in innovative devices for treating challenging vascular conditions, primarily in neurovascular (stroke-related) and peripheral vascular markets. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Alameda, California, Penumbra designs, develops, manufactures, and markets novel products that address unmet needs in mechanical thrombectomy (clot removal), embolization (vessel occlusion), and access/navigation technologies. Its neuro portfolio targets acute ischemic stroke via aspiration thrombectomy systems like the Lightning platform, while the peripheral segment focuses on deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arteriovenous malformations using systems like Indigo and coil technologies. Penumbra operates globally, with ~85% of revenue from the U.S., and emphasizes R&D (15-20% of revenue) to drive minimally invasive solutions. The company benefits from a direct sales force, strong IP portfolio (700+ patents), and manufacturing in the U.S. and Costa Rica. In 2023, it reported $1.0B in revenue, positioning it as a leader in the ~$2B U.S. mechanical thrombectomy market, fueled by rising stroke incidence (795K U.S. cases/year) and guideline expansions for late-window interventions.

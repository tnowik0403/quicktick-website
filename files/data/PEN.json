Company Overview\n\nPenumbra, Inc. is a thrombectomy company focused on developing technologies for challenging medical conditions, such as ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, such as pulmonary embolism, and acute limb ischemia. The Company's broad portfolio, which includes computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT), centers on removing blood clots from head-to-toe. Domiciled in the US, Penumbra designs, manufactures, and markets an array of thrombectomy and embolization devices and equipment to mechanically remove blood clots. The firm sells mainly to hospitals and physicians. These minimally invasive devices are primarily used in the acute care setting for patients with stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, cranial aneurysms, and other vascular diseases.\n\nThe company was founded by Arani Bose and Adam Elsesser on June 21, 2004 and is headquartered in Alameda, CA. By pioneering these innovations, we support healthcare providers, hospitals and clinics in more than 100 countries, working to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nPenumbra offers a comprehensive portfolio of medical devices across multiple therapeutic areas:\n\n**Neurovascular Products:**\n- Penumbra System, an integrated mechanical thrombectomy system comprising reperfusion catheters and separators, the 3D Revascularization device, aspiration tubing, and aspiration pump under the Penumbra RED, SENDit, JET, ACE, BMX, Max, 3D Revascularization Device, and Penumbra ENGINE brands\n- Neuro embolization coiling systems that includes the Penumbra Coil 400, a detachable coil that provides an alternative for the treatment of aneurysms and other complex lesions, as well as detachable coils to treat patients with a wide range of neurovascular lesions under the Penumbra SMART COIL and Penumbra SwiftPAC Coil brands\n\n**Peripheral Products:**\n- Peripheral thrombectomy products, including the Indigo System for power aspiration of thrombus in the body; Lightning Flash, a mechanical thrombectomy system; Lightning Bolt 7, an arterial thrombectomy system; and CAT RX\n- Penumbra's Lightning Flash portfolio is the most advanced mechanical thrombectomy system on the market to address venous and pulmonary thrombus. It features Penumbra's Lightning CAVT technology with the latest dual clot detection algorithms, using both pressure and flow-based processes to detect blood clot and blood flow\n\n**Access Products:**\n- Guide catheters and the Penumbra distal delivery catheters under the Neuron, Neuron MAX, BENCHMARK, BMX, DDC, MIDWAY, and PX SLIM brands\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Thunderbolt Aspiration System:**\nThe objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Penumbra System including Thunderbolt Aspiration Tubing (Thunderbolt) in a population presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO). In October 2024, the company announced that it had completed enrolment of acute ischaemic stroke patients in this study.\n\n**Lightning Flash Expansion:**\nLightning Flash combines hypotube-based Indigo Aspiration Catheters with LightningTM Intelligent Aspiration, a unique computer assisted clot detection technology that can differentiate between clot and blood, designed to reduce blood loss and the need for clot-dissolving drugs, which may lower the risk of bleeding complications\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nPenumbra's growth strategy focuses on several key areas:\n- **Market Expansion:** Penumbra serves large and underpenetrated markets. Management estimates the U.S. thrombectomy market opportunity consists of roughly 1.25 million annual procedures, including roughly 200,000 in stroke and over 1 million in PE, DVT, arterial, and coronary\n- **Clinical Evidence:** The trial could significantly influence treatment practices for PE, similar to the impact of thrombectomy in stroke treatment. The absence of structural impediments in PE treatment, unlike in stroke, could facilitate broader adoption if the trial results are positive\n- **Technology Innovation:** Focus on computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) and modulated aspiration technologies\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company sells its products to specialist physicians, hospitals and clinics through a direct sales organization. It also distributes its products through distributors globally. Penumbra sells its products to hospitals and healthcare providers primarily through its direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, and through distributors in select international markets\n\n**Global Reach:** It has operations in the US, Brazil, Germany, Australia, Canada, Singapore, France and the UK.\n\n## 6.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **Aging Demographics:** Individuals aged ≥65 experience stroke rates 2.5 times higher than younger cohorts, driving long-run demand for intervention\n- **Clinical Evidence:** The landmark STORM-PE randomized controlled trial (RCT), which found that the use of mechanical thrombectomy, specifically computer assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT™), with anticoagulation achieved superior reduction in right heart strain compared to anticoagulation therapy alone\n- **Market Penetration Opportunity:** The PE and DVT markets are only 10% penetrated with mechanical thrombectomy devices. Most PE patients currently receive conservative medical management with oral anticoagulation alone\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Regulatory Challenges:** The $14.5 billion price tag has attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Under the current regulatory climate of early 2026, which has remained rigorous despite shifting political winds, antitrust experts warn that Boston Scientific may be required to divest certain peripheral intervention assets\n- **Competition:** Rival Stryker's recent acquisition of Inari Medical means Penumbra will be going head-to-head with a formidable, much-larger rival in peripheral thrombectomy\n- **China Market Challenges:** Revenue growth excluding China was significantly higher than reported growth, indicating challenges in that market\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Peripheral Thrombectomy Market:**\nAccording to GlobalData's US SKU tracker, Stryker and Penumbra comprise almost 90% of the total market share in the US in this market. GlobalData analyses show that Penumbra is currently beating out Stryker for top position in this market, primarily due to favourable sales of their Lightning Flash device\n\n**Mechanical Thrombectomy Market:**\nEstablished companies like Medtronic, Stryker, and Penumbra continue to dominate, leveraging their extensive R&D capabilities and broad product portfolios\n\n**Neurovascular Market:**\nCurrently, the neurovascular accessories market is dominated by Stryker and Medtronic, followed by Penumbra and Terumo\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- **Stryker:** Recently acquired Inari Medical for $4.9 billion, creating increased competition in peripheral thrombectomy\n- **Medtronic:** While Medtronic remains a giant in neurovascular stents and embolics, analysts suggest they now face a glaring gap in aspiration catheters where Penumbra was the undisputed king. Without a comparable high-end aspiration platform, Medtronic may be forced into its own mid-cap acquisition to remain competitive\n- **Boston Scientific:** Now acquiring Penumbra for $14.5 billion to enter neurovascular markets\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Penumbra's computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy, Lightning Flash, offers leading-edge technology that minimizes patient bleeding and whittles down procedure time\n- Market leadership in aspiration catheter technology\n\n## 10.

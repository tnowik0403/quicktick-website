It serves end-to-end needs from raw material preparation to final packaging, enabling efficient, hygienic, and sustainable production. Key markets include proteins (poultry, meat, seafood ~50% of revenue), dairy, bakery, ready-to-eat meals, pet food, and plant-based alternatives. With ~6,000 employees across 30+ countries, FoodTech operates manufacturing in the US, Europe, Brazil, and China, emphasizing aftermarket services (recurring revenue ~40-50% of total) and Industry 4.0 tech like AI-driven monitoring (e.g., Oscar and DataPredict platforms). Historically part of JBT Corporation since 2008 (ex-NYSE-listed), FoodTech generated ~65% of parent revenue in H1 2024. Post-spin, it will focus exclusively on food, positioning for agile growth amid rising demand for protein processing amid global population growth and labor shortages.

Moderate risk from cycles/protein volatility offset by services moat.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $35-40/share (post-spin, ~20-25M shares est. based on JBT float; implies $800M-$1B EV at 4-5x 2025E EBITDA ~$200M, per sum-of-parts models from Seeking Alpha/analyst previews). Upside from current JBT-implied value (~$25/share FoodTech portion). Hold if risk-averse; target 20-30% growth upside in 12-18 mo. post-listing.",

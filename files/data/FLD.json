(TSXV: FLD) is a Toronto-based private lender specializing in short-term, high-interest bridge financing to the real estate sector, primarily in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and surrounding regions of Ontario, Canada. Founded in 2015 and publicly listed on the TSX Venture Exchange since 2018, the company provides first and second mortgages to residential builders, commercial developers, and real estate investors for projects such as land acquisitions, construction, and renovations. Findev targets opportunities where traditional banks fall short due to speed, flexibility, or risk profile, charging interest rates typically between 12-18% with loan terms of 6-24 months. Its business model emphasizes rigorous due diligence, collateralized lending (loan-to-value ratios generally under 75%), and a portfolio of 20-40 active loans at any time, diversified across residential (70%+), commercial, and multi-family properties.\n\nAs a microcap lender (market cap under CAD 5M), Findev operates in a niche of non-bank financing amid Canada's hot housing market, but faces cyclical risks from interest rates and real estate slowdowns. Revenue is generated primarily from interest income (95%+ of total), with ancillary fees from loan origination and extensions. The company maintains a conservative balance sheet with no long-term debt, funded by equity raises, retained earnings, and short-term facilities. In FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024), it managed a loan portfolio peaking at CAD 25M, but portfolio size contracted amid high rates. Findev positions itself as a \"patient capital\" provider, focusing on repeat borrowers and value-add deals.

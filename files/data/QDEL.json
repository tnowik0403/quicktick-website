Formed by the 2022 merger of Quidel Corporation (rapid antigen tests, e.g., COVID-19) and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (high-throughput lab analyzers like VITROS), the company serves hospitals, reference labs, physician offices, and urgent care centers worldwide. Its Labs segment (80%+ of revenue) offers automated analyzers and assays for infectious diseases, cardiac, thyroid, women's health, and transplant testing. The Transfusion Medicine segment provides blood typing and cross-matching solutions. Headquartered in Athens, GA, with ~6,000 employees, QuidelOrtho generates ~55% of sales from the U.S., 20% Europe, and the rest internationally. Post-merger synergies have driven cost savings, but the company faces headwinds from COVID test demand normalization. Recent efforts emphasize menu expansion, new analyzers (e.g., Savanna), and chronic disease testing to achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth long-term. FY2023 revenue was $2.99B, but 2024 guidance reflects a transitional year amid restructuring.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported Aug 6, 2024)**: Revenue $704.5M (-14.5% YoY, missed est. $737M); Labs revenue $608M (-17%); Gross margin 49.4%; Net loss $117.4M or -$1.43/share.

Q3 earnings (Nov 5 est.) critical for inflection. Moderate risk appetite suits wait-for-trough.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $42 (33% upside)  \n  DCF-based (8% growth post-2025, 10% WACC, 55% margins); aligns with consensus PT $48 (JPM $50, BofA $45). Strong growth portfolio: Accumulate below $30 on positive Q3 beat.",

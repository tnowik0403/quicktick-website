(SIGI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 25, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $102.52\n- **Market Capitalization**: $6.22 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $90.62 - $109.76\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 20.84\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.47% (quarterly dividend of $0.35/share declared Oct 15, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nSelective Insurance Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SIGI) is a New Jersey-based holding company specializing in property and casualty (P&C) insurance, primarily serving the standard market for commercial and personal lines in the Eastern and Midwestern United States. Through subsidiaries like Selective Insurance Company of America, it underwrites a diverse portfolio including workers' compensation, general liability, commercial auto, property, and public entity insurance. The company operates across four segments: Standard Commercial Lines (75%+ of premiums, targeting small-to-midsize businesses), Personal Lines (homeowners/auto in select states), Excess and Surplus (E&S) Lines (higher-risk specialty), and Investments (managing ~$10B portfolio for float income).\n\nFounded in 1926 and publicly traded since 1997, Selective emphasizes disciplined underwriting, data analytics, and regional broker relationships to achieve combined ratios below industry averages (target <96%). With ~2,400 employees, it focuses on organic growth via rate increases, new business wins, and retention (95%+ renewal rates). In 2023, gross premiums written reached $4.0 billion, with a presence in 20+ states. Recent catastrophe losses from storms have pressured margins, but strong investment income ($200M+ quarterly) and E&S expansion provide tailwinds. Selective differentiates via proprietary SELECT technology suite for risk assessment and claims handling, positioning it as a regional leader amid consolidating P&C sector. Overall, SIGI trades at a premium to peers on ROE (12-15%) but faces cyclical risks from weather and inflation.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Oct 22, 2024)**: Reported net premiums written up 12% YoY to $1.16B; operating income $1.02/share (beat estimates by $0.12).

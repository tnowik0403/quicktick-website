(PARR) is an independent, growth-oriented downstream energy company operating across the Western U.S., with a focus on refining, retail marketing, and logistics. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company processes crude oil and other feedstocks into transportation fuels, renewable diesel, and specialty products at three refineries: Kapolei (94 Mbpd capacity, Hawaii), Tacoma (42 Mbpd, Washington), and Newcastle (18 Mbpd, Wyoming). Its Retail segment operates ~125 stores under Hele and nomnom brands in Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest, selling fuels, merchandise, and food. The Logistics segment includes marine terminals, storage tanks, and pipelines supporting its operations. Par Pacific markets refined products to wholesale distributors, retailers, and industrial users, emphasizing resilient Hawaii margins and renewable fuels transition. With ~220 Mbpd total throughput capacity (post-renewables ramp), it serves niche regional markets less exposed to Gulf Coast competition. The company generated $8.0 billion in FY 2023 revenue, driven by refining crack spreads, and is pivoting toward sustainable fuels amid energy transition pressures. Recent strategic moves include retail expansion and Wyoming refinery conversion to renewable diesel production.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q filed August 8, 2024):\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 Value       | YoY Change |\n  |-------------------------|---------------------|------------|\n  | Revenue                | $2.2 billion       | +5%       |\n  | Net Income             | $47.4 million      | From loss |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA        | $142.8 million     | +$50M     |\n  | Refining Operating Income | $105.5 million  | N/A       |\n  | Throughput             | 179 Mbpd           | +10%      |\n  - Hawaii refinery crack spread averaged $25.55/bbl (vs. $18.20/bbl national 3-2-1).\n- **July 2024**: Commissioned pretreat unit at Wyoming Renewable Diesel (RD) facility, targeting 10,000 bpd production by Q4 2024; first RD cargoes shipped.\n- **June 2024**: Acquired additional retail assets in Washington, expanding nomnom stores to 30+ locations.\n- **May 2024**: Q1 earnings showed Adjusted EBITDA of $69.7 million amid softer crack spreads; refineries ran at 95%+ utilization.\n- **October 1, 2024**: Announced board refresh with new independent director appointment (experienced in energy M&A).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Accelerate renewables: Full Wyoming RD conversion (10,000 bpd nameplate) by end-2024, with pretreat unit online; potential for 20,000 bpd expansion using co-processing.\n- Retail expansion: Target 150+ stores by 2026 via tuck-in acquisitions and greenfield builds in PNW/Hawaii; focus on high-margin food/merchandise (nomnom QSR concept).\n- Operational efficiency: High Hawaii utilization (100%+ in Q2); logistics optimization to cut costs 5-10%.\n- Capital allocation: $200-250M annual capex (mostly renewables/retail); return capital via $0.05/share quarterly dividend (yield ~0.8%).\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category     | Headwinds                                                                 | Tailwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Cyclical refining margins (Q3 2024 crack spreads ~$15/bbl, down 30% YoY); Wyoming RD ramp risks/delays; Hawaiian supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g., Red Hill cleanup ongoing). | Resilient Hawaii economics ($20+/bbl premiums); retail stability (10% YoY comp sales growth Q2); low debt (Net Debt/EBITDA 0.8x). |\n| **Sector**  | Declining diesel demand; EV transition eroding gasoline volumes; oversupply from new capacity (e.g., Phillips 66 Rodeo RD). | RD credits/D4 RINs ($2+/gal premiums); West Coast fuel shortages; geopolitical crude volatility favoring independents. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Refining**: Gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, asphalt, marine fuel (80% revenue).\n- **Retail**: Fuels, convenience store items, foodservice (Hele/nomnom); 125 stores, $500M+ annual sales.\n- **Logistics**: 2.8M bbl storage, terminals in HI/WA/WY, trucking/pipeline transport.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- Wyoming RD facility: 10,000 bpd renewable diesel from vegetable oils/waste; Q4 2024 full ramp, eligible for LCFS/RIN credits (~$1.50/gal uplift).\n- nomnom restaurant expansion: 10 new PNW sites planned for 2025, emphasizing fresh/healthy menu to capture 20% food sales margin.\n- Potential co-processing at Kapolei/Tacoma for RD blending (feasibility studies 2025).\n\n## Market Share Approximations and Forecast\n- **Current US Refining Market Share**: ~0.9% of 18M bpd capacity (PARR: 154 Mbpd conventional + 10 Mbpd RD planned).\n  - Hawaii: 95% dominance (sole refiner post-2019 Chevron closure).\n  - Wyoming/PNW: 5-10% regional share.\n  - US RD: <1% now; targeting 0.5% post-ramp.\n- **Forecast**: Stable 1% US refining share to 2026 (renewables offset fossil declines); RD share growth to 1-2% by 2027 via expansions.

Strong growth upside if crack spreads rebound/$2+ RD credits.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $35 (35% upside) – DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth, $600M 2025 EBITDA); aligns with 5x EV/EBITDA peer avg post-RD ramp.

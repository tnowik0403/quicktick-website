These efforts have helped lead the kidney care community through scaled participation and investment in these programs, which are part of the Comprehensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) option within the government's voluntary Kidney Care Choices (KCC) model.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nFinancial and operating highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2025: Consolidated revenues were $3.420 billion. Operating income was $506 million and adjusted operating income was $517 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.04 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.51. Operating cash flow was $842 million and free cash flow was $604 million.\n\nIn 2024, DaVita's revenue was $12.82 billion, an increase of 5.56% compared to the previous year's $12.14 billion. Earnings were $936.34 million, an increase of 35.40%.\n\nDialysis provider DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) met Wall Streets revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales up 4.8% year on year to $3.42 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.51 per share was 20.9% below analysts' consensus estimates.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n- On August 5, 2025, DaVita told the SEC that the attack caused a temporary disruption to its operations and cost the company $13.5 million in the second quarter, $12.5 million of which was due to administrative costs remediating the attack, hiring third-party cybersecurity specialists, and restoring systems. The remaining $1.0 million was due to an increase in patient care costs. The $13.5 million figure does not include costs incurred due to the business interruption.\n\n- Data from 2.7 million people were exposed after a ransomware attack on kidney care provider DaVita this spring. But the cyberattack negatively impacted DaVita's billing and revenue collection as well as patient census, which the provider expects will hit treatment revenue and volumes for the full year.\n\n- Second was the negative impact of the census trends from higher mortality from a severe flu season and lost admissions opportunities as the result of Hurricane Helene and the cyber incident.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- International expansion continues with new clinics in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia, supporting long-term growth beyond the US market.\n\n- Structural cost reductions and clinical innovation are improving operational efficiency, patient outcomes, and margins, mitigating risk from volume fluctuations. Strategic international expansion is driving diversified growth and presents opportunities for further revenue and margin gains.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nBetween 2005 and 2019, a period when both DaVita and Fresenius made several large acquisitions, their combined market share increased from 59.1% to 77.1%, while the share owned by independent facilities decreased from 20.4% to 10.6%.\n\nAccording to our data, the IDNs whose renal dialysis centers make up the largest share of the renal dialysis market in the U.S. are Fresenius Kidney Care (AKA Fresenius Medical Care), DaVita Kidney Care, and US Renal Care. Together they make up 91% of the U.S. market based on the percentage of procedures performed, with Fresenius performing the most at 57%.\n\nAs of 2024, the company commanded an estimated 37% of the U.S. dialysis market, making it one of the two dominant providers alongside Fresenius Medical Care.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nDaVita and Fresenius Medical Care collectively treat about 75% of U.S. outpatient dialysis patients. This duopoly highlights the concentrated nature of the dialysis market share. Fresenius Medical Care's advantage includes manufacturing its own dialysis equipment.\n\nBeyond the top two, U.S. Renal Care, Dialysis Clinic, Inc., and Satellite Healthcare are significant providers. Baxter Healthcare Corporation is also a major competitor, particularly in dialysis solutions and devices.\n\nFresenius Medical Care and DaVita control the hemodialysis market with 84%, which translates to 366,000 patients out of a total of 433,000 patients.The two companies employ more than 135,000 employees.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nDaVita Inc announced that it has agreed to terms on the expansion of its international operations in Brazil and Colombia, and its entry into Chile and Ecuador. The deal, which is consistent with DaVita's disciplined investment strategy, involves four separate acquisitions from Fresenius Medical Care for a total purchase price of $300M USD. Upon completion of the transactions and when combined with DaVita's existing Latin American operations in Brazil and Colombia, the Company will have more than 15,000 DaVita teammates providing high-quality clinical care to more than 60,000 patients in more than 270 clinics.\n\nDaVita's international operations provide life-sustaining care in 12 countries outside of the United States and, assuming completion of the transactions announced today, will have grown from serving 23,000 patients in 2017 to serving more than 79,000 patients.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns about 45% of DaVita.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Cybersecurity Incident (2025):\nThe attack occurred on Saturday, April 12, 2025, and is impacting some of its operations, according to a Monday, April 14, 2025, 8K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Denver, CO-based Fortune 500 firm operates more than 2,650 outpatient treatment centers in the United States, 509 centers in 13 other countries, employs 76,000 people globally, and served around 200,000 patients in the United States last year.\n\nKidney dialysis giant DaVita says nearly 916,000 people had personal and medical information exposed in an April ransomware attack. The breach, which the company disclosed in state filings, compromised names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance details, medical records, tax ID numbers, addresses and even images of checks made out to the company.\n\n### Q3 2025 Performance:\nOur third quarter performance was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve our full-year guidance,\" said Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita.\n\nWhile revenue came in only slightly below analyst forecasts, the earnings per share figure missed the consensus estimate by approximately 23%. This substantial earnings miss appears to be the primary driver behind the stock's negative after-market reaction, which saw shares decline by nearly 0.2%.\n\n### Leadership Changes:\nDaVita, a leading provider of kidney care services, today announced two key additions to its executive leadership team: Stephanie Hendrickson has been named Chief People Officer (CPO) and Steve Phillips will serve as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), effective immediately. Both leaders bring more than a decade of proven success at DaVita and deep expertise that will help shape the company's next chapter of growth and innovation.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Analysis Summary:\nDaVita demonstrates several strong fundamentals despite recent challenges. The company maintains a dominant market position with 37% market share in the U.S. dialysis market, has expanded internationally through strategic acquisitions worth $300M, and continues to innovate through integrated care models and technology partnerships. However, the company faces significant headwinds from the recent cybersecurity incident that exposed 2.7 million patient records and cost $13.5 million in Q3 2025, plus ongoing operational challenges from patient mortality trends and declining treatment volumes.\n\nThe company's financial performance shows mixed signals - while revenue grew 4.8% year-over-year to $3.42 billion in Q3 2025, adjusted EPS of $2.51 missed analyst expectations by 20.9%. The international expansion strategy and strong value-based care partnerships with 2,300+ physicians provide long-term growth potential. With strong backing from Berkshire Hathaway (45% ownership) and a defensive business model serving critical medical needs, the company maintains financial stability.\n\nAccording to 4 analysts, the average rating for DVA stock is \"Hold.\" The 12-month stock price target is $145.0, which is an increase of 24.84% from the latest price.\n\n### Investment Rating: 6.8/10\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Positive factors:** Dominant market position, international expansion, stable cash flows, strong institutional backing, growing integrated care segment, defensive healthcare sector positioning\n- **Risk factors:** Cybersecurity incident impact, declining treatment volumes, regulatory pressures, high Medicare dependence, earnings volatility\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $135-$145\n\nBased on analyst consensus targets, the company's defensive business model, strong market position, international growth opportunities, and recovery potential post-cybersecurity incident, a fair value range of $135-$145 represents reasonable upside potential from the current price of ~$106, aligning with the moderate risk appetite and growth-focused investment criteria.",

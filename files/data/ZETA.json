Moderate risk via profitability (18% margins), but valuation stretch and ad cyclicality cap at 8 (vs. 10 for derisked leaders).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $35.00 (38% upside from $25.22). DCF-based (25% CAGR to 2027, 15x 2027 EV/sales terminal, 12% WACC); aligns with 6x 2025 sales ($1.3B rev est.). Entry below $28 ideal for moderate risk. Hold above $40. \n\n*Sources: Q2 Earnings Transcript (Aug 1, 2024 via Zeta IR); Gartner 2024; Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (Oct 11 data); Seeking Alpha/Benzinga articles (Aug-Oct 2024); Company 10-Q (Aug 2024).

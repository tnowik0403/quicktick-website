Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Louisville, Colorado, Gaia serves a global audience of spiritual seekers, wellness enthusiasts, and truth explorers through its flagship gaia.com subscription service (monthly $11.99 or annual $99). With over 8,000 titles and 30+ original series annually, Gaia differentiates via niche, ad-free programming curated for personal growth.

The company targets the $4.4B global online video-on-demand wellness market (Statista 2024 est.), emphasizing community-building features like live events and member forums.

YTD underperformance (-12%) prices in risks; recovery as cocoa eases (forecast $6,000/ton 2025).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: **$215/share** (11% upside)  \n  DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth; normalized 45% margins). Strong growth upside from salty snacks/international (5% CAGR potential post-2025), moderate risk via hedges/dividends. Hold for income; buy on dips below $185.",

Current Market Data\n\nThe current stock price of Hershey Co (HSY) is $201.07 as of January 15, 2026. The market cap of Hershey (HSY) is $36.36B as of Jan 6, 2026. As of 1/2/2026, the company has a market cap of 36.99B with an enterprise value of 41.57B, trailing P/E of 27.27, forward P/E of 27.32, price/sales (ttm) of 4.09, and profit margin of 11.84%. Revenue (ttm) is 11.49B with net income available to common (ttm) of 1.36B.\n\nHershey (HSY) faces mixed market sentiment ahead of its upcoming earnings report on February 5, 2026. The stock has shown resilience with a 7-day return of 8.83% but is also projected to see a 47.96% drop in EPS year-over-year.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company's extensive portfolio includes chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products under brands like Hershey's, Reese's, Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Almond Joy, Brookside, barkTHINS, Cadbury, Good & Plenty, Heath, Kit Kat, Payday, Rolo, Twizzlers, Sour Strips, Whoppers, York, Ice Breakers, Breath Savers, and Bubble Yum. In the better-for-you segment, the company offers Lily's products, while its salty snacks portfolio includes SkinnyPop, Pirates Booty, Dot's Homestyle Pretzels, and ONE Bar brands.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nIn early January 2026, The Hershey Company expanded its collaboration with Shaquille O'Neal by launching Shaq-A-Licious SLAMS gummies nationwide and rolled out new Valentine's Day products while boosting marketing support for its 125-year-old flagship chocolate bar. Recent product innovations include Shaq-A-Licious XL Gummies and Shaq-A-Licious SLAMS created with Shaquille O'Neal, limited-edition treats like the Hershey's Dubai-Inspired Chocolate Bar, and seasonal products and beverages available at HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE WORLD attractions.\n\nHershey (NYSE: HSY) released a limited‑edition Dubai‑inspired chocolate bar on Dec. 4, 2025. The bar combines Hershey's milk chocolate with pistachio cream and crispy kadayif, sold in a classic break‑apart format. Only 10,000 bars will be produced, priced at $8.99 each.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThese moves highlight Hershey's emphasis on multi-sensory candy experiences and heavier brand investment, aiming to refresh consumer engagement across both chocolate and non-chocolate treats. The 20% increase in advertising for Hershey's core chocolate bar is the most relevant development here, because it connects directly to the company's effort to refine price pack architecture and demand shaping. By reinforcing a core, higher visibility brand while also expanding into gummies and seasonal products like the Valentine's range, Hershey is leaning into diversification across chocolate and non chocolate treats as it works to support margins.\n\nThe company has targeted compound annual growth of 2% to 4% in net sales and 6% to 8% in adjusted EPS through 2030. Kirk Tanner, the new CEO, is committed to advancing Hershey's ambition to be a Leading Snacking Powerhouse and to deliver long-term, sustainable growth.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company markets and sells its products to wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires, and department stores. While specific client relationships are not disclosed, the company's broad distribution network suggests partnerships with major retailers across multiple channels.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results:\nConsolidated net sales of $3,181.4 million, an increase of 6.5%. Organic, constant currency net sales increased 6.2%. Reported net income of $276.3 million. Revenue: 3.18 billion dollars, up 6.5% year-over-year. Earnings per share: $1.30, a 22.64% surprise over the forecast.\n\nHershey last released its earnings results on Thursday, October 30th. The company reported $1.30 earnings per share for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $1.06 by $0.24. The firm had revenue of $3.18 billion during the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $3.11 billion.\n\n### 2025 Guidance:\nHershey raised full-year 2025 guidance to ~3% net sales growth, reported EPS $5.48–$5.72 (down 48%–50%) and adjusted EPS now projected at $5.90–$6.00 (down ~36%–37%). The company expects tariffs of $160–$170M, interest expense ~$195M, capex ~$425M and automation savings ~$150M.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Cocoa Cost Inflation**: The company expects the surge in cocoa prices to continue to put significant pressure on earnings in 2025. Hershey's adjusted gross profit margin for 2025 is expected to contract by approximately 650 to 700 basis points due to historically high cocoa prices, sugar and other raw material inflation, along with incremental labor inflation and potential tariffs.\n\n- **Tariff Impact**: The company expects tariffs of $160–$170M.\n\n- **Consumer Pressure**: Unrelenting pressure on consumer pocketbooks could dent purchases of more indulgent and discretionary categories, such as confectionery and snacking.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Cocoa Price Stabilization**: While cocoa futures have retreated, based on what we know today, we continue to forecast cocoa inflation in 2026. While the long-term outlook is brightening…we will continue to manage through the commodity cost inflation and tariff expenses. Spot cocoa prices, which peaked above $12,000 a metric ton in April 2024, have since fallen almost 50% to about $6,300. Sugar prices have also plunged more than 40% from their 2023 highs.\n\n- **Market Share Gains**: During the year to date, Hershey was able to return chocolate retail sales growth to 4% after a 1% decline in 2024; lift sweets market penetration by 65 basis points via innovation and brand-building; drive mainstream US candy, mint and gum market share expansion of over 15 basis points; and boost retail sales growth for SkinnyPop by 6%.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nHershey is a leading US confectionery manufacturer (around a $54 billion market, according to Euromonitor), controlling around 36% of the domestic chocolate aisle. Their largest market share is in the Chocolate Production industry, where they account for an estimated 16.8% of total industry revenue. Hershey is estimated to own a share of 28.9% of the confectionery market, positioning itself as a strong player in the industry. While Hershey holds a substantial market share, it is second only to the market leader with a share of 31.1%.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Major Competitors:\nMars is one of the biggest names in the confectionery world, boasting a diverse portfolio that includes iconic brands such as M&M's, Snickers, and Twix. In addition to their strong presence in the chocolate segment, Mars also competes in gum, mints, and non-chocolate confectioneries.\n\nMondelez International, the parent company of brands like Cadbury, Toblerone, and Milka, is a key competitor in the global chocolate market. Mondelez's extensive product range and strong international presence pose a significant challenge to Hershey, particularly in markets outside North America.\n\nFerrero, an Italian confectionery company, is known for its premium products such as Ferrero Rocher, Nutella, and Kinder. The acquisition of Nestlé's U.S. candy business has further bolstered Ferrero's position in the American market.\n\nIn terms of the total confectionery market, Mars has Hershey beat for largest market share, but only barely edged out their competitor by about 0.4 percent.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) completed its acquisition of LesserEvil on November 19, 2025, adding a high-growth, better-for-you snack brand to its portfolio. LesserEvil brings organic popcorn and puffs that are USDA Organic, non-GMO, and made without artificial dyes or preservatives, plus additional manufacturing capacity. The deal is positioned to broaden Hershey's salty-snack and better-for-you offerings and complements brands like SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty; the company's salty portfolio grew 1.5x in 2024.\n\nThe company has also expanded its collaboration with Shaquille O'Neal by launching Shaq-A-Licious SLAMS gummies nationwide.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Leadership Transition:\nKirk Tanner joined Hershey in August 2025 as President and CEO. Kirk is a seasoned, performance-driven leader with more than 30 years of experience in the food and beverage industry, driving strategic growth for iconic brands. Before joining Hershey, Tanner was President and Chief Executive Officer of Wendy's. Prior to Wendy's, he spent three decades at PepsiCo, Inc., where he served as Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America, overseeing a $25 billion business across a diverse portfolio of iconic brands such as Gatorade, Mountain Dew and Celsius.\n\n### Product Innovation:\nIn the third quarter, Hershey products comprised 5 of the top 10 innovations in the US, reflecting our bigger, bolder, more impactful innovation strategy. Reese's Oreo was the top new item in the category in Q3, and retail sales trends are exceeding our internal targets.\n\n### Analyst Upgrades:\nRecent upgrades from analysts highlight easing cocoa costs and potential growth opportunities amid cautious market sentiment. Hershey price target was raised to $210 from $190 at UBS.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: 6.5/10\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe Hershey Company presents a mixed investment opportunity with both significant challenges and emerging tailwinds. While the company faces substantial headwinds from cocoa cost inflation and tariff pressures in 2025, several factors support a moderately positive outlook:\n\n**Positive Factors:**\n- Market leadership position with 36% share of domestic chocolate market\n- Strong brand portfolio with iconic names like Reese's and Hershey's\n- Recent successful product innovations, particularly Reese's Oreo collaboration\n- New experienced CEO Kirk Tanner with proven track record in food & beverage sector\n- Cocoa prices stabilizing from 2024 peaks, providing future margin relief potential\n- Strong Q3 2025 performance beating analyst expectations\n- Strategic acquisitions expanding into better-for-you snacking segments\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Projected 36-37% decline in 2025 adjusted EPS due to commodity inflation\n- Significant tariff headwinds ($160-170M expected impact)\n- High P/E ratios (27x) suggesting limited valuation upside\n- Consumer spending pressure on discretionary categories\n- Intense competition from Mars, Mondelez, and other global players\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $185-$195\n\nAnalyst fair value estimates yield a $194.35 fair value, in line with its current price. Given the current trading price of ~$201, the stock appears fairly valued to slightly overvalued in the near term. However, the 2026 recovery potential as commodity costs normalize and efficiency initiatives take hold could support current valuations.\n\n**Investment Recommendation:** HOLD with bias toward accumulation on any weakness below $185. The company's strong market position, brand strength, and potential for margin recovery in 2026 make it attractive for investors with moderate risk appetite seeking exposure to a defensive consumer staples name with growth upside potential.",

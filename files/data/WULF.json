(Nasdaq: WULF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com):\n- **Stock Price**: $6.68\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.02 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $1.02 - $6.84\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 15.2 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $2.24 billion\n\n## Company Overview\nTeraWulf Inc. (WULF) is a U.S.-based digital asset technology company specializing in sustainable Bitcoin mining and emerging high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Founded in 2021 and publicly listed via SPAC merger in 2022, TeraWulf operates two primary facilities: the Lake Mariner facility in New York (powered by 100% hydroelectric power) and the Nautilus Cryptomine in Pennsylvania (powered nearly 100% by zero-carbon nuclear energy). The company emphasizes ESG principles, achieving a carbon-negative footprint certified by the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI score of -13.7 as of Q2 2024). \n\nTeraWulf primarily engages in self-mining Bitcoin using state-of-the-art miners (e.g., Bitmain S19j Pro, S21, and Hydro units), with diversification into HPC/AI data centers to mitigate crypto volatility. As of Q3 2024 updates, it operates ~7.7 EH/s of self-mining hashrate (up from 5.0 EH/s avg in Q2), holding 724 BTC (valued ~$68M at current prices). Revenue is generated via self-mining (~85-90% of total), hosting, and energy arbitrage. Q2 2024 revenue reached $27.1M (verified from Aug 13, 2024 earnings), driven by hashrate expansion amid Bitcoin's rally. Strategically, TeraWulf targets 10 EH/s self-mining by year-end 2024 and 25 EH/s long-term, while pivoting to HPC for recurring revenue. With ~91% gross margins in mining (Q2 2024), it positions as a low-cost, green operator in a capital-intensive sector.

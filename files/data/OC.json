Founded in 1892 and headquartered in Clayton, Missouri, Olin produces essential industrial chemicals like chlorine, caustic soda, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), hydrochloric acid, and potassium hydroxide via its energy-intensive membrane and diaphragm electrolytic processes. These serve water treatment, pulp/paper, agriculture, and neutralizers markets. The Vinyls sub-segment produces ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) for PVC resin production. The Epoxy segment manufactures allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin (ECH), and downstream epoxy resins used in protective coatings, electronics, adhesives, and composites for aerospace, automotive, wind energy, and infrastructure. Winchester, acquired in 2009, is a top U.S. ammunition brand for hunting, shooting sports, law enforcement, and military applications, with small-caliber military propellant sales. Olin operates 40+ manufacturing sites globally, with ~8,500 employees. In a cyclical chemicals industry, Olin leverages vertical integration (e.g., chlor-alkali feedstocks for epoxy/vinyls) for cost advantages, generating ~$6.6B in 2023 revenue. Recent focus shifts toward high-margin Epoxy growth and Winchester volume amid chemical market softness.

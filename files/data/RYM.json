Founded in 1984 and listed on NZX/ASX since 1999, Ryman develops, owns, and operates integrated retirement villages that offer independent villa/apartment living, serviced apartments, and full rest home/hospital-level care. Its model emphasizes high-quality design, community-focused amenities (e.g., gyms, pools, theaters), and a unique \"Resident Care Fund\" that refunds capital to families upon resale or death, enhancing appeal.\n\nAs of FY24 (ended 30 Jun 2024), Ryman manages 45 villages (38 in NZ, 7 in Australia) with 8,979 retirement units (occupancy 91%), serving ~13,000 residents. Revenue is derived from: resident living fees (licenses/weekly fees, ~70%), care services (~20%), and development profits from new unit sales (~10%). The company has a massive development pipeline of 10,900+ units over 10+ years, funded via low-cost resident capital (no debt on completed villages) and bank facilities.\n\nRyman targets affluent over-75s in growth corridors, leveraging demographics (NZ/Aus aging populations projected to double by 2050). FY24 saw record development profit despite headwinds, positioning Ryman for recovery as rates ease. Dual-listing supports liquidity; HQ in Christchurch, NZ.\n\n*Verified FY24 Financials (28 Aug 2024 earnings release):*\n| Metric | FY24 (NZD m) | YoY Change |\n|--------|--------------|------------|\n| Revenue | 1,070.3 | +27.5% |\n| EBITDAF | 284.7 | +13.4% |\n| Development Profit | 147.8 | +11% |\n| NPAT | 91.5 | -41% (impaired assets) |\n| Total Assets | 7,922 | +15% |\n| Net Debt | 1,456 | N/A |\n\n*Current Stock Metrics (as of 18 Oct 2024 close):*\n- ASX:RYM: AUD 4.79 (▼0.21%)\n- NZX:RYM: NZD 5.27 (▼0.57%)\n- Market Cap: ~AUD 3.34B / NZD 3.67B\n- 52-wk Range: AUD 3.78–6.55\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **28 Aug 2024**: FY24 results announced – record revenue/development profit; NZ$130m impairment on 3 Aus villages due to high rates/construction delays; resumed dividends (4cps interim).\n- **16 Sep 2024**: Entered agreement to acquire 50% stake in Grace Management Group (NZ aged care provider, 13 facilities, 700+ beds) for NZ$80-100m, boosting care capacity (subject to approvals).\n- **3 Oct 2024**: Announced first Aus village expansion (Sanctuary Carolands, QLD: +90 units).\n- **Oct 2024 discussions**: Online forums (HotCopper, Sharescene) highlight rate cut optimism; broker upgrades (Macquarie \"Outperform\", target NZ$7.20; Forsyth Barr \"Accumulate\", NZ$6.80 post-results).\n- **Q3 2024**: 95 new villa settlements (vs. 82 prior); Aus settlements up 50% YoY.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core pillars**: Accelerate Aus expansion (target 20% of portfolio by 2030 from 15%); 1,100 unit settlements FY25; invest NZ$1.2B capex FY25 on 12 villages under construction.\n- **Pipeline**: 3,900 units in 18 months; long-term 10,900+ units (NZ:80%, Aus:20%).\n- **Innovation**: \"Ryman Rewards\" loyalty program; digital health tech pilots; sustainability (solar on 20+ villages by 2025).\n- **Funding**: 90% resident-funded; aim sub-20% gearing.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company** | Strong balance sheet (BBB credit); 91% occupancy; resident-funded model resilient to downturns. | High net debt/EBITDAF (5.1x FY24); Aus ramp-up delays (high build costs). |\n| **Sector (Retirement/Aged Care)** | Aging boom (NZ 75+ pop +50% by 2033); undersupply (NZ needs 20k+ beds); RBNZ rate cuts (OCR 4.75% Oct 2024). | Elevated rates slowed settlements (industry -20% FY24); labor shortages (care workers); regulatory scrutiny (NZ PPC reviews). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Independent Living**: Villas/apartments (licenses: upfront capital + weekly fees ~NZ$1,200/unit).\n- **Serviced Care**: Apartments with meals/support (~NZ$1,500/wk).\n- **Full Care**: Rest home/hospital (~NZ$1,800/wk; 1,900 beds).\n- Amenities: On-site gyms, cinemas, cafes; 24/7 emergency care.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Under Construction (12 villages)**: 1,200 units (e.g., Vida St Johns, NZ: 200 units, completion H2 2025).\n- **Planned**: 10 greenfield (e.g., Christchurch North, 400 units by 2027); Aus focus (Byron Bay, NSW: 250 units approved Sep 2024).\n- **Grace M&A**: Adds specialist dementia care (operational by mid-2025).\n- **Tech**: AI monitoring pilots in 5 villages (2025 rollout).\n\n## Market Share & Forecast\n- **NZ Retirement Villages**: ~27% (5,800/21,500 units; source: NZX FY24, Retirement Villages Assoc Sep 2024).\n- **Aus**: <5% (nascent; 1,300 units vs. 100k+ national).\n- **Forecast**: NZ stable at 27-29% (mature); Aus to 8-10% by 2028 (+300bps YoY via pipeline).

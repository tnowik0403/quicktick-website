Founded in 1917 and headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the company operates through three main segments: Vocational (e.g., refuse collection vehicles, concrete mixers, roll-off trucks under brands like McNeilus and London), Access Equipment (aerial work platforms via JLG Industries), and Defense/Fire & Emergency (military vehicles like JLTVs and fire apparatus/ambulances via Pierce Manufacturing). In FY2024 (ended Sept 30, 2024), OSK generated ~$9.9 billion in sales, with Vocational contributing ~47%, Access ~29%, and Defense/Fire & Emergency ~24%. The company emphasizes innovative, purpose-built vehicles for critical infrastructure, public safety, and military applications, with a growing focus on electrification and next-gen tech. OSK benefits from strong U.S. government contracts (e.g., DoD JLTV program) and municipal fleets, while expanding internationally. Recent strategic moves, including a planned spin-off of its Access Equipment segment, aim to unlock shareholder value by creating focused pure-plays. OSK's competitive moat stems from its scale, engineering expertise, and ~50%+ market share in key U.S. niches like Class 8 vocational trucks and fire apparatus.

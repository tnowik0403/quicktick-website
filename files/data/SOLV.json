Solventum Corporation was a business of 3M Company. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced spin-off of Solventum Corporation. The Spin-Off was completed through a distribution of approximately 80.1% of the Company's outstanding common stock to holders of record of 3M's common stock as of March 18, 2024, which resulted in the issuance of 172,709,505 shares of common stock. As a result of the Distribution, the Company became an independent public company. Solventum's common stock is listed under the symbol \"SOLV\" on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSolventum is a leading global healthcare company with a broad portfolio of trusted solutions that leverage deep material science, data science, and digital capabilities to address critical customer needs.

As a new company with a long legacy of creating breakthrough solutions for our customers' toughest challenges, we pioneer game-changing innovations at the intersection of health, material and data science that change patients' lives for the better — while empowering healthcare professionals to perform at their best.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nSolventum Corporation stock is priced at $79.71, giving the company a market capitalization of 13.83B. It carries a P/E multiple of 9.09. Solventum has delivered a 9.30% change over the past year, with a 52-week range between 60.70 and 88.20. The average daily trading volume for Solventum is 197,044. As of Jan 21, 2026, the company has 22 K employees.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe Company's operating activities are primarily managed through three segments: MedSurg, Dental Solutions, and Health Information Systems.\n\n**MedSurg Segment:**\n• The Medsurg segment offers solutions for negative pressure wound therapy, advanced wound dressings, advanced skin care, I.V. site management, sterilization assurance, temperature management, surgical supplies, medical tapes and wraps, stethoscopes, medical electrodes, and medical technologies for original equipment manufacturers.\n• It leads the global market in advanced wound care, driven by the V.A.C. (Vacuum Assisted Closure) therapy system.\n\n**Dental Solutions Segment:**\n• Its Dental Solutions segment provides a suite of dental and orthodontic products, including brackets, aligners, restorative cements, and bonding agents.\n• A leader in restorative materials (Filtek) and orthodontics (Clarity).\n\n**Health Information Systems:**\n• The Health Information Systems provides software solutions and services for health care systems, such as computer-assisted, physician documentation, direct-to-bill and coding automation, classification methodologies, speech recognition, and data visualization platforms.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nIn 2025, the company launched the next generation of its V.A.C. therapy with integrated telehealth monitoring, allowing clinicians to track wound healing remotely. Perhaps the most exciting area is HIS, where Solventum's \"360 Encompass\" platform now features fully autonomous medical coding. By utilizing large language models (LLMs) to interpret clinical notes, the system reduces hospital billing errors and administrative overhead, a critical value proposition in a labor-strapped healthcare environment.\n\nSolventum announced a strategic partnership with SprintRay, a leading provider of chairside 3D dental printing, to meet the needs of dentists with in-office chairside 3D printed crowns, inlays, onlays and more. This research and development and commercialization agreement is focused on developing and bringing to market high-quality, durable and permanent same-day restorations.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nSolventum is executing a clear strategic plan to drive revenue growth, margin expansion, and cash flow improvement with a focus on high-potential markets where the Company has a path to leadership. Over the past year, the Company has carefully analyzed its markets to select key growth driver areas that will propel growth across the business segments.\n\nSolventum targets 4-5% organic sales growth, 23-25% operating margins, 10% EPS CAGR over 3 years, and 80%+ free cash flow conversion by 2028. The phases are: 1) Stabilizing business through culture and talent enhancement, 2) Enhancing strategic focus in high-potential markets, 3) Portfolio optimization through organic and inorganic growth.\n\nSolventum has launched 'Transform for the Future', a new multiyear global initiative to further accelerate its long-term growth strategy and strengthen its position in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Once fully implemented, the Program is expected to generate approximately $500 million in annual cost savings, with a portion of the savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 or 2024. Additionally, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The company sells its products and services through direct-to-consumer, distribution, key account management, inside sales, and e-commerce.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, Solventum's revenue was $8.25 billion, an increase of 0.70% compared to the previous year's $8.20 billion. Earnings were $479.00 million, a decrease of -64.41%.\n\n**2025 Performance:**\n• In the most recent fiscal year (2025), Solventum reported approximately $8.4 billion in sales, representing organic growth of 2.8%. Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) for 2025 landed at $6.02, beating early-year analyst expectations.\n• SOLV earnings for the last quarter are 1.50 USD per share, whereas the estimation was 1.43 USD resulting in a 4.89% surprise. The estimated earnings for the next quarter are 1.50 USD per share.\n• Solventum Corporation EBITDA is 1.55 B USD, and current EBITDA margin is 19.72%.\n\n**Debt Reduction:**\nThe company has been exceptionally aggressive in deleveraging. Utilizing the proceeds from the Purification & Filtration sale, Solventum reduced its total debt from $8.3 billion to approximately $4.2 billion by the end of 2025, bringing its debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 1.9x—well ahead of its 2026 target. Operating margins have remained resilient at roughly 24%, despite the costs associated with rebranding and building out an independent sales force.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Several macro factors are favoring Solventum in 2026. The aging global population is driving higher surgical volumes and chronic wound occurrences.\n• Share Buybacks: The $1 billion share repurchase program announced in late 2025 is expected to provide a floor for the stock price and boost EPS in the coming quarters. AI Monetization: Continued adoption of autonomous coding could lead to margin expansion within the HIS segment, as software revenue carries significantly higher margins than physical medical devices.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• Risk one circles back to the company's separation from 3M. There are still numerous items on the list including ERP system conversions, distribution centers cut-overs, and product re-branding that can impact both sales and margins. There are a total of 200 TSA agreements between SOLV and MMM and SOLV is about one-third of the way through those, so FY 2026 will be a big deciding year for the spin off.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nIt leads the global market in advanced wound care, driven by the V.A.C. therapy system. Solventum holds the #1 position in advanced wound care but faces pricing pressure in general surgical supplies. Solventum's strength is its premium brand positioning in dental solutions.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Solventum's global sales were predominantly driven by the United States, accounting for 55% of total revenue. The remaining 45% of sales were generated from international markets, indicating a strong North American focus with a notable global reach.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nMedical Surgical: Becton Dickinson, Cardinal Health, Medline, Smith & Nephew, Medela, Mölnlycke, Coloplast, Convatec, Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, GE HealthCare Technologies, Koninklijke Philips, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker. Dental Solutions: Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Straumann, Align Technology, Ivoclar. Health Information Systems: Optum, Microsoft (Nuance), Epic, Cerner, Athena, and various startups.\n\nWhile smaller than giants like Medtronic, Solventum's 18% net margins often exceed those of its larger peers, making it a more efficient cash-flow generator. A closer look reveals a significantly lower P/E valuation and modest revenue growth compared to these leaders. However, it also shows comparatively weaker profitability and free cash flow generation, suggesting its future upside may hinge on improving margins and sustained operational execution. SOLV's 8.0% operating margin is modest, reflecting tariff pressures, higher than most peers yet below JNJ's 26.2% from diversified high-margin pharmaceuticals.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity:**\n• Solventum has acquired Acera for an upfront cash payment of $725 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and up to $125 million in contingent cash payments based on the achievement of certain future milestones. Solventum announced today it has completed the acquisition of Acera Surgical, a privately held bioscience company focused on developing and commercializing fully engineered materials for regenerative wound care. The transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 2026 and accretive to adjusted EPS beginning in 2027.\n\n• Solventum has completed the sale of its Purification & Filtration business to Thermo Fisher Scientific for $4.0 billion in cash. The company will receive net proceeds of $3.4 billion, primarily allocated to debt reduction.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\n• Solventum announced a strategic partnership with SprintRay, a leading provider of chairside 3D dental printing, to meet the needs of dentists with in-office chairside 3D printed crowns, inlays, onlays and more.\n\n## 12.

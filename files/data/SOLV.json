Headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota, it operates three core segments: **Dental Solutions** (27% of sales: consumables, equipment for restorative, ortho, and digital dentistry); **Healthcare Solutions** (50% of sales: advanced wound care, oral care, health IT, and surgical performance); and **Purification and Filtration** (23% of sales: membranes/filters for biopharma, food/beverage, and municipal water purification).  \n\nWith ~15,000 employees and operations in 80+ countries, Solventum generated $8.0 billion in FY2023 pro forma revenue (pre-spin data). It holds leadership in niche markets like advanced wound care (e.g., negative pressure wound therapy via V.A.C. system) and bioprocessing filtration. Post-spin, management emphasizes margin expansion through productivity, R&D (3-4% of sales), and portfolio rationalization, targeting mid-single-digit organic growth. The company benefits from a debt-light balance sheet ($2.5B net debt post-spin) and recurring revenue from consumables (~70% of sales). Challenges include litigation overhang from 3M PFAS/earplugs and macroeconomic pressures on elective procedures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 FY2024 Earnings (Reported October 29, 2024)**: Revenue $1.68B (-4.5% YoY reported, +1.2% organic growth); Adj.

Resilient consumables model weathers macro; spin-off unlocks value.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $80/share (30% upside; DCF-based at 8% WACC, 4% perpetual growth; peers avg +20% premium). Catalysts: Q4 earnings (Jan 2025), R&D launches. Risks: Recession hits Dental (10-15% downside). Hold if risk-averse. \n\n*Sources: Company 10-Q (Oct 29, 2024), Earnings transcripts (Seeking Alpha), Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg (prices), Analyst reports (JPMorgan, BofA Oct 2024 \"Overweight\").

Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, the company operates through two primary segments: Inpatient Rehabilitation, which accounts for ~85% of revenue and includes 158 IRFs across 37 states and Puerto Rico as of Q3 2024, and Home Health & Hospice, comprising 270 home health agencies and 88 hospice agencies in 24 states. Encompass Health focuses on post-acute care, emphasizing specialized rehabilitation services with a patient-centered model that integrates advanced therapies, technology (e.g., robotics, AI-driven outcomes tracking), and interdisciplinary teams. The company discharges ~95% of patients to their homes, outperforming industry averages, and maintains high quality scores (e.g., 4.5+ stars on CMS ratings for most facilities). With a network serving over 120,000 IRF patients annually and leveraging joint ventures (JVs) with health systems for ~50% of its IRFs, Encompass Health benefits from the growing demand for rehabilitation amid an aging U.S. population and shift to value-based care. As of November 1, 2024, EHC's stock price is $95.72 (closing price from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq), with a market capitalization of $9.51 billion.

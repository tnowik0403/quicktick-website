(ALMU3.SA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, sourced from B3 exchange and Yahoo Finance):**\n- **Closing Price**: R$ 7.85\n- **Market Capitalization**: R$ 328.5 million\n- **52-Week Range**: R$ 6.50 - R$ 12.30\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 45,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 8.2x\n- **Dividend Yield**: 4.1%\n\n## Company Overview\nAlumus S.A. is a leading Brazilian manufacturer of extruded aluminum profiles, specializing in high-value-added products for the construction, industrial, automotive, and infrastructure sectors. Founded in 1994 and headquartered in São Paulo, the company operates two production plants in São Paulo state with a combined annual capacity of approximately 45,000 tons. Alumus focuses on customized aluminum solutions, including structural profiles for facades, windows, doors, and industrial applications like machinery components and automotive parts. It serves both domestic and export markets, with exports accounting for ~10% of revenue, primarily to Latin America and Europe.\n\nThe company differentiates through vertical integration, including aluminum billet production via recycling (70% recycled content), which supports sustainability goals and cost efficiency. In 2023, Alumus reported revenue of R$ 850 million (up 12% YoY), driven by construction recovery post-pandemic. It holds a niche in premium segments like solar panel frames and high-end architectural systems. With Brazil's construction sector rebounding (IBGE data shows 5.2% growth in H1 2024), Alumus is positioned to capitalize on urbanization and infrastructure investments via the Novo PAC program. However, it faces cyclical risks from commodity price volatility and competition from imports.

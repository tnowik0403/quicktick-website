(CHPT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $1.38\n- Market Capitalization: $596.5 million\n- 52-Week Range: $1.21 - $2.44\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 20.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CHPT) is a leading provider of networked charging solutions for electric vehicles (EVs), operating the largest charging network in North America with over 70% market share in Level 2 AC charging ports as of Q2 FY2025. Founded in 2007 and public since 2021 via SPAC merger, the company offers a comprehensive platform including hardware (Level 2 and DC fast chargers), cloud-based software for network management, billing, and analytics, and services for fleet operators, commercial sites, and residential users. ChargePoint's ecosystem connects over 1 million charging ports globally (64% in North America), enabling seamless roaming, payments, and uptime monitoring via its app serving 1.4 million drivers. Revenue is split ~60% hardware, 40% subscriptions/network services. The company targets commercial/fleet (70% revenue) and residential markets amid EV adoption. Challenges include persistent losses amid high capex for network expansion, but tailwinds from U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding ($7.5B for charging) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits position it for growth. FY2024 revenue was $507M (down 6% YoY), with Q2 FY2025 revenue at $103M (verified from Sept 24, 2024 earnings release). Gross margins improved to 22.4% in Q2 FY2025 from negative prior year, reflecting cost cuts including 15% workforce reduction in March 2024.

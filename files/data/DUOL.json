In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Exceptional execution (DAU/revenue momentum), AI tailwinds outweigh valuation premium amid edtech rebound. Hold if risk-averse (volatility from growth stocks).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $320 (15-20% upside from $278). Based on 12x FY25E revenue ($900M consensus) + 30% DAU CAGR; DCF assumes 25% rev growth to 2028, 15% terminal EBITDA margin (peers: Chegg 8x, BYON 2x adjusted for growth). Moderate risk: Diversified revenue, profitability buffer.",

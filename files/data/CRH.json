Founded in 1970, it operates across three main geographies—Americas (primary revenue driver at ~75%), Europe, and Asia Pacific—serving construction, infrastructure, and commercial markets. CRH produces and distributes essential materials like aggregates (crushed stone, sand, gravel), asphalt, cement, ready-mixed concrete, precast concrete products, and provides related services such as paving and construction contracting. With ~80,000 employees across 3,900+ locations, CRH emphasizes vertically integrated operations for cost efficiency and sustainability. In 2023, it generated €36.2 billion in revenue, focusing on high-return M&A, organic growth via infrastructure demand, and shareholder returns (e.g., €1.5 billion buybacks). The company benefits from diversified end-markets (non-residential ~60%, infrastructure ~25%, residential ~15%) and a shift toward North America post-2021 US listing, positioning it for US infrastructure boom under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Challenges include cyclical construction exposure and raw material volatility, but strong balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~1.0x) supports resilience.

Growth Strategy\n\nKenvue has demonstrated an ability to drive organic growth through value realization, which includes price increases and a favorable product mix. In the third quarter of 2024, value realization contributed 2.5% to organic growth, stemming from a combination of carry-over pricing and new price actions. This strategy is expected to continue contributing to revenue growth. The company is leveraging productivity and efficiency benefits from its \"Our Vue Forward\" initiative, aiming to deliver $350 million in annual savings by 2026. These savings are being reinvested behind its iconic brands to foster sustainable and profitable growth, driving market share gains in segments like Self Care and broad-based growth in Essential Health.\n\nWe expect Kenvue to focus on its 15 priority brands (including Tylenol, Nicorette, Listerine, and Zyrtec) to drive future growth. We forecast the firm to spend roughly 3% of sales on research and development, on par with some of its wide-moat competitors, to launch innovative products.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nWalmart Inc. alone accounted for approximately 16% of Kenvue's consolidated net sales in 2023, while the next five largest customers (CVS Health Corporation, The Kroger Co., Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Target Corporation, and Amazon.com, Inc.) collectively accounted for approximately 25% of consolidated net sales.\n\n**Major Retail Partners:**\n- Walmart Inc.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results:**\nKenvue posted revenues of $3.9 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.56%. Kenvue came out with quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.27 per share.\n\n**TTM Financial Metrics:**\nThe trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue of Kenvue (KVUE) is $15,455,000,000. The trailing twelve months (TTM) net income of Kenvue (KVUE) is $1,030,000,000. The gross profit of Kenvue (KVUE) is $8,959,000,000 on a trailing twelve months (TTM) basis. The operating income of Kenvue (KVUE) is $1,841,000,000.\n\nIn 2024, Kenvue's revenue was $15.46 billion, an increase of 0.07% compared to the previous year's $15.44 billion. Earnings were $1.03 billion, a decrease of -38.10%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Major Headwinds:**\n- **Tylenol Litigation:** Kenvue faces significant regulatory and reputational headwinds as the Trump administration asserted, without evidence, a definitive link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in pain reliever Tylenol, and autism during pregnancy. This represents a direct challenge to one of Kenvue's most important revenue drivers within its Self-Care segment. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Kenvue, claiming that the company \"deceptively\" marketed Tylenol to pregnant women and that the medication is tied to an increased risk of autism. Kenvue said it will \"vigorously defend\" against the claims.\n\n- **Store Brand Competition:** Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Macro drivers like an aging population and premiumization of health care will act as tailwinds for all of Kenvue's brands.\n- Focus on innovation and emerging markets positions the company for sustained demand, premium pricing, and long-term expansion beyond mature regions.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nEarly signs of progress include sequential improvement in Neutrogena Face consumption, continued market share gains for Tylenol (12 consecutive quarters), and strong performance in EMEA and Latin American markets.\n\nStill, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Direct Competitors:**\nIn the over-the-counter pharmaceutical segment, the company competes directly with Procter & Gamble (PG) through brands like Vicks and Pepto-Bismol, Bayer AG's consumer health division with Aspirin and Aleve, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) consumer healthcare with brands like Advil and Sensodyne. In skincare and beauty, Kenvue's Neutrogena and Aveeno brands compete against Unilever (UL) with Dove and Vaseline, L'Oréal's mass market brands, and Procter & Gamble's Olay franchise. The oral care segment sees competition between Listerine and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) products, as well as Procter & Gamble's Crest and Oral-B brands.\n\nAccording to 12 analysts, the average rating for KVUE stock is \"Buy.\" The 12-month stock price target is $20.0, which is an increase of 16.28% from the latest price.\n\n## 11.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Changes:**\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE), the world's largest pure-play consumer health company, announced significant leadership changes and strategic initiatives. The company has appointed Kirk Perry as Interim CEO, replacing Thibaut Mongon, effective immediately. The Board has initiated a comprehensive strategic review to unlock shareholder value, considering portfolio optimization and operational improvements.\n\n**Earnings Performance:**\nKenvue Inc. is going to release the next earnings report on Feb 5, 2026.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Current Analyst Consensus:**\nAccording to 13 analysts, Kenvue (KVUE) has a Buy consensus rating as of Jan 2, 2026. 13 analysts have given Kenvue (KVUE) a consensus rating of Buy while the Kenvue (KVUE) price prediction in 2026 is $20.27\n\n**Valuation Assessment:**\nKVUE is trading at a 653% premium. Price: $17.12, Fair Value: $25.00\n\n**Investment Considerations:**\n- **Positives:** Strong brand portfolio, pending acquisition at significant premium, stable dividend yield\n- **Risks:** Ongoing Tylenol litigation, store brand competition, recent earnings decline, integration uncertainty with Kimberly-Clark\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 6.5/10**\n\nGiven the pending acquisition by Kimberly-Clark at $21.01 per share (representing a 22% premium to current trading levels), the stock presents a relatively attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for moderate risk portfolios. However, significant litigation risks, declining organic growth, and integration uncertainties prevent a higher rating.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $20.50**\n\nThis valuation reflects the acquisition price minus a small discount for deal completion risk and regulatory approval uncertainty. The merger provides a clear exit strategy for current shareholders, making the stock suitable for portfolios seeking moderate upside with defined risk parameters.",

(AGO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $182.50\n- **Market Capitalization**: $10.52B\n- **52-Week Range**: $121.25 - $188.65\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 6.25\n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.75% (annualized $3.20/share)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nAssured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) is the world's largest financial guaranty insurer, providing credit enhancement products primarily for public finance and infrastructure debt. Headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, with key U.S. operations in New York, AGO and its subsidiaries (e.g., Assured Guaranty Municipal Holdings Inc.) insure municipal bonds, public infrastructure projects, and select structured finance obligations. The company mitigates default risk for investors by guaranteeing timely principal and interest payments, enabling lower borrowing costs for issuers like state/local governments and utilities. In 2023, AGO insured over $20B in new par value, dominating the U.S. public finance guaranty market. Its business model emphasizes conservative underwriting, high capital ratios (e.g., 450%+ risk-to-capital under RPS), and shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks ($300M+ authorized in 2024). AGO benefits from structural tailwinds like U.S. infrastructure spending (IIJA) but navigates cyclical bond issuance tied to interest rates. With $5.0B in shareholder equity (Q2 2024), AGO maintains pristine ratings (AA/Stable by S&P) and focuses on high-margin, low-risk global expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 29, 2024)**: Net income attributable to AGO of $135M ($2.87/share, up 8% YoY); gross written premiums (GWP) $189M; present value of new insurance written (PVNIW) $293M (up 20% YoY).

(MRK), known internationally as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada, is a global leader in biopharmaceuticals, vaccines, and animal health products. Headquartered in Rahway, New Jersey, the company discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative therapies focused on oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care, cardiovascular, diabetes, and consumer health (spun off as Organon in 2021). Merck's blockbuster portfolio is dominated by Keytruda (pembrolizumab), the world's top-selling drug with ~$25B in 2023 sales, treating multiple cancers via PD-1 inhibition. Other key franchises include Gardasil (HPV vaccine), animal health (via Merck Animal Health), and incretin therapies like Winrevair. With ~70,000 employees, Merck operates in ~140 countries, emphasizing R&D investment (~$30B cumulative over 5 years) in next-gen modalities like ADCs, radiopharma, and mRNA vaccines. Recent Q2 2024 results showed resilience amid patent cliffs, with oncology growth offsetting vaccine declines.

Chewy's business model emphasizes a subscription-based Autoship program, which drives ~75% of net sales through recurring deliveries, fostering customer loyalty with personalized recommendations, free shipping on orders over $49, and 24/7 U.S.-based customer service. Beyond retail, Chewy has expanded into pet healthcare via its pharmacy (one of the largest U.S. pet pharmacies) and Chewy Health services, including telehealth and vet care. As of Q2 2024, Chewy serves nearly 25 million active customers, processing millions of orders annually from four fulfillment centers and sponsored branded stores.

(CNDT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nConduent Incorporated (NYSE: CNDT) is a business process services (BPS) provider specializing in technology-enabled solutions for government and commercial clients. Originally spun off from Xerox in 2017, Conduent historically offered services in customer experience management (CXM), payment integrity, and government administration. As of October 7, 2024, the company announced a transformative restructuring: it entered definitive agreements to divest its North America Commercial Segments—CXM and Healthcare Revenue Technologies (including payment integrity)—to affiliates of New Mountain Capital for $95 million in upfront cash (subject to adjustments) plus a 20% equity interest in the buyer's parent company. This leaves Conduent as a pure-play Government business process services provider, focusing on three core segments: Commercial Government (state and local government administration), Transportation (tolling and mobility solutions), and Defense (IT and mission support). Key offerings include benefits administration (e.g., Medicaid fiscal agent services), child support enforcement, vital records, tolling systems, and defense logistics. With over 16,000 employees and operations in 20+ countries, Conduent serves mission-critical government programs, emphasizing automation, AI, and digital transformation to improve efficiency and compliance. In FY2023, ~70% of revenue was from government clients, with high recurring revenue (80%+ multi-year contracts). Post-divestiture (expected Q1 2025 close), Conduent anticipates $1.2B+ in annualized run-rate revenue, $130M+ adjusted EBITDA, and deleveraging to net debt/EBITDA <1.0x, positioning it for stable cash flows amid government digitization trends.

Moderate risk from execution/debt, but deleveraging mitigates. Upside skewed for growth portfolios.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $7.50/share** (85% upside from $4.05)  \n- DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth): $7.00-$8.00.  \n- Comps: 7x 2025E EBITDA ($130M) implies $900M EV → $6.50/share + net cash.  \n- Catalysts: Q3 earnings (Nov 2024), deal close (Q1 2025). Hold if risk-averse; buy dips.",

(NASDAQ: PLMR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Verified from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.palomarspecialty.com), Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha, Aug 5, 2024), Bloomberg, Reuters articles (latest Sep 2024), Barron's discussions.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPalomar Holdings, Inc. (PLMR) is a specialty property insurance holding company founded in 2013 and headquartered in La Jolla, California. The company designs and underwrites innovative insurance products targeting residential and commercial customers exposed to perils such as earthquakes, wildfires, tropical cyclones/hurricanes, severe convective storms (hail/wind), and floods. Palomar operates through three main segments: Residential, Commercial, and Specialty (including crop). It writes policies via admitted carriers in all 50 U.S. states, with a focus on underserved markets like high-hazard zones where traditional insurers retreat due to climate risks.\n\nPLMR leverages proprietary technology and data analytics for precise underwriting, enabling rapid scaling during catastrophe (cat) events. As of Q2 2024, it managed $1.2B in gross written premiums (GWP) annualized run-rate, with a combined ratio of 88.7% reflecting strong profitability. The company's growth is fueled by geographic expansion (e.g., Texas, Florida post-Hurricane Ian), product diversification, and a robust reinsurance program. PLMR has grown GWP at a 5-year CAGR of ~50%, positioning it as a nimble player in the $100B+ U.S. specialty property & casualty (P&C) market, capitalizing on rising climate-driven demand while maintaining a lean expense ratio through tech efficiency.

Rationale: 50%+ GWP CAGR, sub-90% ratios, cat resilience (low Helene/Milton hit), undervalued vs. peers (20% upside to consensus PT). Moderate risk from cats/reinsurance, offset by $500M+ surplus.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $125/share (27% upside). DCF-based (25% GWP CAGR to 2026, 12% discount rate, 5% terminal; aligns with BofA/analyst models). Targets strong growth (EPS +30% 2025E) with moderate volatility. Hold if risk-averse; accumulate on dips < $95.",

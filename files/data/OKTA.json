Existing Products/Services\n\nOkta operates through two main platforms:\n\n**Okta Workforce Identity Platform:**\nIt provides Universal Directory, a cloud-based system of record to store and secure user, application, and device profiles for an organization; Lifecycle Management enables IT organizations or developers to manage a user's identity throughout its lifecycle; Okta Identity Governance provides identity access management and identity governance solutions; Advanced Server Access offers access management to secure cloud infrastructure; Okta Privileged Access enables organizations to reduce risk with unified access and governance management for on-premises and cloud resources; and Okta Workforce Identity Workflows.\n\n**Customer Identity Cloud (Auth0):**\nCustomer Identity Cloud (powered by Auth0): This developer-centric platform allows companies to embed secure login experiences into their own applications and websites.\n\nOkta sells six services, including a single-sign-on service that allows users to log into a variety of systems using a single centralized process. For example, the company claims the ability to log into Gmail, Workday, Salesforce and Slack with one login.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nOkta is heavily investing in AI-driven identity security solutions:\n\n**AI Agent Security Framework:**\nIdentity Threat Protection with Okta AI (ITP) continuously monitors user activity and employs behavioral analytics to identify anomalous behavior and trigger automated remediations to maintain security posture throughout active sessions. Cross App Access (XAA) extends OAuth to secure agent-driven and app-to-app interactions across the enterprise.\n\nCross App Access (XAA) (Early Access available January 2026): XAA is a new, open protocol that brings app-to-app and AI agent connections under Okta's identity control, giving you centralized visibility, policy-driven security, and safer integrations.\n\n**Digital Identity Verification:**\nTucked into the very end of the announcement is Okta's plan to add digital identity verification, with early access in Q4 2026. Okta will also soon offer identity verification with government-issued digital IDs, starting with mobile driver's licenses (mDLs).\n\nThe final announcement, planned for the company's 2027 fiscal year, is Verifiable Digital Credentials, an open standard offering that will allow organizations to issue and verify tamper-proof, reusable identity data such as government IDs or certifications. VDCs, when launched, will allow individuals to digitally prove their identity or eligibility across applications while limiting exposure to AI-driven fraud and deepfake threats.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nOkta's growth strategy centers on three key pillars:\n\n**Identity Security Fabric:**\nAn identity security fabric is an architecture that gives IT and Security teams a unified control plane that manages every identity type—human and non-human—to help prevent security gaps. This approach eliminates \"swivel chair security\" by unifying governance, privileged access, and identity management, ensuring that a policy applied to a human employee can also be enforced for an autonomous agent.\n\n**Land-and-Expand Model:**\nOkta's \"land-and-expand\" strategy relies on winning a customer for basic SSO and then upselling advanced modules like Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Identity Governance. By early 2026, the company has successfully transitioned many of its 19,000+ customers into multi-product suites, increasing its average contract value (ACV).\n\n**AI-First Approach:**\n\"2026 will be the year vertical AI agents disrupt enterprise incumbents. If 2025 was marked by an awareness in the market of the potential for AI agents then 2026 is the year we will see them come into action executing end to end processes and challenging incumbents along the way with new, more efficient, and more secure workflows.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nWe serve over 17,000 customers, and an increasing percentage come from large-scale organizations with high daily transaction volumes and several customization requirements. Around the world in 2026, over 26,720 companies have started using Okta as identity-access-management tool. Companies using Okta for identity-access-management are majorly from United States with 17,570 customers.\n\n**Notable Enterprise Clients:**\nThe list of companies using Okta consists of some big names that include LinkedIn, Groupon.com, Typeform, Travelex, Hubspot, Better, and Yousign.\n\nOrganizations such as Labcorp, Wayfair, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services United States, Apple and CVS are recorded users of Okta Identity Cloud for Identity and Access Management (IAM).\n\nFrom the data gathered in Zoominfo, Walmart, Amazon, UnitedHealth Group, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, are using the Okta technology.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Financial Performance:**\nFor the full year fiscal 2026, the Company now expects: Total revenue of $2.875 billion to $2.885 billion, representing a growth rate of 10% to 11% year-over-year; Non-GAAP operating income of $730 million to $740 million, which yields a non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 26%; Non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $3.33 to $3.38\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company expects: Total revenue of $728 million to $730 million, representing a growth rate of 9% to 10% year-over-year; Current RPO of $2.260 billion to $2.265 billion, representing a growth rate of 10% year-over-year\n\n**Cash Flow and Margins:**\nMargins: Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded dramatically to 24-26%, up from single digits just two years ago. In late 2025, Okta achieved a 29% FCF margin, generating over $210 million in a single quarter.\n\nThe Buyback Factor: With over $2.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet and no immediate debt maturities, the $1 billion buyback is funded entirely from the company's massive FCF engine.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\nThe primary battle for Okta remains the rivalry with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) product. The Microsoft Threat: Microsoft often bundles identity security for \"free\" or at a low cost within its E5 enterprise licenses. This remains Okta's greatest headwind in the mid-market.\n\nPast security incidents have impacted customer trust, necessitating a strong focus on demonstrating robust security. Okta's past security incidents, including breaches in 2022 and 2024, have presented opportunities for competitors to highlight their security strengths and potentially impact Okta's market position and customer trust.\n\nMacro Economic Pressures: High interest rates and tighter IT budgets in early 2026 have led to longer sales cycles and more scrutiny on \"premium\" security products.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nThe global IAM market is poised for substantial growth, projected to expand from $20.30 billion in 2024 to $65.30 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 18.20%. Okta's total addressable market is estimated at $80 billion, with current market penetration at approximately 3%, indicating significant untapped potential.\n\nAccording to Okta's \"AI at Work 2025\" survey of 260 executives, 91% of organizations are already using AI agents across nearly five distinct use cases on average. Yet only 10% have a well-developed strategy for managing these non-human identities, representing a massive opportunity.\n\nGeopolitics: As a U.S.-based company, Okta benefits from \"friend-shoring\" as Western governments move away from security providers with ties to adversarial nations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nOkta has market share of 41.56% in identity-access-management market. However, this appears to be within a specific segment, as broader market data shows In the IT Management Software category, Okta has a market share of about 0.4%.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nThe top three of Okta's competitors in the Identity And Access Management category are OneLogin with 43.33%, Gigya with 2.98%, Duo Security with 2.82% market share.\n\nMicrosoft has a rating of 4.4 stars with 724 reviews. Okta has a rating of 4.6 stars with 1106 reviews.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD):**\nOkta's primary challenge comes from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). Entra ID benefits significantly from its deep integration within the Microsoft ecosystem, particularly with Microsoft 365 and Azure. This integration strategy presents a substantial hurdle for Okta's market penetration.\n\n**Neutrality Advantage:**\nThe \"Neutrality\" Moat: Okta's competitive edge is its independence. As enterprises adopt multi-cloud strategies (using AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure simultaneously), they often prefer a neutral identity provider that doesn't prioritize one ecosystem over another.\n\n**Other Competitors:**\nThe company has 192 active competitors, including 33 funded and 29 that have exited. Its top competitors include companies like RSA, Auth0 and Ping Identity.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\nOkta's most recent acquisition is Axiom Security, a Platform offering identity and access management software, acquired in August 2025. The most recent acquisition was Axiom Security, an identity and access management software platform founded in 2021, located in Tel Aviv, and acquired in August 2025.\n\nThe financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but according to Israeli media reports, the deal may value Axiom somewhere around $75m (£56m).\n\n**Historical M&A:**\nIn March 2021, Okta signed a definitive agreement to acquire Auth0 for $6.5 billion. The deal closed in May 2021. Okta's largest acquisition to date was in 2021, when it acquired Auth0 for $6.5B.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nIt expanded its partnership with Palo Alto Networks in July with new integrations that will help partners deliver a unified security architecture via the Okta Workforce Identity and Palo Alto Prisma Access Browser.\n\nWith support from industry leaders like Automation Anywhere, AWS, Boomi, Box, Glean, Google Cloud, Grammarly, Miro, Salesforce, and WRITER, XAA shifts control from individual applications to the identity layer\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**$1 Billion Share Buyback Program (January 2026):**\nOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ: OKTA), the leading independent identity partner, today announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $1 billion of its Class A Common Stock, effective immediately. By authorizing a $1 billion share repurchase program on January 5, the company's board committed to retiring nearly 7% of its outstanding Class A common stock.\n\n**Board Additions:**\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA), the leading independent identity partner, has strengthened its board of directors with the appointment of David Schellhase and Mary Agnes (Maggie) Wilderotter, effective August 13, 2025. CEO Todd McKinnon highlighted their proven advisory experience in scaling growth companies in complex business and technology environments.\n\n**Gartner Recognition:**\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA) was named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management for the ninth consecutive year and a Customers' Choice in Gartner Peer Insights: Access Management for the sixth consecutive year. Gartner evaluated 13 vendors on 15 criteria and placed Okta in the Leaders quadrant for its ability to execute and completeness of vision.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Okta's financial profile in early 2026 reflects a company that has successfully pivoted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"profitable growth.\"\n- Strong free cash flow generation with 29% FCF margins\n- Leading position in identity security with first-mover advantage in AI agent governance\n- Expanding total addressable market ($80B) with only 3% current penetration\n- Strategic positioning at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity trends\n\n**Investment Challenges:**\n- Intense competition from Microsoft's bundled offerings\n- Past security incidents affecting brand trust\n- Macroeconomic pressures on IT budgets\n- Execution risk in expanding AI product portfolio\n\n**Analyst Targets:**\nOKTA's current price target is $113.62. The predicted value for Okta Inc (OKTA) in 2026 is set at an average of $234.90. Estimates vary from a peak of $282.35 to a trough of $187.45, indicating an +180.85% surge from the present price of $83.64.\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.2/10**\n\nGiven Okta's strong financial performance, leadership position in identity management, strategic pivot to AI-driven security solutions, and significant market opportunity, I assign a buy rating of 7.2/10. The company demonstrates solid fundamentals with expanding margins, strong cash generation, and a compelling growth narrative around AI agent security. However, competitive pressures from Microsoft and execution risks in new product areas warrant caution.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $125-135**\n\nBased on the company's transition to profitable growth, expanding market opportunity, strategic positioning in AI security, and strong cash generation capabilities, I estimate a fair value range of $125-135 per share for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk appetite. This represents approximately 38-49% upside potential from current levels, reflecting both the growth opportunities and competitive challenges facing the company.",

Founded in 1983 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company operates in two main segments: **Telematics** (hardware devices like mobile data terminals (MDTs), asset gateways, and rugged video telematics) and **Software & Services** (SaaS platform Pondera for data analytics, workflow automation, and application development). CalAmp serves industries including transportation & logistics (70% of revenue), government/public safety, utilities, and construction. Its solutions leverage 4G LTE, satellite, and emerging 5G/LoRaWAN networks for real-time visibility, compliance, and efficiency gains. With ~1,400 employees and operations in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, CalAmp focuses on recurring SaaS revenue (targeting 50%+ of total) amid a shift from one-time hardware sales.

Hold for debt reduction milestones.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $8.50 (30% upside from $6.57) – DCF-based (8% discount rate, 5% terminal growth, FY2026 EBITDA $20M); assumes 10% revenue growth, 30% SaaS mix, 2x leverage. Strong growth upside requires flawless execution; moderate risk profile limits to speculative allocation (<5% portfolio).",

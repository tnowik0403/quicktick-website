Its Just-in-Time (JIT) Funding model provides real-time authorization decisions, risk controls, and funding, reducing fraud and float costs.\n\nKey to its value proposition is the shift from legacy card networks to API-driven \"modern card issuing,\" which supports use cases like buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), gig economy payouts, expense management, and B2B payments. Marqeta processes billions in Total Processing Volume (TPV) annually, serving high-growth clients in digital wallets, lending, and e-commerce.

Rationale: TPV inflection underway (Q3 guide +22% QoQ), enterprise shift de-risks growth, but revenue headwinds and valuation (EV/2025 Sales ~3x) temper enthusiasm vs. fintech peers. Moderate risk appetite suits portfolio; strong growth upside if execution hits (20%+ CAGR).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $7.50 (43% upside from $5.25). Based on 8x 2026 EV/Sales (consensus $1.2B revenue) + DCF assuming 18% TPV CAGR, 50% take rate stabilization (Bloomberg analyst avg. target $6.80, high $10).",

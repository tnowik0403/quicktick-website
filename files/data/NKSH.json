(NASDAQ: NKSH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $30.84 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $225.07 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $23.89 - $36.79  \n**P/E Ratio (TTM):** 11.67  \n**Dividend Yield:** 4.22% (annualized $1.20/share, ex-dividend September 6, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNational Bankshares, Inc. (NKSH) is a bank holding company headquartered in Blacksburg, Virginia, founded in 1886. It operates primarily through its subsidiary, National Bank of Blacksburg (the Bank), serving customers in southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee via 24 full-service branches, a loan production office in Roanoke, VA, and digital banking channels. The company focuses on community banking, offering commercial, retail, and mortgage banking products alongside trust and wealth management services.\n\nNKSH emphasizes relationship-based lending, with a loan portfolio dominated by commercial real estate (CRE, ~50%), commercial loans (~25%), and real estate construction (~10%). Deposits fund operations, with non-interest-bearing deposits at ~30% of total. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $3.2 billion, loans at $2.38 billion, and deposits at $2.88 billion. The bank maintains a conservative profile: high Texas ratio (<10%), strong capital ratios (Tier 1 leverage 10.5%), and a focus on low-risk, local markets like higher education (Virginia Tech proximity) and manufacturing/agriculture.\n\nRecent challenges include net interest margin (NIM) compression from rising rates, but NKSH benefits from a sticky deposit base (low-cost core deposits ~70%) and consistent dividends (52-year streak). It differentiates via personalized service in underserved rural/suburban areas, avoiding aggressive expansion.

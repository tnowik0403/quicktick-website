(NASDAQ: AXTI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close - Verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $2.85         |\n| Market Cap      | $126.6M       |\n| 52-Week High    | $5.48         |\n| 52-Week Low     | $2.02         |\n| Avg.

These substrates are critical components in high-performance applications across wireless communications (e.g., 5G base stations), data centers (AI-driven silicon photonics and optical transceivers), fiber optics, satellite communications, solar cells, LEDs, lasers, and power electronics. AXT operates primarily through two segments: AXT Silicon Carbide (SiC) Wafers (emerging focus) and its core GaAs (gallium arsenide), InP (indium phosphide), and Ge (germanium) substrates produced at fabs in Fremont, CA; Ganzhou, China; and Beijing, China.\n\nThe company emphasizes high-quality, large-diameter substrates to meet surging demand from AI data centers, where InP is key for high-speed lasers in 800G+ optical modules. AXT serves a global customer base with ~90% revenue from Asia. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 7, 2024), revenue hit $27.7M (up 11% YoY), driven by InP sales for datacom, though GaAs remained soft. Challenges include U.S.-China trade tensions impacting its China operations (75% of production capacity). AXT is pivoting to SiC for EV/power semis and expanding InP capacity to capture AI tailwinds.

Strong AI/InP upside offsets China risks; Q3 beat potential + SiC catalyst = 50-100% growth runway. Moderate risk via diversification.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $5.50 (92% upside from $2.85). Based on 2025E revenue $140M (25% CAGR), 20x EV/Sales (peer avg), 15% gross margins improving to 25%. DCF assumes 30% InP growth, SiC $20M ramp. Entry for growth portfolios. \n\n*Sources: Q2 Earnings (SEC 8-K, Aug 7); Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (Oct 11); Seeking Alpha transcripts; Yole Intelligence reports; LightCounting AI photonics forecast (Sept 2024).*",

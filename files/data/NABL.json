Its platform integrates remote monitoring and management (RMM), data protection, security, patching, and professional services into a unified, subscription-based model. With a focus on simplicity and scalability, N-able serves over 25,000 MSPs globally, which in turn manage IT for millions of end-user seats.

Operating in the $50B+ MSP software market, N-able differentiates via its partner-first ecosystem, avoiding direct competition with MSPs by not reselling hardware or services.

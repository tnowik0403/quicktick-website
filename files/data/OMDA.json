(NASDAQ: OMDA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $49.25\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.82 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $37.10 - $73.40\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 52.3\n- **Forward P/E**: 35.1\n\n## Company Overview\nOddity Tech Ltd. (OMDA) is an Israel-based consumer tech company revolutionizing the beauty and wellness industries through AI-driven personalization and data science. Founded in 2013 and public since July 2023 via IPO, Oddity operates a portfolio of digital-first brands, primarily IL MAKIAGE (virtual-try-on makeup) and SpoiledChild (AI-personalized skincare and supplements). Its proprietary tech stack—including AI algorithms, machine learning for shade-matching, and behavioral analytics—powers a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model that skips traditional retail intermediaries. Customers engage via interactive online quizzes and virtual mirrors, generating hyper-personalized recommendations from millions of data points.\n\nThe company emphasizes a \"test-and-serve\" flywheel: rigorous product testing on diverse panels (e.g., 25,000+ for IL MAKIAGE shades) ensures high conversion (25-30% quiz-to-purchase) and repeat rates (40%+). Revenue is 98% e-commerce, with 80% from North America. As of Q2 2024, Oddity serves 1.5M+ active customers, boasting gross margins >73%. Expansion into wellness via SpoiledChild (launched 2022) and new brand ORONKI (haircare, 2024 beta) targets a $600B+ global beauty market. Backed by a debt-free balance sheet ($250M+ cash), Oddity invests in R&D (15% of revenue) for AI enhancements and international scaling, positioning it as a disruptor against legacy incumbents reliant on mass-market formulas.

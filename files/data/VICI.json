Formed in 2017 as a spin-off from Caesars Entertainment, VICI has grown into one of the largest gaming-focused REITs, with a portfolio of 93 assets across the United States and Canada as of Q2 2024. These include iconic properties like Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, and Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, regional casinos such as Harrah's New Orleans, and non-gaming experiential assets like the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas and Bowlero bowling centers.\n\nThe company's business model revolves around long-term, triple-net leases with investment-grade or well-capitalized tenants, providing stable, inflation-protected cash flows. Approximately 70% of its portfolio is concentrated in Las Vegas, the world's premier gaming destination.

Company Overview\n\nVICI Properties Inc. is the largest owner of casino and gaming real estate assets in North America, with interests in 93 experiential assets, including 54 casinos across the United States and Canada. This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is the largest owner of gaming real estate in the US, generating highly predictable cash flows from long-term triple-net leases on iconic assets like Caesars Palace Las Vegas and MGM Grand. The company was formed in 2017 as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (CEOC). The spin-off was completed on October 6, 2017, beginning with a portfolio of nineteen casinos and racetracks, all leased to Caesars at a total initial annual rent of $630 million, and four golf courses.\n\nVICI operates as a specialized real estate investment trust (REIT) concentrating on experiential assets within the gaming, hospitality, wellness, entertainment, and leisure sectors. Operating under long-term triple net lease agreements, the company secures consistent rental income and stable cash flow by owning an extensive and diversified portfolio of high-profile properties in the United States and Canada. The core of VICI's business model lies in the acquisition and ownership of experiential assets and the subsequent leasing of these properties on a triple net basis. This arrangement places the responsibility of property operating expenses on the tenants, ensuring predictability in operating costs and revenue generation.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\nVICI Properties owns 93 experiential assets across a geographically diverse portfolio consisting of 54 gaming properties and 39 other experiential properties across the United States and Canada.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Major Development Projects:\n- **Red Rock Resorts Partnership**: VICI entered into an agreement to provide up to $510.0 million in a delayed draw term loan facility for the development of a tribal casino in central California that will be developed and managed by affiliates of Red Rock Resorts.

Growth Strategy\n\nVICI Properties' goal is to create the highest quality and most productive experiential real estate portfolio through a strategy of partnering with the highest quality experiential place makers and operators. VICI's growth strategy revolves around partnering with the highest-quality experiential place makers and operators to create engaging tourism experiences.\n\nKey strategic initiatives include:\n- **Diversification Beyond Gaming**: The real opportunity lies in the deliberate shift to non-gaming experiential real estate. This strategy diversifies the income stream away from a heavy reliance on casino operators, tapping into the structural consumer trend of prioritizing experiences over physical goods.\n- **Partner Property Growth Fund Strategy**: VICI announced an agreement to provide up to $700.0 million of capital to The Venetian Resort for extensive reinvestment projects. The Venetian Capital Investment is comprised of $400.0 million that was drawn in 2024 and an incremental $300.0 million available until November 1, 2026.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Major Tenants:\n- **Caesars Entertainment**: Primary tenant from VICI's original portfolio\n- **MGM Resorts International**: Through the acquired MGM Growth Properties portfolio\n- **Apollo Global Management**: Apollo Global Management bought the operating business and leased the property from Vici for $250 million per year for The Venetian complex\n- **Penn National Gaming**: Operating multiple VICI properties\n- **Hard Rock International**: Leasing several properties including Jack Cincinnati Casino\n\n### Growing Tenant Base:\nVICI announced its 14th tenant, Clairvest, in connection with an MGM agreement, diversifying its tenant roster. VICI Properties has a growing array of real estate and financing partnerships with leading developers and operators in other experiential sectors, including Cabot, Cain, Canyon Ranch, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf Resorts, Homefield, Kalahari Resorts and Lucky Strike Entertainment.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Earnings Performance:\nThird Quarter 2025: Total revenues increased 4.4% year-over-year to $1.0 billion; Net income attributable to common stockholders increased 4.0% year-over-year to $762.0 million; AFFO attributable to common stockholders increased 7.4% year-over-year to $637.6 million.\n\nSecond Quarter 2025: Total revenues increased 4.6% year-over-year to $1.0 billion; Net income attributable to common stockholders increased 16.7% year-over-year to $865.1 million; AFFO attributable to common stockholders increased 6.4% year-over-year to $630.2 million.\n\n### 2025 Guidance:\nThe Company estimates AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2025 will be between $2,510 million and $2,520 million, or between $2.36 and $2.37 per diluted common share.\n\n### Key Financial Metrics:\n- In 2024, VICI Properties's revenue was $3.85 billion, an increase of 6.53% compared to the previous year's $3.61 billion. Earnings were $2.68 billion, an increase of 6.58%.\n- Long-Term Visibility: The weighted average lease term (WALT), which includes tenant renewal options, stands at an exceptional 40.2 years as of Q2 2025\n- The company's operational efficiency is highlighted by its exceptionally low General & Administrative (G&A) spending ratio, which was approximately 1.3% of total revenue in 2023.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Interest Rate Environment**: With the Fed already hinting at an upcoming rate cut in September 2025, we believe that the REIT may refinance more of its expensive debts at lower interest rates ahead.\n- **Las Vegas Recovery**: VICI's Las Vegas Strip portfolio remains promising as well, aided by the region's ongoing diversification from gaming to a global entertainment hub across F1 racing and Backstreet Boys residency.\n- **Gaming Industry Growth**: Gaming industry growth (3% CAGR to $206.5B by 2028) and strategic diversification into experiential assets drive long-term potential.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Tenant Concentration Risk**: The biggest risk right now is tenant concentration in large casino operators facing a soft tourism and gaming backdrop. Barclays' recent cut to its VICI price target, citing tenant concerns, feels particularly relevant because it spotlights how much the investment case hinges on Caesars, MGM and other major operators continuing to meet long term rent obligations.\n- **Regulatory Changes**: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), effective in 2026, introduces a critical tax change for gamblers: losses can now offset only 90% of winnings, up from 100%. This seemingly small adjustment could have outsized consequences.\n- **Economic Sensitivity**: Spending on video games by young Americans (ages 18-24) fell nearly 25 percent year-over-year in early 2025 due to economic pressures like student loan repayments and rising credit card debt. This suggests that lower-to-middle-income consumers are already pulling back on non-essential entertainment.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nOn the Strip, VICI will control more than 660 acres covering a dozen properties that include nearly 40,000 hotel rooms and 6 million square feet of convention and meeting space. From Venetian to Mandalay Bay, VICI will likely control most of the major assets along the Strip with the exception of a few properties. The purchase of MGM Growth Properties increased VICI's annual revenue by $1 billion, making it the largest land owner on the Las Vegas Strip, with over 660 acres.\n\nVICI has established itself as the dominant gaming real estate platform in North America, with market-leading positions in:\n- Las Vegas Strip gaming real estate (largest landowner)\n- Regional gaming properties across multiple states\n- Experiential entertainment real estate\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors:\n**Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc (GLPI)**:\n- VICI has a $30.67 billion market cap compared to Gaming and Leisure Properties' $13.2 billion market cap.\n- GLPI owns a large slate of regional casino properties, primarily leased back to Penn National Gaming and other regional operators. GLPI's strengths lie in its long-standing relationships with regional gaming operators and a track record of steady dividends. Its portfolio is more regionally diversified across the U.S. heartland and less concentrated on single mega-destination markets.\n\n**EPR Properties**: \n- EPR Properties is a Kansas City, Missouri-based REIT with ownership interests that cover the entertainment and recreation sectors, including amusement parks, theaters and ski resorts.\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\n- VICI's competitive advantages stem from its unmatched portfolio of iconic properties, strategic relationships with industry-leading operators, and significant liquidity position. This robust liquidity allows VICI to maintain its growth trajectory while many competitors may be constrained by capital limitations.\n- VICI's master leases with each operator are some of the best-worded leases for any REIT. They come with protections for VICI's revenue stream and capex clauses that force tenants to update and maintain the properties.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Strategic Partnerships:\n- **Cain International & Eldridge Industries**: VICI announced the establishment of a strategic relationship with Cain International and Eldridge Industries, launched with VICI's $300.0 million investment into a mezzanine loan related to the development of One Beverly Hills, a landmark 17.5-acre luxury mixed-use development.\n\n### Historical Major Acquisitions:\n- **MGM Growth Properties**: In April 2022, Vici acquired MGM Growth Properties for $17.2 billion (including $5.7 billion in assumed debt).\n- **Venetian Complex**: Vici purchased the real estate of the Venetian complex from Las Vegas Sands in February 2022 for $4 billion. The acquisition included the Venetian and Palazzo casino hotels and the Sands Expo convention center.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Highlights:\n- For Q3 2025, VICI grew its AFFO per share earnings by 5.3% versus Q3 2024.\n- A dividend of $0.45 per share was declared, representing a 4% increase from the previous amount and marking the eighth consecutive annual increase.\n- The Venetian reported record hotel revenues and gaming volumes this summer, indicating strong performance despite market challenges.\n\n### Upcoming Earnings:\nVICI Properties announced that it will release its fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial results on Wednesday, February 25, 2026 after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company will host a conference call and audio webcast on Thursday, February 26, 2026 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\n## 13.

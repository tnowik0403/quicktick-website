Ondas Networks' customer end markets include railroads, utilities, oil and gas, transportation, aviation (including drone operators) and government entities whose demands span a wide range of mission critical applications.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nOndas expects to receive the initial purchase order in January 2026 to launch a multi-phase program spanning the next two years. Under the tender, OAS will architect, develop, and integrate a full-scale drone-based autonomous border-protection system designed to operate across both fixed and mobile environments. The multi-phase program is expected to culminate in the deployment of thousands of autonomous drones to provide persistent ISR, swarm-based response, and automated threat mitigation across complex border terrain.\n\nThe integration of Sentrycs technology into OAS' System-of-Systems platform creates a unified CUAS architecture combining cyber takeover, autonomous interception with Iron Drone Raider, real-time sensor fusion, and AI-driven decision-making.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nManagement will review the Company's Core+ Strategic Growth Program for 2026 and beyond, detailing how Ondas is combining disciplined execution of its core businesses with targeted strategic investments, partnerships, and acquisitions to accelerate growth, expand global market reach, and enhance long-term shareholder value.\n\nOndas launched Ondas Capital, a new business unit focused on accelerating the global deployment of unmanned and autonomous systems to Allied defense and security markets. Ondas Capital will combine advisory services with direct investment to support rapid scaling of mature and combat-proven defense technologies. The unit will initially emphasize activity in Eastern Europe, with a particular focus on Ukraine, and build bridges to Allied markets in the United States and Europe.\n\nBeyond announced targets, Ondas highlighted a robust M&A pipeline with over 20 potential acquisition targets that could add more than $500 million in 2026 revenue.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nOndas secured $8.2 million order from major European security agency to protect one of Europe's largest airports with multiple Iron Drone Raider systems. Ondas recently reported record-high Q3 revenues, a significantly expanded backlog, and raised its 2025 and 2026 revenue forecasts, reflecting accelerating demand across its defense and security portfolio.\n\nSecured a $2.7 million order from a major defense customer for Iron Drone Raider for multiple units. Secured a $3.5 million order from a leading defense entity for Apeiro's rugged UGVs and modular payloads, strengthening OAS' position in the global ground robotics market.\n\nRoboteam has sold hundreds of UGVs to major military and homeland security organizations over its history and recently secured over $20 million in orders from an existing major military customer which will be fulfilled through 2026.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nOndas delivered a record quarter with $10.1 million in revenue, representing a 582% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Despite impressive top-line growth, the company posted a net loss of $7.48 million, though this marked an improvement from the $9.53 million loss in Q3 2024. The company's consolidated backlog stood at $23.3 million at quarter-end.\n\nGross Profit: $2.6 million, representing a 26% gross margin in Q3 2025. Operating Expenses: Increased to $18.1 million in Q3 2025 from $8.7 million in Q3 2024. Adjusted EBITDA Loss: $8.8 million for Q3 2025. Cash Position: $433 million as of September 30, 2025.\n\nThe Company continues to experience strong growth in 2025 and now expects to generate revenue of at least $36 million for the year, an increase from the prior target of at least $25 million. This new revenue target reflects continued strong performance of Ondas' core OAS business and the addition of newly acquired businesses since the beginning of the second quarter of 2025. This outlook is supported by results to date and the $23.3 million in consolidated backlog at the end of Q3 2025.\n\nHowever, Ondas also projected at least $110 million in 2026. The drone maker has a history of outperforming, so it's entirely possible that the company exceeds its $110 million benchmark.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nAeroVironment is gaining market share thanks to an acquisition, but Ondas looks like the better drone stock for long-term investors. This context is important, and it explains why Ondas (ONDS +5.50%) is the better drone stock.\n\nOndas is an emerging player, while AeroVironment is a long-established leader with deep ties to the U.S. military and allied governments. Skydio is widely regarded as the leading U.S. autonomous-drone maker and a strategic domestic alternative to Chinese vendors like DJI, particularly for public-safety, utilities, and defense customers.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. AeroVironment (AVAV)\nAeroVironment is one of the key pure-play beneficiaries of rising global demand for military drones and its biggest competitive moat is the strategic ties with the U.S. and allied governments. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the total ceiling value of contract awards reached $3.5 billion, driving bookings to $1.4 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, it expects revenues between $1.95 billion and $2 billion. Nonetheless, AVAV's extensive exposure to the government vertical makes it prone to customer concentration risk.\n\n### Market Position\nOndas (NASDAQ:ONDS) is the backbone of autonomous drone communication, providing high-speed wireless networks for industrial and defense drones. Its IronDrone platform enables secure, real-time drone operations, making it indispensable for logistics, surveying, and military applications. Trading at $12.84 with a $4.8 billion market cap, ONDS is poised to \"explode higher,\" per analysts, with a moderate buy consensus and targets up to $13.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions (2025)\n1. **Sentrycs** - Completed acquisition of Sentry CS Ltd. (Sentrycs), an Israel-based global leader in Cyber-over-RF (CoRF) and Protocol-Manipulation counter-UAS technology.\n\n2. **Roboteam** - Completed acquisition of Roboteam Ltd., a global developer of rugged tactical unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Ondas expects the addition of Roboteam will add $3 - 4 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 and at least $30 million in revenue for 2026.\n\n3. **Apeiro Motion** - Acquired Apeiro Motion (Apeiro), an Israeli robotics innovator developing advanced unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), quadrupedal robots, and fiber-optic communication spools for radio-independent UAV and UGV operations expanding OAS' multi-domain autonomy portfolio.\n\n4. **4M Defense** - Acquired a controlling interest in 4M Defense, a specialized land intelligence and demining company focused on autonomous robotics and AI-driven subsurface mapping for landmine, IED, and UXO detection and clearance. The acquisition extends OAS' Continuum of Autonomy into subsurface operations, adding humanitarian and defense-grade demining capabilities.\n\n### Strategic Investments\nOndas announced its intent to invest up to $11 million in Drone Fight Group (DFG), a Ukrainian developer of advanced unmanned aerial systems. This investment-to be executed through the Company's strategic advisory and investment platform, Ondas Capital-represents Ondas' first planned capital deployment in support of battle-tested Ukrainian defense technologies.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Capital Raising\nA recent SEC filing detailed a $1 billion stock-and-warrant sale expected to close near Jan. 12. A filing signed the same day revealed the company anticipates net proceeds near $959.2 million from a $1 billion stock-and-warrant offering. Ondas announced it priced 19 million shares and, instead of stock, pre-funded warrants allowing purchase of up to 41.79 million shares, plus common warrants for as many as 121.58 million shares.\n\n### Analyst Upgrades\nOppenheimer upgraded Ondas to Outperform from Perform with a US$12 price target after Q3 revenue of US$10.1m and a 26% gross margin, pointing to what it sees as strong demand in Ondas Autonomous Systems, supported by an all time high US$22.2m backlog. Oppenheimer highlights the company's reported pro forma cash of US$840m and describes Ondas as having an open platform with a broad set of technologies, partners, and programs.\n\nThe company is scheduled to hold an investor event next Friday, January 16, which Stifel anticipates will include \"at least a few new positive updates.\"\n\n### Corporate Rebranding\nThe company also revealed plans to rebrand as Ondas Inc. and relocate its headquarters to West Palm Beach, Florida, a move that aligns with its transformation into a global defense and security technology platform. The rebranding is expected to take effect in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n## 12.

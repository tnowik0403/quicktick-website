(formerly TimkenSteel Corporation) is a leading North American producer of special bar quality (SBQ) steel, carbon, and alloy steel products designed for high-stress applications. Headquartered in Canton, Ohio, the company operates a fully integrated steel mill with electric arc furnace melting, continuous casting, rolling, and precision finishing capabilities, producing approximately 800,000-900,000 tons annually. Metallus focuses on customized, high-performance steels used in automotive components (e.g., crankshafts, gears, axles—~60% of sales), energy markets (e.g., oil & gas drilling tools, wind energy—~20%), and industrial/distribution (~20%). The company serves major OEMs and tier-1 suppliers with products emphasizing superior cleanliness, machinability, and fatigue resistance. Rebranded to Metallus in May 2024 following its 2024 spinoff from The Timken Company, it emphasizes operational excellence, supply chain resilience, and innovation in sustainable steelmaking. Metallus holds a competitive edge in North America through its melt-to-metal model, enabling rapid customization amid reshoring trends. However, it faces cyclical steel pricing pressures and automotive demand volatility.

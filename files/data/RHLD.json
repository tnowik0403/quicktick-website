In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

RHLD is listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE ticker: RHLD). Data is sparse in English-language sources; most info is in Hebrew from TASE. No recent earnings reports (<6 months), announcements, or transcripts found. No active discussions on major forums. No verified quantitative financials (revenues, earnings, margins) from reports <6 months old. Stock not listed on major US exchanges (NASDAQ/NYSE); OTC data unavailable.\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nResilience Holdings Ltd (RHLD) is an Israel-based holding company listed on the TASE since 2007. It primarily operates in the insurance brokerage sector through subsidiaries like Resilience Insurance Brokers Ltd. The company offers a range of commercial, industrial, property, liability, and employee benefits insurance products to businesses and individuals in Israel. Resilience focuses on tailored brokerage services, risk management consulting, and claims handling, serving SMEs and larger corporates. It emphasizes cyber insurance and resilience-focused policies amid rising cyber threats in Israel. With a small market presence, RHLD generates revenue via commissions from insurers (e.g., partnerships with Clal Insurance, Harel Group). The firm has ~20 employees and operates mainly in central Israel. Historical challenges include low growth and market consolidation pressures. As a micro-cap, it trades illiquidly with limited institutional ownership. No major pivots to tech/insurtech noted; remains traditional brokerage amid digital shift in sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- No announcements, earnings calls, or press releases in last 6 months (last TASE filing: Q2 2024 summary in Hebrew, no English transcript).\n- No M&A, partnerships, or client wins reported since 2023.\n- Stock suspended from trading intermittently (last active trade date per TASE: September 26, 2024; low volume ~100 shares/day).\n- No coverage in articles (e.g., Calcalist, Globes - Israeli financial media) or online discussions (0 mentions on StockTwits/Reddit past month).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Limited disclosure: Focus on organic expansion in cyber/property insurance amid Israel-Gaza conflict boosting demand for risk coverage.\n- No explicit 2024-2025 strategy outlined; historical emphasis on client retention (80%+ renewal rates per old reports) and niche cyber products.\n- No capex plans or R&D for new tech platforms mentioned.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Niche cyber insurance demand post-Oct 7, 2023 events; stable brokerage model. | Illiquid stock; micro-cap status limits funding; no dividends; management opacity. |\n| **Sector (Insurance Brokerage in Israel)** | Rising premiums (+15% YoY sector-wide per 2024 Bank of Israel data); cyber threats (Israel #1 global cyber target). | Intense competition from giants (Harel, Clal, Phoenix); regulatory hikes (capital requirements up 10% in 2024); economic slowdown (Israel GDP growth ~1.5% forecast 2024). Inflation (3-4%) erodes margins. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- Commercial insurance (property, liability, D&O).\n- Personal lines (home, auto, health).\n- Employee benefits and pension brokerage.\n- Risk consulting and claims advocacy.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- None announced or in development pipeline per TASE filings.\n- Potential cyber resilience add-ons hinted in 2023 reports, but no updates.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- Israeli insurance brokerage market ~ILS 5B premiums brokered annually (2023 est. from Israel Insurance Association).\n- RHLD share: <0.5% (micro player; top 5 brokers hold 60%+ e.g., Mihal ~15%, Gross-Klinov ~12%).\n\n## Forecast of Growth/Decline in Market Share\n- No analyst forecasts (0 sell-side coverage).\n- Likely flat/decline: Sector consolidation favors larger peers; RHLD revenue historically stagnant (~ILS 10-15M pre-2023). Growth upside limited without M&A.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric | RHLD | Mihal Insurance (top peer) | Harel Brokerage (integrated) |\n|--------|------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Market Position** | Micro-cap broker | Leading independent broker | Arm of top insurer |\n| **Est. Revenue (latest old data)** | N/A recent | ~ILS 500M (2023) | ~ILS 2B (brokerage seg.) |\n| **Strengths vs RHLD** | - | Scale, national footprint | Product integration, capital |\n| **RHLD Edge** | Niche cyber focus | None | None |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Current/Potential Major Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Commissions from major underwriters (Clal, Harel, Menora - no exclusives).\n- **M&A**: None recent; 2021 subsidiary acquisition (small agency, undisclosed).\n- **Clients**: SMEs in manufacturing/tech; no named majors. Potential: Israeli tech firms (e.g., Check Point ecosystem) for cyber policies.\n- No new deals.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Eliyahu Resilience (family-controlled); stable but unproven growth track record.\n- **ESG**: No ratings; cyber focus aligns with resilience theme.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Israel conflict), illiquidity (avg vol <500 sh/day), currency (ILS/USD volatility).\n- **Sentiment**: Neutral-low; no hype on forums; TASE small-cap index underperformer.\n\n## Current Fundamentals and Stock Data (Verified as of Oct 4, 2024)\n- **Stock Price**: 17.10 ILS (last close Sep 26, 2024 per TASE/Investing.com; suspended since - check TASE for resumption. ~USD 4.70 at 3.64 ILS/USD).\n- **Market Cap**: ~17.4M ILS (~USD 4.8M).\n- **Financials**: No verified Q2 2024 or later (Q1 2024: no English details; historical gross margins ~25-30% pre-2023).\n- **P/E, EV/EBITDA**: N/A (no earnings).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **2/10 (Strong Sell)**  \n  Rationale: Extreme illiquidity, no growth catalysts, geopolitical risks, zero analyst coverage, stagnant micro-cap in consolidating sector. No upside for growth-oriented portfolio; high risk of delisting/suspension. Prefer larger Israeli insurers (e.g., Harel - ticker HARL.TA).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: 12.00 ILS (~USD 3.30)  \n  Based on 0.8x book value (historical avg; no DCF possible sans data). Implies -30% downside from last price. Hold only for locals; avoid for US/international portfolios.",

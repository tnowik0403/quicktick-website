Founded in 1986 and headquartered in San Jose, CA, Synaptics pioneered capacitive touch technology, powering touchpads in over 90% of premium Windows laptops historically. Today, it has evolved into a diversified platform provider with its Astra™ edge AI architecture (e.g., SLAB1000/1100 processors), VideoSmart™ video processing for conferencing, AudioSmart™ voice/audio DSPs, and display drivers for OLED/LCD.\n\nThe company's revenue mix has shifted: FY2024 saw ~42% from Mobile/Edge IoT, 36% Computing, 22% Automotive/Industrial (per Q4 FY2024 earnings). Synaptics serves Tier-1 OEMs with customizable, low-power SoCs, emphasizing AI inference at the edge for privacy and efficiency. With 1,400+ employees, R&D spend at 20-25% of revenue, and a patent portfolio exceeding 2,000, Synaptics targets secular growth in AI PCs, automotive cockpits, and smart home/edge devices amid PC refresh cycles and EV adoption. Challenges include cyclical PC markets and China-centric supply chains, but tailwinds from Microsoft Copilot+ PCs and generative AI position it for rebound.

(NASDAQ: OSPN) is a global cybersecurity leader specializing in identity assurance and fraud prevention solutions for the financial services sector. Founded in 1991 (formerly VASCO Data Security), the company provides software platforms that enable secure digital customer experiences, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), transaction signing, anti-fraud AI-driven detection, and e-signatures/digital agreements. Its core offerings protect against phishing, malware, and account takeover in banking apps, online payments, and mobile transactions. OneSpan serves over 10,000 financial institutions worldwide, with a focus on mid-tier banks, credit unions, and fintechs in North America (45% revenue), EMEA (40%), and APAC/LATAM (15%). The company's shift to a subscription-based SaaS model has driven recurring revenue growth, with Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) reaching $119.3 million as of Q2 2024 (up 10% YoY). Amid rising cyber threats (e.g., 300% surge in financial fraud per FBI 2024 IC3 report), OneSpan emphasizes AI-powered behavioral biometrics and risk-based authentication. However, it faces competition in a fragmented $10B+ IAM market, with challenges from macroeconomic pressures on IT budgets. Strategic pivots include product consolidation under the OneSpan Platform and expansion into e-signatures via the 2023 Digidentity acquisition.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 1, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Total ARR $119.3M (+10% YoY organic); SaaS ARR $94.8M (+15% YoY); Revenue $50.9M (+8% YoY); GAAP net loss $1.1M (improved from $4.2M YoY); Non-GAAP EPS $0.26 (beat estimates).

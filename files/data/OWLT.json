(NYSE: OWLT) is a digital parenting platform pioneering data-driven baby monitoring solutions to enhance parental confidence and child safety. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Lehi, Utah, the company specializes in wearable and camera-based devices that track vital signs like heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), sleep patterns, and movement. Its flagship FDA-cleared Class II medical device, the Dream Sock, uses pulse oximetry to alert parents to potential health issues, positioning Owlet at the intersection of consumer tech and pediatric healthcare. Revenue is primarily direct-to-consumer (DTC) via owletcare.com, Amazon, and retail partners like Target and BuyBuy Baby, with growing B2B healthcare adoption. Owlet went public via SPAC merger in July 2021 (Sandbridge Acquisition Corp.). As of Q2 2024, it reported direct sales of $13.1 million (93% of total revenue), international revenue at 14% of total, and a subscriber base of 148,000 Dream Sock+ users.

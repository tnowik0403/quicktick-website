Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nHealth Benefits segment operating revenue was $42.2 billion in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $4.0 billion, or 10 percent compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, recently closed acquisitions, and growth in our Medicare Advantage membership.\n\nMedical membership totaled approximately 45.4 million as of September 30, 2025, driven by lower year over year BlueCard® and Medicaid membership.\n\nThe company had roughly 8.6 million Medicaid members and 2.2 million Medicare Advantage members.\n\nTargeted growth in Medicare Advantage membership, aiming for 2.2 million to 2.25 million members by year-end 2025.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nOperating revenue was $50.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $5.4 billion, or 12 percent compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nElevance raked in net income of $1.2 billion on revenue of $50.1 billion in the quarter, up 17% and 12% year over year, respectively.\n\nThe company posted an adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.30, exceeding the forecasted $4.95, marking a 21.82% surprise.\n\nThrough the first nine months of the year, Elevance Health has brought in $5.1 billion in profit, down 8% compared to the $5.7 billion in earnings reported through the first three quarters of 2024. Revenues across the first three quarters of 2025 were $149.4 billion, according to the earnings report, an increase of 13.5% year over year.\n\nElevance's benefit expense ratio was 91.3%, a 180-basis-point increase year over year. An anticipated cost trend, especially in Medicare, drove this steeper ratio.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- Elevance said it has reduced denials stemming from a lack of information by 68% through its AI-powered HealthOS platform\n- Recent examples include CareBridge, a home-based care company acquired in late 2024, and Paragon Healthcare, an infusion services company, in January 2024. These are projected to contribute $1.2 billion in annual revenue by 2026.\n- Carelon, Elevance's health care services arm, saw its Q3 operating revenue increase by $4.5 billion year-over-year, according to the company's third quarter results. One driver of this growth is its acquisitions in home health services, as well as pharmacy services acquisitions, CarelonRx growth and the scaling of Carelon Services' risk-based solutions.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- The company is bracing for a decline of 125 basis points year over year in its Medicaid margins for 2026 amid this acuity trend as well as ongoing elevated utilization.\n- The company's guidance is clear and cautious: its Medicaid business is expected to reach a low point, with operating margins declining to -1.75% in 2026, down from -0.5% in 2025. This pressure stems from a persistent \"timing mismatch\" where state payment rates, often based on outdated data, fail to cover the rising cost of care for a Medicaid population with higher acuity.\n- Elevance also plans to invest \"several\" hundred million dollars in its health services division Carelon, artificial intelligence capabilities and Medicare Advantage star ratings, which could stifle earnings growth next year.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nElevance Health (5%) held the fifth largest market share nationally in Medicare Advantage among the top 10 insurers in 2024, according to the American Medical Association report.\n\nUnitedHealth Group held the largest individual share of the commercial market in 2024 at 16%, followed by Elevance and Aetna, which both controlled about 12% of the market.\n\nAmong individual insurers, Elevance Health had the largest footprint as the largest insurer in 21% (82) of metro areas.\n\nSpecifically, Elevance's market share dives deep in licensed states where it insures about one out of every 3 people.\n\nElevance differs from its peers in its unique position as the largest single provider of Blue Cross Blue Shield branded coverage, operating as the licensee for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 14 states.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nNationally, the 10 largest health insurers by market share were: 1. UnitedHealth Group (16%), 2. Elevance Health (12%), 3. CVS (Aetna) (12%), 4. Cigna (9%), 5. Health Care Service Corp. (8%) in commercial markets.\n\nUnitedHealth also topped the list in Medicare Advantage (MA), with a 30% market share. The remaining top five insurers in that space were Humana (19%), Aetna (12%), Kaiser Permanente (6%) and Elevance Health (5%).\n\nHumana, The Cigna Group, Molina Healthcare, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, and Health Care Service are some of the 9 competitors of Elevance Health.\n\nAs the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield operator, Elevance only lags UnitedHealth in US medical membership, which is particularly impressive given Elevance's limited geographic reach compared with UnitedHealth's national network.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nRecent acquisitions and partnerships include:\n\n- Elevance Health's most recent acquisition is Granular Insurance, a Risk management solution for self-funded insurers, acquired in February 2025.\n- Elevance's previous home-based care acquisitions include its 2024 acquisition of CareBridge, a home-based care provider, and its 2024 acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, an infusion services company.\n- In 2024, Elevance Health launched Mosaic Health, a joint venture with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, to establish a national primary care delivery platform. This initiative has already served nearly 1 million consumers, showcasing its commitment to innovative care models.\n- In an effort to address the issues listed above, Elevance partnered with Epic to leverage Health OS in combination with artificial intelligence to help providers further close gaps in care and reduce burdensome paperwork.\n- Elevance has also partnered with OpenAI to offer employees an enterprise version of ChatGPT, along with offering AI certifications that include training in areas such as prompt engineering and advanced AI applications.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Technology Initiatives:\n- Elevance Health this month rolled out an updated version of its Virtual Assistant tool, which allows users to ask questions about their benefits and get near-instant results.\n- By the end of 2025, more than 10 million members will have access to the virtual assistant. Mr. Lavu said Elevance plans to expand the feature to its full membership of more than 45 million people in 2026.\n- More than 38,000 employees have already completed 66,000 courses through the company's learning programs in AI training.\n\n### Corporate Governance:\n- Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) appointed Amy Schulman as an independent director, effective January 12, 2026, to enhance expertise in healthcare innovation and regulatory strategy.\n\n### Strategic Exits:\n- In a clear signal of its focus on margin, Elevance plans to exit Medicare's prescription drug plan market entirely for 2026. This move is a tactical retreat from a lower-margin segment, allowing the company to concentrate its resources on higher-margin products like Medicare Advantage HMO and dual-eligible plans.\n\n## 13.

The company's long-term growth prospects in AI-enabled healthcare services and value-based care partnerships support a moderate buy rating for investors with moderate risk appetite seeking growth upside.",

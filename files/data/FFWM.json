Moderate growth from deposits/wealth (projected 8-10% EPS CAGR 2025-2026), but CRE headwinds cap near-term upside amid sector volatility. Suitable for moderate risk portfolios seeking regional bank recovery.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $9.50 (53% upside from $6.22). Based on 1.0x TBV ($9.20 book value/share Q3), 10x 2025E EPS ($0.95), peer avg multiples, and 20% deposit growth assumption. Risks: Further Fed cuts eroding NIM; CRE defaults >1%.",

Founded in 1905 and headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Nucor produces a wide range of steel products including hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel; structural steel beams and pilings; bar steel; and plate steel. It operates three main segments: Steel Mills (core production), Steel Products (downstream fabrication like joists and decking), and Raw Materials (direct reduced iron or DRI facilities and scrap processing). With ~32,000 employees across 25+ states, Nucor emphasizes low-cost production, vertical integration, and technological innovation to maintain a competitive edge in a cyclical industry. The company avoids blast furnaces, relying on EAFs which reduce emissions by up to 75% vs. traditional methods. In 2023, it shipped ~25 million tons of steel, recycling ~20 million tons of scrap annually. Nucor has paid dividends for 51+ years and repurchased $1.5B+ in shares in 2023. Recent focus includes expanding DRI capacity for hydrogen-ready green steel amid decarbonization pressures.

Steel shipments 6M tons.\n- **March 2024**: U.S. ITC imposed anti-dumping duties (up to 88%) on Chinese steel imports, benefiting domestic producers like Nucor (formalized June 2024).\n- **Seeking Alpha/Reddit discussions (Oct 2024)**: Bullish on tariff protections; concerns over steel price weakness (~$600/ton HRC as of Oct 21).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Expand DRI capacity to 6M tons/year by 2026 (e.g., $1.7B West Virginia DRI plant Phase 2 online H1 2025; Texas expansion).\n- Invest in green steel: $2.7B+ capex planned 2024-2025 for low-emission projects, including hydrogen blending pilots.\n- Vertical integration: Grow downstream products (e.g., 25% of revenues from Steel Products segment).\n- Cost discipline: Target 10-15% EBITDA margins via EAF efficiency; $4B+ capex 2023-2025 for capacity growth to 33M tons shipments.\n- Market share gains via reshoring and infrastructure (IIJA funding).\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Cyclical steel prices (HRC down 20% YTD to ~$600/ton); CEO transition risks; high capex ($2.0B in 2024) strains FCF amid weak demand. | Low-cost leader (EBITDA/ton ~$170 in Q2); strong balance sheet (net cash $4.5B); dividend aristocrat status. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Chinese oversupply/dumping (despite 25% Trump-era tariffs); slowing auto/construction (~40% of demand); energy costs up 10%. | U.S. tariffs (Section 232 + new AD/CVD); IIJA/IRA ($1T+ infra/green spend); reshoring (auto OEMs adding 2M tons demand). Steel demand forecast +1-2% in 2025 (World Steel Assoc.). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Steel Mills (74% revenue)**: Hot-rolled sheet/coil, cold-rolled, galvanized, plate steel, wide-flange beams, bar steel.\n- **Steel Products (16%)**: Structural steel joists, decking, tubing, electrical conduit, piling.\n- **Raw Materials (10%)**: DRI pellets (3.5M tons capacity), scrap brokerage, ferrous metals trading.\n- Key facilities: 25 mills (e.g., Ghent, KY sheet mill; Gallatin, KY).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **AHSS/Gen 3 steels**: Upgrades at WV mini-mill (May 2024, $60M) for EV/auto applications.\n- **DRI Expansions**: WV Phase 2 (1.5M tons, H1 2025, $1.7B); Trinidad re-start (500k tons, 2025).\n- **Green Steel Pilots**: Hydrogen-DRI testing at Trinidad (2025); carbon capture feasibility.\n- **Trinity Plate Mill**: Texas acquisition (2023, $750M) ramping to 900k tons AHSS plate.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current U.S. Carbon Steel Market Share**: ~27% (steel mills shipments ~20M tons of ~75M total U.S. market; verified via company 10-K and USGS data 2023).\n- **Global**: <2% (focus domestic).\n- **Forecast**: +1-2% gain to 28-29% by 2026 (per mgmt. calls; infra/tariffs offset imports at 20% share). Decline risk if prices crash further (-1% if auto slows).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (Q2 2024 unless noted) | Nucor (NUE) | Steel Dynamics (STLD) | U.S. Steel (X) | Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| **Rev ($B)** | 8.08 | 4.52 | 4.42 | 5.40 |\n| **EPS** | $2.68 | $3.25 | $0.34 | $0.54 |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 14.2% | 19% | 11% | 9% |\n| **Shipments (M tons)** | 4.23 | 3.2 | 2.4 | 4.2 |\n| **Market Cap ($B, Oct 21)** | 34.7 | 19.8 | 10.2 | 6.5 |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 6.2x | 7.5x | 8.1x | 5.9x |\n| **Edge** | Cost leader, DRI | Newer mills | Legacy BF exposure | Integrated auto |\n\n*Nucor leads on efficiency/shareholder returns; STLD closest peer.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Toyota (long-term AHSS supply); Air Products (hydrogen for DRI, 2024 MoU).\n- **Recent M&A**: Acquired Harriman, TN bar mill (Nov 2023, $340M); Trinity Plate Mill (Nov 2023, $750M); RBS Next Gen (2023).\n- **Current Major Clients**: ~70% spot sales; key: GM, Ford, Toyota (auto ~25%); Nucor Building Systems; infrastructure contractors (e.g., IIJA projects).\n- **Potential Clients**: EV makers (Tesla, Rivian via AHSS); data center steel (rising demand).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG Leadership**: #1 Newsweek Green Steel (2024); 90%+ recycled content.\n- **Moat**: Scrap sourcing network; tech (AI optimization in mills).\n- **Risks**: 60% pricing exposure; union-free model aids flexibility.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 15 Buy/8 Hold/1 Sell (Yahoo, Oct 2024 avg PT $173).\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Q2 2024 Earnings, July 22, 2024 – <6 months)\n| Metric | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n|--------|---------|---------|------------|\n| **Revenue** | $8.08B | $9.52B | -15% |\n| **Net Earnings** | $645M | $1.58B | -59% |\n| **Gross Margin** | 9.1% | 15.6% | -640bps |\n| **EBITDA** | $1.15B | $2.0B | -42% |\n| **FCF** | $845M | $1.9B | -55% |\n\n**Q3 2024 Guidance (July 22)**: Steel mill EBITDA $845M (up QoQ).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy – Hold for now, Buy on dips). Cyclical tailwinds from tariffs/infra outweigh near-term price weakness; undervalued vs. peers/historical multiples (fwd P/E 9x vs. 12x avg). Growth upside from DRI/green steel in EV/infra boom.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $175/share (30% upside; DCF-based at 10% WACC, 5% growth terminal; aligns with avg analyst PT $173). Moderate risk: Volatility from steel cycles balanced by fortress BS. Target for growth portfolios.",

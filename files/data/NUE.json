Company Overview\n\nNucor Corporation is an American company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, that engages in the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products. The company is the largest steel producer in the United States and the largest recycler of scrap in North America, while also ranking as the 16th-largest steel producer in the world. \n\nThe company operates through three primary segments: Steel Mills, Steel Products, and Raw Materials. The Steel Mills segment produces a comprehensive range of steel products including hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized sheet steel products; plate steel products; wide-flange beams, beam blanks, and H-piling and sheet piling structural steel products; and bar steel products, such as blooms, billets, concrete reinforcing and merchant bars, and engineered special bar quality products. The Steel Products segment offers steel joists and joist girders, steel decks, and galvanized torque tubes for use in solar arrays, hollow structural section steel tubing, electrical conduit, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, steel grating and expanded metal, wire and wire mesh, metal building systems, insulated metal panels, steel racking, overhead doors, and utility towers and structures for communications and energy transmission. The Raw Materials segment produces direct reduced iron (DRI); brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron, and DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal; and engages in the natural gas production and industrial gas business.\n\nThe company uses electric arc furnaces and continuous casting to melt scrap steel as opposed to blast furnaces to melt iron, with its circular production process using an average of nearly 80 percent recycled scrap and having one-third the greenhouse gas emissions intensity compared to the average traditional extractive steelmaking process. In 2024, the company produced and sold approximately 18.5 million tons of steel and recycled 18 million tons of scrap.\n\n## 2.

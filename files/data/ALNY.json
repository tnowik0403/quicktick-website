Daily Volume**: 1.15 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $29.5 billion\n\n## Company Overview (192 words)\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) is a biopharmaceutical leader in RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of small interfering RNA (siRNA) medicines targeting genetically defined diseases. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Cambridge, MA, the company leverages its proprietary GalNAc conjugate platform for subcutaneous delivery, enabling liver-targeted therapies with durable effects. Alnylam has four approved products: ONPATTRO® (patisiran, 2018) and AMVUTTRA® (vutrisiran, 2022) for polyneuropathy in hereditary transthyretin-mediated (ATTR) amyloidosis; GIVLAARI® (givosiran, 2019) for acute hepatic porphyria (AHP); and OXLUMO® (lumasiran, 2020) for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). Its TTR franchise (ONPATTRO/AMVUTTRA) drives ~70% of revenues. Alnylam reports ~$1.47B in trailing-12-month revenues, with a robust pipeline of >20 programs across ATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), porphyrias, metabolic diseases, and neurodegeneration. The company shifted from R&D focus to profitability, guiding toward breakeven by 2026. Partnerships with Regeneron, Novartis (royalties from Leqvio®/inclisiran), and others provide milestone/royalty streams. With ~2,100 employees, Alnylam holds a first-mover advantage in RNAi, capturing rare disease markets amid growing siRNA adoption.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 3, 2024**: Announced positive topline Phase 3 HELIOS-B results for subcutaneous vutrisiran (AMVUTTRA) in ATTR-CM; met primary endpoint of 30% risk reduction in all-cause mortality/cardiovascular events vs. external control (p<0.0001). Supports sNDA filing H1 2025.\n- **September 27, 2024**: Presented new AMVUTTRA data at Heart Failure Society Annual Meeting, showing sustained benefits in ATTR polyneuropathy.\n- **July 31, 2024 (Q2 Earnings)**: Total revenues $392.4M (+33% YoY); net product revenues $313.8M (+42% YoY, driven by AMVUTTRA $221M). Net loss $127.8M. Raised FY2024 guidance to $1.65-1.75B total revenues.\n- **June 2024**: European Commission approved AMVUTTRA label expansion for early-stage ATTR polyneuropathy.\n- **April 29, 2024 (Q1 Earnings)**: Revenues $359.2M (+53% YoY); AMVUTTRA $176M.\n- **Pipeline Updates**: ALN-APP (Alzheimer's) Phase 1 data expected YE2024; fitusiran (Hemophilia A/B with Regeneron) faces FDA CRL (June 2024) due to trial halt—resubmission planned H1 2025.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Commercial Expansion**: Prioritize TTR franchise growth (AMVUTTRA surpassing ONPATTRO; goal: $2B+ peak sales by 2030). Launch in ATTR-CM pending approvals.\n- **Pipeline Acceleration**: Advance 5 late-stage programs (e.g., cemdisiran for complement-mediated diseases, ALN-KHK for CSG); target 10+ approvals by 2030 via GalNAc/ESC+ platforms.\n- **Profitability Path**: Cost discipline to achieve adjusted net income positivity in 2026; R&D spend ~$1.1-1.2B in 2024.\n- **Geographic Reach**: U.S./EU dominance; ex-U.S. growth via partners (e.g., Genzyme for ONPATTRO).\n- **Diversification**: Extra-hepatic RNAi (inhaled/central nervous system delivery).\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | - AMVUTTRA ramp-up (Q2 demand +60% YoY); HELIOS-B success de-risks ATTR-CM (~500K global patients).<br>- Strong cash ($2.5B as of Q2); no debt dilution imminent. | - Ongoing losses (Q2 EPS -$2.53); high R&D burn.<br>- Fitusiran delay risks milestones (~$200M potential).<br>- Manufacturing scale-up for SC vutrisiran. |\n| **Sector (RNAi/Biotech)** | - RNAi market to $15B+ by 2030 (Grand View Research); siRNA adoption rising.<br>- Rare disease pricing power (AMVUTTRA ~$465K/pt/year). | - Competition in ATTR/TTR (e.g., NTLA-2001 gene editing).<br>- Regulatory scrutiny (fitusiran CRL); biotech funding crunch (XBI -10% YTD). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Product      | Indication                  | Approval Date | Q2 2024 Global Net Sales | Key Notes |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|\n| AMVUTTRA    | ATTR amyloidosis w/ polyneuropathy | 2022 (US)/2021 (EU) | $221M (+101% YoY) | SC Q3 dosing; 90% of TTR pts switching from ONPATTRO. |\n| ONPATTRO    | ATTR amyloidosis w/ polyneuropathy | 2018 (US)/2019 (EU) | $65M (-36% YoY) | IV; lifecycle mgmt via fixed-dose. |\n| GIVLAARI    | AHP                        | 2019         | $15M (stable)            | Quarterly SC; market saturation. |\n| OXLUMO      | PH1                        | 2020         | $13M (+17% YoY)          | Pediatric expansion. |\n\n- **Total Product Revenues (Q2 2024)**: $313.8M (+42% YoY).\n- **Collaborations/Royalties**: $78.6M in Q2 (e.g., Novartis Leqvio royalties up 70%).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Vutrisiran in ATTR-CM**: sNDA filing H1 2025 (US); MAA H2 2025 (EU).

Revenue CAGR 25-30% through 2028 (per consensus), driven by label expansions. Potential decline risk if gene therapies (NTLA) penetrate.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric                  | ALNY              | Ionis (IONS)     | Arrowhead (ARWR) | Novo Nordisk/Dicerna |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Market Cap**         | $30.8B           | $6.5B           | $3.2B           | N/A (acquired)      |\n| **Approved RNAi Prods**| 4                | 2 (Spinraza core)| 0               | 1 (preclinical)     |\n| **2024 Rev Guidance**  | $1.65-1.75B      | ~$2.3B (total)  | <$50M           | N/A                 |\n| **Pipeline Stage**     | 5 Phase 3        | 4 Phase 3       | 4 Phase 3       | Early               |\n| **Strengths**          | Commercial leader, TTR dominance | ASO breadth    | siRNA potency   | GalNAc IP           |\n| **Weaknesses**         | Losses, liver focus | Liver tox     | No approvals    | Integrated          |\n\n- ALNY leads in commercial RNAi; trades at premium EV/Sales ~17x 2025E (vs. peers 10-15x).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships**:\n  - Regeneron: Fitusiran, cemdisiran (up to $3B milestones).\n  - Novartis: Inclisiran royalties ($150M+ cumulative).\n  - Roche: Zilebesiran (upfront $10M; $1.85B milestones).\n  - Historical: Sanofi/Genzyme (ONPATTRO royalties).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Dicerna (2021, $3.2B) for GalNAc tech; no major deals since.\n- **Major Clients**: Direct sales to ~1,000 ATTR/AHP/PH1 patients globally; partners handle ex-US. Potential: ATTR-CM (100K+ US patients), Hemophilia (400K global).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Yvonne Greenstreet (since 2016); track record of 4 approvals.\n- **ESG**: Strong IP (300+ patents); diversity initiatives; sustainability in manufacturing.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish post-HELIOS-B (analyst upgrades, e.g., BofA to Buy Oct 2024). Online buzz (StockTwits/Reddit): Positive on pipeline, concerns on valuation.\n- **Risks**: Binary trial outcomes, competition from gene editing (Intellia, Beam).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – High growth potential from ATTR-CM launch and pipeline catalysts outweigh near-term losses. TTR franchise inflection + profitability path support 25%+ upside for growth-oriented portfolios (moderate risk via cash buffer).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $285 (18% upside from $242). Based on 8x 2026E sales ($2.9B consensus) + 50% pipeline premium; aligns with top analyst targets (avg. $255, high $300 per Yahoo/Consensus as of Oct 14, 2024). Hold if risk-averse; monitor Q3 earnings (Nov 4, 2024).",

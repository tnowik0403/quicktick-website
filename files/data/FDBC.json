Potential: PA state contractors via Harrisburg LPO; renewables firms post-ESG launch.\n- **Other Qualitative**: High customer satisfaction (90% NPS score, 2024 survey); community involvement (e.g., $1M+ donations 2023); conservative underwriting (avg. loan-to-value 65%).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy for growth upside). Rationale: Resilient NIM trajectory, deposit strength, and PA expansion offset sector headwinds. 20-25% upside potential amid rate cuts; moderate risk via low CRE exposure and capital buffer. YTD outperformance and undervaluation (P/TB 1.4x vs. peers 1.6x) support accumulation.\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: $65.00 (12-month; +21% from $53.62). Based on 13x 2025E EPS $5.10 (consensus Zacks/TipRanks), peer multiples, and 5% deposit/3% loan CAGR. Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk (beta 0.85). Hold if risk aversion rises on CRE news.",

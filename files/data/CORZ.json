(NASDAQ: CORZ) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 15, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Closing Price**: $11.34\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.52 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $2.61 - $18.63\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 22.5 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nCore Scientific, Inc. (CORZ) is a leading U.S.-based provider of digital infrastructure, primarily operating large-scale data centers optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) and Bitcoin mining. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company owns and operates 12 data centers across Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Texas, with a total energized power capacity exceeding 700 MW as of Q2 2024. Historically focused on Bitcoin mining, Core Scientific has pivoted aggressively toward AI and HPC hosting amid the post-bankruptcy restructuring completed on January 31, 2024. This shift leverages its low-cost, scalable infrastructure—powered by over 80% zero-carbon energy sources—to meet surging demand for GPU-intensive workloads from AI hyperscalers.\n\nEmerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2024 with a deleveraged balance sheet (reduced debt from $4.5B to ~$60M), CORZ reported Q2 2024 revenue of $149.4 million (up 30% YoY) and adjusted EBITDA of $36.0 million. The company mined 2,420 Bitcoin in Q2 and hosts ~25,000 GPUs under multi-year contracts. With Bitcoin halving in April 2024 pressuring miners, CORZ's HPC pivot positions it as a \"picks and shovels\" play in the AI boom, targeting $1B+ annualized HPC revenue run-rate by 2025.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $149.4M (+30% YoY), net loss $32.2M (improved from $190.3M loss YoY), Hosted Revenue $67.3M (+92% YoY), self-mining revenue $77.4M (-5% YoY post-halving).\n- **September 18, 2024**: Announced expansion of HPC hosting at Denton, TX facility to 150MW by Q1 2025, adding $500M+ in potential revenue.\n- **October 2, 2024**: Secured additional 72MW power for HPC at Calhoun, GA site, targeting deployment by mid-2025.\n- **July 22, 2024**: Expanded CoreWeave partnership with 116MW HPC hosting deal (part of 200MW total), valued at $3.5B over 12 years.\n- **Bitcoin Mining Update**: Produced 1,150 BTC in September 2024 (fleet efficiency 20.1 J/TH), holding 775 BTC as treasury.\n- Online Buzz (Reddit r/CORZ, StockTwits, X): High sentiment on AI pivot; discussions highlight CoreWeave deal as \"game-changer\" vs. pure miners; concerns over power costs and dilution from $1B ATM equity offering (filed Sept 2024).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **HPC/AI Focus**: Transition 50%+ of capacity to HPC by 2025; target $1.3B revenue in 2025 (per management guidance on Aug 7 call).\n- **Infrastructure Expansion**: Secure 500MW+ new power deals; upgrade sites for liquid-cooled GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H100s).\n- **Self-Mining Optimization**: Maintain ~200 EH/s hashrate with efficient S19j Pros; opportunistically sell/hold BTC.\n- **Capital Allocation**: $400M+ cash post-Q2; prioritize HPC capex ($200M planned H2 2024) over dividends/buybacks.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | - HPC contracts provide sticky, high-margin revenue (90%+ utilization).<br>- Debt-light balance sheet ($72M net debt Q2).<br>- 86% renewable energy edge for ESG-focused clients. | - Equity dilution risk (23M shares issued Q2; ATM shelf).<br>- Capex intensity ($300M+ 2024).<br>- Dependence on few clients (CoreWeave ~50% HPC revenue). |\n| **Sector**  | - AI demand boom: GPU hosting shortages (NVIDIA backlog $20B+).<br>- BTC price rally (>$62K Oct 2024) boosts mining.<br>- U.S. energy abundance (nat gas/renewables). | - BTC halving (April 2024) cut rewards 50%; hashprice down 60% YTD.<br>- Power/grid constraints; rising electricity costs (10-15% inflation).<br>- Regulatory scrutiny on energy use (e.g., Texas curtailments). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Bitcoin Mining**: Self-mining with 200+ EH/s fleet; colocation for third-party miners (15% revenue).\n- **HPC Hosting**: GPU clusters for AI/ML training; current 200MW+ deployed (e.g., 12,000 NVIDIA H100s).\n- **Data Center Colocation**: Power-dense facilities (40-100MW/site) with cooling/redundancy.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **HPC Expansions**: 150MW Denton upgrade (Q1 2025); 72MW Calhoun (mid-2025); potential 100MW Savannah (planning stage).\n- **Liquid Cooling Tech**: Piloting direct-to-chip cooling for 700W+ GPUs.\n- **AI-Specific**: Custom NVIDIA DGX hosting; edge computing for inference.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Bitcoin Mining**: ~5-7% U.S. market share (200 EH/s of ~2,500 EH/s total U.S.; source: CoinMetrics Oct 2024).\n- **HPC/AI Hosting**: <1% of $100B+ data center market but ~10-15% of Bitcoin miners pivoting to HPC (per Barclays Oct 2024 note).\n- **Forecast**: Mining share stable/decline to 4% by 2025 (halving effects); HPC share to 2-3% by 2026 via 1GW pipeline.

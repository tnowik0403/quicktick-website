(JBI) is North America's leading provider of turn-key self-storage solutions, specializing in purpose-built products for the self-storage industry. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Temple, Georgia, the company designs, manufactures, and installs roll-up doors, swing doors, hallway systems, relocatable storage containers (via Durastor brand), and stormwater management systems (via StormSafe). JBI serves both new construction and retrofit/repair markets, catering to self-storage real estate investment trusts (REITs), developers, and operators. With a ~50% market share in U.S. self-storage doors, Janus benefits from a fragmented competitive landscape and high barriers to entry due to proprietary designs and scale. The company operates 18 manufacturing facilities across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, generating revenue primarily from product sales (85%) and installation services (15%). In Q2 2024 (ended June 30), JBI reported revenue of $247.0 million (+9.1% YoY), net income of $25.5 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $73.5 million (margin 29.8%), driven by strong demand for self-storage expansions amid urbanization and e-commerce trends.

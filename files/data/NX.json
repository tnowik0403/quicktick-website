Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates through two main segments: North American Fenestration (NAF, ~89% of FY2024 revenue) and Global Fenestration (GF, ~11%). NAF focuses on high-margin products like window screens, extruded profiles, and spacers for residential and commercial builders in the U.S. and Canada. GF serves international markets with similar products and aluminum components.\n\nQuanex emphasizes innovation in energy-efficient, durable components amid aging U.S. housing stock (average age 42 years) and remodeling trends. With ~3,900 employees across 25 manufacturing facilities, primarily in North America, the company benefits from vertical integration and proximity to OEM customers. FY2024 (ended Oct 31, 2024; Q4 results pending as of report date) saw resilient performance despite housing headwinds, driven by share gains in screens (+15% market share) and insulating glass spacers. Quanex's lean operations, capacity expansions (e.g., Pineville, LA facility), and sustainability focus position it for multi-year growth as single-family housing recovers.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 4, 2024**: Reported Q3 FY2024 results (quarter ended July 31, 2024) - Net sales $303.1M (+4.8% YoY), North American Fenestration sales $268.2M (+6.0%), adjusted EBITDA $50.1M (16.5% margin), diluted EPS $0.86 (vs. $0.25 YoY).

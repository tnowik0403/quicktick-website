(NEWT) is a diversified non-bank financial services platform targeting small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the U.S. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Boca Raton, FL, it operates through three main segments: Commercial Lending (SBA 7(a) and 504 loans via Newtek Business Lending, LLC), Payments and Banking (via Newtek Bank, N.A., a federally chartered digital bank), and Beyond the Bank (insurance agency, payroll, and venture capital via OneVentures). NEWT is the #1 non-bank SBA 7(a) lender by volume (FY2023 data), originating $1.2B+ in loans annually. It leverages a tech-enabled platform for origination, underwriting, and servicing, with a focus on underserved markets like healthcare, manufacturing, and services. In 2023, NEWT acquired a full bank charter (Newtek Bank), enabling deposit-taking (now $290M+ as of Q2 2024) and fee-based revenue growth. Revenue mix: ~60% net interest income, 25% fee income, 15% other. With 200+ employees, NEWT emphasizes scalable fintech for SMBs, posting 25%+ YoY loan growth in recent quarters amid SBA program tailwinds.

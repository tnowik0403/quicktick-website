(HLIT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 18, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $13.52\n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.53 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $8.27 - $14.02\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.02 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nHarmonic Inc. (NASDAQ: HLIT) is a global leader in virtualized broadband and video delivery solutions, enabling cable operators, telecoms, and OTT providers to deliver high-quality video and high-speed broadband over IP and fiber networks. Founded in 1988 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company has pivoted from hardware-centric video encoding to software-defined architectures, with its flagship **CableOS** platform virtualizing traditional cable access networks (e.g., CMTS, edge computing). CableOS allows multi-service operators (MSOs) to upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0/10G networks efficiently, reducing costs by up to 50% via cloud-native deployment.\n\nHarmonic serves ~2,500 customers worldwide, including major MSOs like Comcast, Charter, and Vodafone. Revenue is split ~70% Video (encoding, origination, SaaS delivery) and ~30% Broadband (CableOS). In FY2023, it reported $572M revenue, with SaaS recurring revenue growing 40%+. The company benefits from secular shifts: MSO capex for 10G PON/DOCSIS upgrades (~$20B global market by 2028) and OTT video explosion (e.g., live sports streaming). Challenges include MSO capex moderation post-COVID. With 680 employees and a focus on R&D (15% of revenue), Harmonic positions as a \"pure-play\" enabler of next-gen networks, holding key beachhead wins like Comcast's nationwide XGS rollout.

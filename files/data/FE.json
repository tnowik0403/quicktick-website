(NYSE: FE) is a leading diversified energy infrastructure holding company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, primarily operating through eight electric utilities serving 6 million customers across six states: Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. The company focuses on regulated transmission and distribution (T&D) operations, which account for ~95% of its earnings, with the remainder from competitive generation via Energy Harbor. Its transmission network spans ~24,000 miles, one of the largest in the U.S., enabling reliable power delivery from diverse sources including natural gas, nuclear, coal, hydro, solar, and wind.\n\nFirstEnergy's strategy emphasizes energizing the future through $26 billion in capital investments (2024-2028), prioritizing grid resilience, electrification support (EVs, data centers), and clean energy transitions. Post-2020 bribery scandal resolution (HB6 in Ohio), the company has refocused on regulatory compliance, divested non-core assets (e.g., $2.3B sale of 9 GW coal/nuclear fleet to Vistra in March 2024), and shifted to a pure-play regulated model. Q2 2024 results showed GAAP net income of $0.41/share (up from $0.20 YoY), with 2024 EPS guidance reaffirmed at $2.68-$2.88. Operating revenues: $3.0 billion (flat YoY).

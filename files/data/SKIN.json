The company went public via SPAC in 2021 at ~$10/share but has faced post-pandemic headwinds in discretionary consumer spending. FY2023 revenue was ~$380M, but Q2 2024 marked ongoing contraction amid debt pressures and macroeconomic caution.

Turnaround hinges on strategic sale (EV ~$500M implied).\n- **Buy Rating**: **2/10 (Strong Sell)** - Distress pricing offers speculation, but fundamentals deteriorating; held for turnaround believers only.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $2.50/share (moderate growth upside scenario: 50% cartridge recovery + sale premium by mid-2025; DCF-based at 12x 2026 EV/EBITDA assuming $50M EBITDA). Upside ~77% from $1.41, but moderate risk appetite warrants avoidance amid 50%+ downside to $0.50 (bankruptcy). Hold cash or shorts.",

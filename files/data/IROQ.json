(NASDAQ: IROQ) is a unitary thrift holding company headquartered in Watseka, Illinois, founded in 1882. It operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association, a full-service community bank with 23 full-service branches across central Illinois and east-central Missouri. The bank focuses on relationship-based banking for individuals, families, and local businesses in rural and semi-rural markets. Core offerings include deposit products (checking, savings, CDs, IRAs), consumer and commercial loans (residential mortgages, home equity, construction, commercial real estate/CRE, multifamily, farmland/agricultural, and business loans). As of June 30, 2024, total assets stood at $1.16 billion, with loans of $802 million (69% CRE-focused) and deposits of $1.01 billion. IROQ emphasizes conservative underwriting, local market expertise, and digital enhancements to compete with larger regionals. It converted from mutual to stock ownership in 2011 and trades on Nasdaq. The company prioritizes shareholder returns via dividends (paid quarterly since 2011) and occasional share repurchases, while pursuing organic growth in underserved Midwest communities amid cyclical banking pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Released FY2024 earnings (year ended June 30, 2024). Net income: $6.8 million ($1.16 diluted EPS), down 27% YoY from $9.4 million due to higher provision for credit losses ($3.0 million vs. $0.5 million) and net interest margin compression to 3.03% from 3.41%. Total revenue: $47.4 million (flat YoY). Non-performing assets rose to 0.81% of loans from 0.18%.\n- **July 23, 2024**: Declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.07/share (payable August 16), maintaining payout amid earnings dip; 11th straight year of dividends.\n- **September 2024**: Announced board approval for up to $2 million stock repurchase program (open-ended), signaling confidence in valuation (1.8x book value).\n- **October 2024 discussions (Seeking Alpha, StockTwits, Yahoo Finance forums)**: Investor chatter highlights CRE exposure risks (69% of portfolio) amid office vacancies, but praises stable deposits (no uninsured deposit flight) and liquidity (125% Texas ratio). No major regulatory issues; CAMELS rating inferred strong from filings.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Organic expansion: Focus on branch optimization (recent closures/consolidations in IL/MO for efficiency) and digital banking upgrades (mobile app enhancements rolled out Q3 2024).\n- Loan portfolio diversification: Targeting ag/business loans (15% of portfolio) to reduce CRE concentration; goal to grow non-CRE to 40% by FY2026 per earnings call.\n- Shareholder value: Consistent dividends + buybacks; aim for ROE >8% (achieved 7.2% FY2024).\n- Entry into adjacent markets: Exploring loan participations with regionals for scale without M&A.\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Category | Key Offerings | Portfolio % (as of 6/30/24) |\n|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| Deposits | Checking, savings, money markets, CDs, IRAs | $1.01B total |\n| Residential Loans | 1-4 family mortgages, home equity | 22% |\n| Commercial Loans | CRE (office/retail/multifamily), construction | 69% |\n| Other Loans | Farmland/ag (10%), business/C&I (5%) | 9% |\n| Fee Income | Wealth management, insurance agency | ~5% of revenue |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Digital transformation**: Q2 FY2025 rollout of enhanced online lending platform for small business loans (<$1M); pilot in 5 branches (announced earnings call 8/6/24).\n- **Ag-focused initiatives**: New variable-rate farmland loan product tied to USDA data, targeting 20% growth in ag book (underserved in Iroquois County, IL).\n- No major capex announced; minor branch remodels in MO (Q4 2024).\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Factor | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High CRE exposure (69%; office subsector vulnerable); elevated provisions ($3M FY24); deposit beta lag in rate cuts. | Stable core deposits (85% <12 months); strong local relationships (low churn); nimble cost control (efficiency ratio 82% FY24). |\n| **Sector (Community Banks)** | Fed rate uncertainty (cuts started 9/18/24 but NIM squeezed); regulatory scrutiny on CRE (FDIC rules); competition from fintechs/big banks for deposits. | Rural demand for ag/relationship lending; potential M&A appeal (1.8x TBV discount to peers); improving economy in IL/MO farm belt. |\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current**: ~1.5% deposit market share in primary markets (Iroquois/Ford Counties, IL; St. Francois County, MO; FDIC/S&P data as of 6/30/24). <0.1% nationally; ranks #15 among ~200 IL thrifts.\n- **Forecast**: Modest growth to 1.8% by 2026 via organic loan/deposit expansion (+3-5% CAGR); potential decline to 1.2% if CRE defaults rise >1%. Bull case: 2.5% with ag pivot and rate relief.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (FY2024 or Latest) | IROQ | Heartland Financial (HTLF) | Old National Bancorp (ONB) | Regional Avg. |\n|---------------------------|------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Assets ($B)              | 1.16 | 23.0                       | 50.3                      | 5-10         |\n| NIM (%)                  | 3.03 | 3.45                       | 3.20                      | 3.20         |\n| ROE (%)                  | 7.2  | 8.1                        | 9.5                       | 8.0          |\n| CRE/Loans (%)            | 69   | 35                         | 28                        | 30           |\n| P/TBV Multiple           | 1.0x | 1.2x                       | 1.3x                      | 1.2x         |\n| **Edge**                 | Local focus, dividends   | Scale, diversification     | M&A growth                | -            |\n\nIROQ trades at discount due to size/CRE risk but outperforms on deposit stability.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Correspondent banking with BMO Harris for wire/treasury; loan participations with HTLF (ongoing since 2022). Insurance via independent agency partnerships.\n- **M&A**: No activity since 2019 branch acquisition; speculative buyout target (speculation on Seeking Alpha 10/2024) by larger Midwest regionals like Wintrust (WTFC).\n- **Major Clients**: Local ag firms (e.g., grain co-ops in Watseka, IL); CRE developers (multifamily in Effingham, IL); no single client >10% revenue. Potential: Expanding to nearby farm credit unions for referrals.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\"); low carbon footprint via rural ops.\n- **Management**: CEO Tom Wright (since 2011) track record of NAV growth; aligned incentives (20% insider ownership).\n- **Risks**: Interest rate sensitivity (duration gap -1.5 yrs); illiquid stock (low float).\n- **Sentiment**: Neutral-positive (Reddit/StockTwits: focus on dividend safety); analyst coverage limited (1 \"Hold\" from Keefe Bruyette, PT $20, 9/2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **5/10 (Hold)** – Balanced for moderate risk; limited upside near-term from CRE headwinds/NIM pressure, but dividend buffer and buyback support floor. Strong growth upside requires rate cuts + ag pivot execution.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $20.00 (18% upside from $16.85). Based on 1.2x FY2025E TBV ($16.50 book, 8% ROE normalized) + 5% dividend discount model; assumes 3% loan growth, NIM to 3.20% by mid-2025. Portfolio fit: Hold for income; buy dips below $16 for growth if Fed cuts deepen.",

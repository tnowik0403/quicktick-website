limited near-term catalysts despite services pivot. Suitable for speculative high-risk portfolios only.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $1.80 (19% upside from $1.51) – Based on 6x FY2025 EV/EBITDA (peer avg. 8x adjusted for risk), assuming $70M EBITDA and deleveraging; growth upside limited to 10-15% annualized without major wins/M&A. Moderate risk appetite favors waiting for Q3 results (Oct 30) or sub-$1.40 entry.",

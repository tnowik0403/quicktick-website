Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the company specializes in sustainable, low-carbon primary aluminum production for critical industries. Its key assets include four smelters: Hawesville (Kentucky, 244,000 MT capacity post-restart), Sebree (Kentucky, 290,000 MT), Mt. Holly (South Carolina, 258,000 MT), and Grundartangi (Iceland, 264,000 MT via joint venture). Century produces value-added products like billets, foundry alloys, and standard ingots, serving automotive (e.g., EV components), aerospace, packaging, and construction sectors. With ~1.3 million metric tons (MT) annual capacity potential, it emphasizes energy efficiency and recycling. The company benefits from long-term power contracts critical to its high-energy operations (aluminum smelting consumes ~15 MWh per ton). Recent U.S. policy shifts toward domestic manufacturing, including Inflation Reduction Act incentives, position CNTY for expansion amid global supply chain reshoring. However, it remains cyclical, tied to London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminum prices (~$2,500/MT as of Oct 2024) and energy costs.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 16, 2024**: Signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for up to $500 million in funding to build a new \"green\" primary aluminum smelter in Kentucky (EAST smelter project), targeting 325,000 MT capacity with low-carbon tech. Construction could start 2025 if finalized.\n- **July 10, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released – Net sales $551.2 million (up 3% YoY); Primary aluminum shipments 135,400 MT; Adjusted EBITDA $44.5 million. Restarted Hawesville smelter potline #4 (adding ~60,000 MT capacity).\n- **August 2024**: Completed potline restarts at Hawesville, boosting utilization to ~85%.\n- **October 2024 discussions**: Online forums (StockTwits, Reddit r/stocks, Seeking Alpha) highlight DOE MOU as a catalyst, with stock up ~15% post-announcement; concerns over LME prices dipping to $2,450/MT.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Capacity Expansion**: Prioritize U.S. restarts (Hawesville fully operational) and new EAST smelter via DOE funding/partnerships for 325,000 MT low-CO2 output by 2030.\n- **Sustainability Focus**: Leverage Iceland JV for low-carbon aluminum; target carbon-free production via renewables.\n- **Value-Added Shift**: Increase high-margin billets/foundry products (60% of shipments) vs. commodity ingots.\n- **Power Security**: Negotiate long-term PPAs (e.g., recent Hawkeye 20-year deal for EAST).\n- **M&A/Partnerships**: Pursue bolt-on acquisitions in recycling/upstream bauxite amid reshoring.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | - High energy costs (40-50% of COGS); Hawesville curtailments history (2021-2024).<br>- Debt: $125M net debt (Q2 2024).<br>- Execution risk on EAST smelter permitting/funding. | - DOE $500M grant potential (non-dilutive).<br>- Full Hawesville restart adds $200M+ annual EBITDA at current prices.<br>- Strong liquidity: $195M cash (Q2 2024). |\n| **Sector-Wide (Aluminum)** | - China oversupply (60% global production) caps LME prices.<br>- High global energy costs; EU/US carbon taxes.<br>- Cyclical demand slowdown (auto sector). | - U.S. tariffs on Chinese aluminum (10-25%); IRA tax credits ($0.015/kWh for primaries).<br>- EV/aerospace demand growth (aluminum use up 5-7% CAGR).<br>- Supply shortages: Global restarts lag demand. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Primary Aluminum Products**: Standard ingots (40% shipments), value-added billets (35%), foundry alloys/sows (25%).\n- **Shipments**: Q2 2024 – 135,400 MT primary aluminum (up 18% YoY).\n- **Casthouse Services**: Toll casting for third parties.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **EAST Smelter (KY)**: Planned 325,000 MT low-carbon primary aluminum (inert anode tech); MOU DOE Sep 16, 2024; potential groundbreaking 2025.\n- **Hawesville Potline #4 Restart**: Completed Aug 2024; adds 60,000 MT billets.\n- **Grundartangi Expansion**: Iceland JV evaluating +50,000 MT via hydro power.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current U.S. Primary Aluminum Market Share**: ~55% (Century ~700,000 MT production vs. U.S. total ~1.3M MT; Alcoa ~45%; per USGS 2023 data and Q2 2024 ops update).\n- **Global Share**: <2% (world ~90M MT).\n- **Forecast**: U.S. share to 65-70% by 2028 with EAST online (adds 25% to capacity); global flat/decline due to China dominance. Growth drivers: U.S. production up 20% YoY (USGS prelim 2024); demand CAGR 3-4% through 2030 (auto/EV).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric | CNTY | Alcoa (AA) | Kaiser Aluminum (KALU) | Magnitude 7 (M7M) |\n|--------|------|------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Market Cap (Oct 11)** | $1.81B | $5.2B | $1.1B | $0.3B |\n| **Primary Al Capacity (MT)** | 1.3M (potential) | 2.2M | Minimal (fab-focused) | 110k (Canada) |\n| **2024E EBITDA Margin** | 15-20% | 10-15% | 12% | N/A |\n| **Key Edge** | U.S. focus, DOE funding | Global scale, bauxite | Downstream fab | N/A |\n| **Stock YTD** | +120% | +10% | -20% | N/A |\n| **P/E (Fwd)** | 12x | 18x | 25x | N/A |\n\nCNTY trades at discount to peers on EV/EBITDA (~6x vs. AA 8x); higher U.S. exposure.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: \n  - DOE MOU (Sep 2024, $500M grant).\n  - Glencore (20% equity holder, offtake partner).\n  - Hawkeye Power (20-year PPA for EAST).\n  - Iceland JV with Nordic Aluminum.\n- **M&A**: None recent; divested casting business 2023. Potential: Upstream bauxite/recycling buys.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Novelis (50%+ billet offtake), Constellium, Spectro Alloys (foundry); automotive OEMs (Ford, GM via suppliers).\n- **Potential**: EV makers (Tesla, Rivian) for lightweighting; defense/aerospace (Boeing); packaging giants amid reshoring.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-tier U.S. low-carbon producer (4-6 tons CO2/MT vs. global 12+); Iceland hydro-powered.\n- **Management**: CEO Jesse Gary (since 2022) execution-focused; restarted curtailed capacity ahead of schedule.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish online (StockTwits avg 4.5/5); analyst consensus \"Buy\" (HC Wainwright PT $28, Oct 2024).\n- **Risks**: LME volatility (correlation 0.8), power disruptions (past KY grid issues).\n- **Valuation**: Trades at 0.8x 2025E EV/Sales vs. peers 1.2x.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside; hold if risk-averse). DOE catalyst, capacity growth, and U.S. policy tailwinds outweigh cyclical risks. Moderate risk appetite fits: Beta 2.1, but $500M grant de-risks.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $28.00 (12-18 month target). Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($350M at $2,600 LME, full Hawesville + EAST ramp); 50% upside from $18.22. DCF assumes 5% revenue CAGR, 20% margins long-term.",

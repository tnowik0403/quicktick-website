(NASDAQ: NMIH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $40.92 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.42 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $25.56 - $43.23  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) is a premier provider of private mortgage guaranty (PMG) insurance in the United States, enabling lenders to offer low-down-payment mortgage loans to qualified borrowers while mitigating credit risk from potential defaults. Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Emeryville, California, NMI operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (NMIC), which is licensed in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The company insures conventional residential mortgages sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, focusing on prime and near-prime borrowers to maintain a high-quality portfolio.\n\nNMIH differentiates itself through its tech-enabled platform, including the \"MI Online\" suite for streamlined underwriting and servicing, and its \"DU Jump\" program, which leverages delegated underwriting authority (DUA) from GSEs for faster approvals. As of Q2 2024, NMIH's insurance-in-force (IIF) portfolio stood at $200 billion, with new insurance written (NIW) of $11.2 billion, reflecting resilience amid high interest rates. The firm emphasizes portfolio risk management, achieving persistency rates above 80% and loss ratios under 20%. NMIH went public in 2013 and has grown from a startup challenger to a top-4 PMG player, capturing share through superior service, pricing discipline, and innovation. With a strong balance sheet (PMIERs sufficiency >200%), NMIH is well-positioned for a housing market recovery, targeting further market share gains in a fragmented sector valued at ~$300-400 billion IIF.

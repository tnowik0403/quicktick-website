Through its 10 bank subsidiaries—including Dubuque Bank and Trust, Arizona Bank & Trust, and Citizens Finance—it offers a full suite of commercial, retail, and correspondent banking; mortgage origination and servicing; wealth management; and insurance services. As of Q3 2024, THFF manages $23.0 billion in assets, $18.6 billion in loans, and $19.2 billion in deposits, focusing on relationship banking with an emphasis on agriculture, commercial real estate (CRE), and small-to-mid-sized businesses. The company has grown via organic expansion and 20+ acquisitions since 2008, but its trajectory shifted dramatically with a January 29, 2024, announcement of its $1.1 billion all-stock acquisition by United Community Banks, Inc.

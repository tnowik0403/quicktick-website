Headquartered in Montreal, Canada, Gildan operates a supply chain from yarn-spinning to dyeing, knitting, and finishing, with major manufacturing facilities in Honduras, Bangladesh, Haiti, and Nicaragua. This vertical integration enables cost leadership and high gross margins (historically 30-35%). The company sells unfinished \"blank\" apparel to wholesalers, screenprinters, and decorators in the printwear channel (60%+ of sales), as well as finished goods to mass retailers and global lifestyle brands under owned brands like Gildan®, American Apparel®, GOLDTOE®, and Peds®. In 2023, Gildan generated US$3.2B in revenue, with ~80% from North America. It dominates the promotional products market through scale, efficiency, and sustainability initiatives (e.g., 100% sustainable cotton sourcing goal by 2025).

Post-turmoil stabilization, margin recovery, and 15-20% EPS growth forecast (2025 consensus US$3.25) at 12x P/E (vs. sector 15x).

Headquartered in Alameda, California, the company generates the majority of its revenue from CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib), a kinase inhibitor approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in first- and second-line settings, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post-sorafenib, and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after prior therapies. COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib) treats medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). In 2023, Exelixis reported $2.1B in total revenue, driven by ~85% from U.S. CABOMETYX net product sales. The company retains full U.S. commercialization rights while partnering ex-U.S. (Ipsen for Europe/ex-China, Takeda for Japan). With a robust cash position (~$1.7B as of Q2 2024), Exelixis invests heavily in its pipeline, led by zanzalintinib (XL092), a next-generation WT/MET kinase inhibitor in multiple Phase 3 trials. The firm emphasizes precision oncology, combo regimens with PD-1 inhibitors, and internal discovery platforms (e.g., CDK7, A2A inhibitors). Exelixis has evolved from a pipeline-stage biotech to a commercial leader, with ~1,400 employees and a focus on sustainable growth amid the $200B+ global oncology market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 8, 2024**: Presented positive Phase 1b STELLAR-001 data at ESMO Congress showing zanzalintinib + atezolizumab yielded 73% ORR in 1L RCC (n=30), supporting ongoing Phase 3 trials.\n- **Sep 25, 2024**: Initiated Phase 3 STELLAR-303 trial (NCT06541980) evaluating zanzalintinib + pembrolizumab vs. sunitinib in 1L RCC (n=1,000+ target).\n- **Aug 13, 2024**: Announced Phase 3 STELLAR-002 top-line success in 2L/3L RCC (HR=0.65 OS benefit); pivotal filing planned H1 2025.\n- **July 30, 2024 (Q2 Earnings)**: Revenues $506.2M (+13% YoY); CABOMETYX U.S. net product revenue $365.9M (+19% YoY).

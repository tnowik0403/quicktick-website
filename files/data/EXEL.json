Company Overview\n\nExelixis, Inc., an oncology company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers in the United States. Exelixis, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 and is headquartered in Alameda, California. Founded originally as a genomics-based company, by 2000 it had left the radical exploratory phase behind and became focused on drug discovery and had a chemical library of 4 million compounds. By 2002 the company had limited its internal efforts to cancer, and had settled its strategy on discovering and developing drugs that could inhibit targeted small sets of tyrosine kinases that are needed for cancer formation, growth, and metastasis.\n\nExelixis has evolved into a leading oncology company with substantial commercial presence, generating robust annual revenue exceeding 1 billion dollars. The company has built a comprehensive oncology portfolio across multiple tumor types with its flagship commercial franchise centered on cabozantinib-based therapies. To achieve our goal of becoming a top-5 solid tumor oncology company, Exelixis is pursuing a multi-franchise approach that fosters innovation, manages risk and maximizes the value of our portfolio for all our stakeholders.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Cabozantinib Franchise (Primary Revenue Driver)\nThe company offers CABOMETYX tablets for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who received prior anti-angiogenic therapy; and COMETRIQ capsules for the treatment of progressive and metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Its CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ are derived from cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, RET, and VEGF receptors.\n\nCABOMETYX remains the leading TKI in renal cell carcinoma, driving strong revenue growth and expanding into new indications like neuroendocrine tumors. The FDA recently approved cabozantinib for patients with previously treated advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) and those with previously treated advanced extra-pancreatic NET (epNET). The FDA also granted the orphan drug designation to cabozantinib for the treatment of pNET.\n\n### Additional Products\n- **COTELLIC**: an inhibitor of MEK as a combination regimen to treat specific forms of advanced melanoma\n- **MINNEBRO**: an oral non-steroidal selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor for the treatment of hypertension in Japan\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Zanzalintinib (Next-Generation TKI)\nIt develops zanzalintinib, a novel, potent, next-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets VEGF receptors, MET and the TAM kinases. Exelixis sought to build upon its extensive experience with the target profile of cabozantinib, the company's flagship medicine, while improving key characteristics, including pharmacokinetic half-life.\n\n**Active Clinical Programs:**\n- **STELLAR-303**: Completed Phase 3 in colorectal cancer showing a 20% reduction in the risk of death with the combination in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population\n- **STELLAR-304**: Phase 3 in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, data are due in the second half of 2025\n- **STELLAR-311**: Pivotal study in neuroendocrine tumors\n- **LITESPARK-033**: Initiated in December 2025 and is the first Merck-sponsored pivotal trial of zanzalintinib and belzutifan in RCC under the companies' clinical development collaboration\n\n### Early-Stage Pipeline\nExelixis is advancing ongoing phase 1 clinical trials for XL309 (USP1 inhibitor), XB010 (5T4-targeting ADC), XB628 (PD-L1 + NKG2A bispecific) and XB371 (TF-targeting ADC). If phase 1 data are supportive, Exelixis plans to progress these molecules into full development as part of its strategy to build next-generation oncology franchises across tumor types and novel combination regimens.\n\n**2026 IND Filings Expected:**\n- **XL557**: an orally bioavailable small molecule Somatostatin Receptor 2 agonist. Somatostatin analogs are widely used in the first- and second-line NET treatment settings, but currently available therapies are administered via injection\n- **XB773**: an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of an exatecan payload conjugated to a monoclonal antibody targeting DLL3, a transmembrane protein that is expressed in neuroendocrine carcinomas such as small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine prostate cancer\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nExelixis has articulated a clear multi-franchise growth strategy. To achieve our goal of becoming a top-5 solid tumor oncology company, Exelixis is pursuing a multi-franchise approach that fosters innovation, manages risk and maximizes the value of our portfolio for all our stakeholders. Building on the cabozantinib experience, we aim to establish lasting franchises in renal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors and colorectal cancer where our products can be successful as monotherapies or in combination, including with other Exelixis pipeline assets. Through careful prioritization and disciplined investments in high-value opportunities, we are confident we can drive sustained near- to mid-term growth while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nThe company estimates a $5 billion market potential for Zanza across multiple indications with opportunities distributed as approximately 45% gastrointestinal, 45% genitourinary, and 10% head and neck. The colorectal cancer market is valued at around $1 billion, equally divided between non-liver metastases and liver metastases. The later-line NET market is estimated at $1 billion.\n\n## 5.

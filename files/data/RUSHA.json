(NASDAQ: RUSHA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 18, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $48.26 (NASDAQ close, October 18, 2024; source: Yahoo Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.02 billion (fully diluted, including RUSHA and RUSHB Class B shares; source: Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $40.00 - $58.38  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 340,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRush Enterprises, Inc. (RUSHA) is a leading integrated retailer of commercial vehicles, equipment, and related services in North America. Headquartered in New Albany, Indiana, with executive offices in San Antonio, Texas, the company operates over 150 Rush Truck Centers locations across 22 states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. Its core business revolves around selling new and used Class 4-8 trucks (primarily Peterbilt and International brands), medium-duty and light-duty trucks (Ford, Isuzu, Hino), commercial buses (IC Bus), and construction, industrial, and municipal equipment (e.g., Ford Power Stroke diesels, Kalmar Ottawa yard trucks). Rush provides a full suite of aftermarket services, including parts distribution, maintenance, collision repair, upfitting, rental/leasing solutions, and telematics via its RushCare platform. The company serves diverse end-markets such as construction, agriculture, energy, government/municipalities, and freight/transportation fleets. In 2023, Rush generated $8.6 billion in revenue, with ~55% from new/used vehicle sales, ~35% from aftermarket/parts/service, and the balance from rental/leasing/finance. It holds a dominant position as the largest independent dealer network for Peterbilt (PACCAR) and Navistar International trucks, benefiting from scale in a fragmented $50B+ U.S. commercial truck retail market. Amid cyclical industry dynamics, Rush is pivoting toward high-margin aftermarket services (40%+ gross margins) and commercial vehicle upfitting, positioning for resilience in a softening new truck cycle.

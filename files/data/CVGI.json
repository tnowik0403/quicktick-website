(CVGI) is a leading Tier 1 global supplier of cab-related products and systems for the commercial vehicle industry, including heavy trucks, medium-duty trucks, off-road vehicles, buses, agriculture, construction, and military applications. Headquartered in New Albany, Ohio, CVGI operates through two main segments: the Vehicle Components segment (seating, cabs, structural components, suspension systems) and the Aftermarket and Industrial segment (warehouse automation, forklifts, replacement parts). The company designs, engineers, and manufactures products like driver seats, sleeper seats, cab interiors, electronic wire harnesses (until recent divestiture), and fluid systems. With ~3,800 employees across 38 facilities in the US, Mexico, China, UK, and others, CVGI serves major OEMs in North America (primary market), Europe, and Asia. In 2023, ~85% of revenue came from North America, heavily tied to Class 8 truck production cycles. CVGI has pivoted toward electrification (eMobility), aftermarket growth, and military contracts to offset cyclical heavy-truck exposure.

Headquartered in Vancouver, BC, Teck operates world-class assets primarily in copper and zinc, with copper production ramping up significantly following the July 2024 divestiture of its steelmaking coal business to Glencore. Key copper operations include the flagship Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 (QB2) mine in Chile (50% owned by Teck), Highland Valley Copper in British Columbia (100%), and Carmen de Andacollo in Chile (22.5% net interest). Zinc production is led by the Red Dog mine in Alaska (100%), one of the world's largest zinc deposits. Teck emphasizes sustainable mining, with strong ESG commitments including water stewardship and biodiversity. Post-coal spin-off (Elk Valley Resources, July 10, 2024), Teck received ~$7.3B in cash and Glencore shares, bolstering its balance sheet (net cash ~$1.5B as of Q2). The company targets 400-450kt annual copper production by 2024-2027 via QB2 ramp-up, positioning it as a Tier 1 copper producer amid tightening global supply.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 10, 2024**: Completed $9B sale of 77% stake in steelmaking coal business (Elk Valley Resources) to Glencore, receiving $6.9B cash + 77.3M Glencore shares (~$430M).

Zinc oversupply pressures prices (-10% YTD). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Copper**: Concentrates from QB2 (Chile), Highland Valley (Canada), Antamina (Peru, 22.5%).\n- **Zinc**: Concentrates/lead from Red Dog (Alaska), Trail smelter (Canada).\n- **Byproducts**: Molybdenum, silver, gold, sulfuric acid.\n- 2024 Guidance: Copper 340-380kt; Zinc 260-290kt.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Quebrada Blanca Phase 2**: Ramp-up phase (ongoing, full capacity 2028).\n- **Zafranal**: Greenfields Cu project, Peru; 24-year life, $1.3B capex.\n- **San Nicolás**: Iron-copper, Mexico; shovel-ready, production 2028.\n- **Highland Valley Renewal**: Life extension to 2040s (permitting advanced).\n\n## Market Share Approximations and Forecast\n- **Current (2024E)**: Global copper ~2.5-3% (Teck ~350kt vs. 22Mt total); Zinc ~5-6% (world #2, ~275kt vs. 13Mt).\n- **Forecast**: Copper market share to 4-5% by 2028 (+50-100% production growth via QB2/Zafranal); Zinc stable/decline to 4% as focus shifts. Driven by 20%+ Cu output CAGR 2024-2028 (per company guidance).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (2024E) | Teck (TE) | Freeport (FCX) | Southern Copper (SCCO) | BHP Copper | Rio Tinto Copper |\n|----------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|------------|------------------|\n| **Cu Prod (kt)** | 360 | 1,600 | 530 | 1,250 | 660 |\n| **C1 Cash Cost ($/lb)** | 1.90 | 1.50 | 1.80 | 1.70 | 2.10 |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 4.5x | 6.2x | 8.1x | 5.0x | 4.8x |\n| **Growth CAGR (Cu 2024-28)** | 20% | 5% | 3% | 4% | 8% |\n| **Key Edge** | Growth + low cost | Scale | Byproducts | Diversified | Portfolio |\n\nTeck trades at discount to peers on growth-adjusted multiples; superior Cu growth vs. incumbents.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Sumitomo (QB2 30%); BlackRock (San Nicolás 50%); Glencore (residual coal ties, shareholder).\n- **M&A**: Coal divestiture (2024); Acquired NewRange copper (2021, 50/50 w/Rio).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Trafigura, Glencore, Mitsubishi (offtake ~50% QB2 production); zinc to Korea Zinc, Nyrstar.\n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding QB2 output targets EV battery supply chain (e.g., Tesla, Ford via refiners).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-quartile DJSI Metals; TSM 30% tailings standard; biodiversity net gain at 80% sites.\n- **Management**: CEO Jonathan Price (since 2023) driving copper pivot; experienced board.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Chile/Peru elections 2025); water rights disputes.\n- **Upside Catalysts**: Cu >$5/lb; Zafranal FID; FCF yield 10%+ at $4.50 Cu.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy for growth portfolios). Rationale: Premium copper assets, 20%+ production growth, copper supercycle tailwinds outweigh zinc weakness/moderate risks. Post-coal purity enhances multiple re-rating (peers 6-8x EV/EBITDA).\n- **Fair Value Price Target**: **$58** (30% upside). Based on 6x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($11B, 15% discount to FCX on superior growth); DCF assumes $4.50/lb Cu long-term, 8% IRR hurdle for moderate risk. Hold if Cu <$4/lb.",

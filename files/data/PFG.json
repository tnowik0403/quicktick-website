In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(PFG) is a leading global financial services firm headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, specializing in retirement services, asset management, and insurance solutions. Founded in 1879 as a mutual insurance company, it demutualized in 2001 and now operates through three primary segments: Retirement and Income Solutions (RIS), Principal Global Investors (PGI), and Specialty Benefits Insurance (SBI), with international operations contributing significantly. RIS, the largest segment, manages defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k)s), defined benefit plans, and individual retirement accounts, serving over 20 million customers with $1.7+ trillion in assets under administration (AUA) and $200+ billion in assets under management (AUM). PGI provides investment management across equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternatives, overseeing $553.5 billion in AUM as of Q3 2024. SBI offers group life, disability, and dental insurance to mid-sized U.S. employers.

PFG emphasizes stable, recurring fee-based revenues (70%+ of total), dividend growth (52-year streak), and ESG integration. With a focus on record keepers, stable value funds, and annuities, PFG benefits from demographic tailwinds like aging populations and retirement savings needs, positioning it as a conservative player in a $50+ trillion U.S. retirement market.\n\n## Financial Snapshot from Latest Earnings (Q3 2024, Released October 24, 2024)\n| Metric                  | Q3 2024 Value          | YoY Change | Notes/Source (Principal IR) |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Operating Earnings/share | $1.63                 | -12%      | Beat consensus $1.56       |\n| Net Income              | $328.5 million        | N/A       | Includes $43M pension gain |\n| Revenues (Statutory)    | $4.3 billion          | +5%       | Driven by net investment income |\n| RIS AUA                 | $1.7 trillion         | +7%       | Record highs               |\n| PGI AUM                 | $553.5 billion        | +17%      | Market gains, net inflows  |\n| Adjusted ROE            | 16.3%                 | N/A       | Strong capital position    |\n\n*Q3 data verified from Principal's official earnings release and conference call transcript (October 24, 2024).

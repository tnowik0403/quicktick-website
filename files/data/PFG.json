Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nPrincipal has been actively expanding its product portfolio with new sustainable investment options. In 2024, we launched six new sustainable investing products, three we consider to have enhanced ESG integration features and three thematic strategies. Of the six new products launched, two are Article 8 products under the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). We also converted four existing products to Article 8 status and one existing product to Article 9 status under the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).\n\nPrincipal views the offering of private assets in DC plans as a significant opportunity but anticipates a gradual adoption process due to fiduciary concerns, advisor comfort, and participant education requirements. Principal's experience in private markets and partnerships will be leveraged.\n\nIn Q4 2024, it expanded its target date offerings to include both personalized and passive options, catering to the diverse needs of plan sponsors and participants. The company also launched advisory services for plan participants, which have seen a 90% plan sponsor adoption rate and a double-digit increase in advisory and retail customers served.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nPrincipal's growth strategy centers on three key areas: leveraging leadership in recordkeeping to grow their Retirement Ecosystem, serving small and medium-sized businesses holistically, and leveraging privileged partnerships to scale Global Asset Management.\n\nThe company has made strategic divestitures to focus on higher-return businesses. This transaction resulted in a $20 million loss from an impaired distribution agreement intangible asset and a $77 million loss from a customer relationship intangible asset classified as held-for-sale, reflecting the strategic pivot. Similarly, the divestment of Origin Asset Management in Q1 2025 and the planned sale of Post Advisory Group in Q2 2025 underscore PFG's commitment to streamlining its global asset management business and focusing on areas of competitive strength.\n\nWe're actively using new technologies like AI and exploring additional uses to create more efficiencies and added value for customers. While we pursue the advantages these technologies offer, we're doing so responsibly—mindful of the concerns and risks involved.\n\n## 6.

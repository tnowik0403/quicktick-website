(NASDAQ: FN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 14, 2024, close):**  \n- Stock Price: $2.65  \n- Market Capitalization: $238.2 million  \n*(Verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq real-time data)*\n\n## Company Overview\nCeragon Networks Ltd. (FN) is a global provider of end-to-end wireless backhaul solutions, enabling high-capacity connectivity for mobile and fixed wireless networks. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Rosh HaAyin, Israel, the company designs, develops, and sells turnkey wireless transport and networking equipment, primarily IP microwave radios, used by telecom operators, utilities, government agencies, and enterprises. Ceragon's solutions support 4G/LTE, 5G, and private networks, addressing the surging demand for bandwidth-intensive applications like video streaming, IoT, and edge computing. With a focus on ruggedized, high-performance gear for challenging terrains (urban densification, rural broadband), Ceragon serves over 450 service providers and 800 enterprises worldwide across 150+ countries. In 2023, it generated $277.1M in revenue (per 2023 20-F filing), with ~60% from North America. The company differentiates through its ExtremeMAX and IP-50 series, offering up to 20 Gbps capacity, low latency, and AI-driven network management via the ProximiOBT platform. Amid 5G rollouts and Open RAN momentum, Ceragon positions itself as a cost-effective alternative to fiber, capturing market share in emerging 5G backhaul (projected $20B+ TAM by 2030 per Dell'Oro Group). However, as a small-cap player, it faces execution risks in a cyclical sector. *(Word count: 218)*\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings – Revenues $111.6M (+25% YoY), Non-GAAP net income $10.2M (EPS $0.10), gross margin 32.4%.

CEO noted \"disciplined\" approach (Q3 call Oct 18, 2024); potential bolt-ons in FL/TX.\n- **Major Clients**: Energy (e.g., upstream O&G in TX/LA, undisclosed but 25% C&I exposure); healthcare (MS/AL hospitals); gaming/tourism (Biloxi casinos). Potential: Tech firms in Houston (via C&I pipeline +$300M Q3).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\" 2024); net-zero carbon banking pledge (2023).\n- **Management**: CEO John Hairston (since 2017) praised for capital discipline (Seeking Alpha Oct 2024).\n- **Risk Profile**: Low securities losses (ALCO mgmt); stress test pass (annual).\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 10 Buy/4 Hold (avg. PT $52.50, Barclays Oct 21, 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy – Hold current positions, initiate on dips below $47). Rationale: Q3 beat + NIM tailwinds from rate cuts support 10-15% EPS growth 2025; undervalued vs. peers (P/TB 1.45x < historical 1.6x); moderate CRE risk offset by coverage/reserves. Sector recovery favors quality regionals like HWC.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $58 (20% upside). DCF-based (8% growth taper, 11% COE, 3% terminal); aligns with 1.7x TBV target ($34 BVPS Q3). Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios (moderate risk: beta 1.1, CET1 buffer).",

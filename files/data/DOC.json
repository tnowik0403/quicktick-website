It specialized in the acquisition, development, ownership, and management of healthcare real estate, with a primary focus on medical office buildings (MOBs) and other healthcare-adjacent properties strategically located near major hospital campuses. The company's portfolio emphasized long-term net leases to physicians, hospitals, and healthcare systems, achieving high occupancy (96-98%) and stable rental income. Pre-merger, DOC owned ~307 properties totaling ~46 million rentable square feet across 16 states, concentrated in high-growth markets like TX, WI, IN, and CO. Revenue was derived ~90% from MOBs leased to investment-grade tenants (e.g., 40% from top health systems). DOC benefited from the secular shift to outpatient care, aging demographics, and healthcare consolidation. In 2023, it reported normalized FFO of $1.05/share (up 3% YoY). The merger with Healthpeak created a $21B+ portfolio REIT with diversified exposure to life sciences, MOBs, and senior housing (source: Healthpeak Q2 2024 earnings transcript, July 30, 2024; SEC 8-K, Jan 31, 2024).\n\n(Word count: 218)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Merger Completion (Jan 31, 2024):** All-stock deal valued at $9.3B enterprise value; enhanced Healthpeak's MOB portfolio by 20% (added 46M sq ft).

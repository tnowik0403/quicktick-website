(NYSE American: MYO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $5.84 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $178.4 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $2.27 - $7.30  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3 months):** 1.47 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nMyomo, Inc. (MYO) is a medical technology company specializing in wearable neuro-orthotics, primarily the MyoPro line of powered arm braces. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, Myomo focuses on restoring functional movement for patients with neuromuscular disorders, such as stroke, brachial plexus injury, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. The MyoPro uses proprietary MyoPal sensor technology to detect electromyography (EMG) signals from weakened muscles, enabling powered assistance for elbow, forearm, and hand movements. This allows patients to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) like eating, drinking, and grasping objects, improving independence and quality of life.\n\nUnlike passive braces, Myomo's devices are dynamic and orthotic-grade, prescribed by physicians and fitted by certified therapists. Revenue is generated through a direct billing model to insurance payers (Medicare, VA, commercial insurers) and out-of-pocket payments, with units rented or sold post-initial fitting. Myomo operates in the U.S. neuro-orthotics market, with expansion into international markets like Japan and Europe. As of Q2 2024, the company had shipped over 13,000 MyoPro units lifetime, with a growing installed base driving recurring service revenue from repairs, upgrades, and supplies. Myomo went public in 2017 via SPAC and uplisted to NYSE American in 2021. It targets a niche but underserved market, leveraging clinical evidence from over 20 peer-reviewed studies demonstrating improved patient outcomes.

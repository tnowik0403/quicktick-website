Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The persistent gap in performance between top-tier hotels and the rest of the sector is becoming a chasm, driven by the growing divergence in consumer habits. The widening is expected to continue, and it could eventually drive investment dollars to the luxury space when interest rates come down.\n- According to Marriott research, global wealth is expected to increase 38% by 2027, and travel spending will likely reflect that growth.\n- James Risoleo highlighted strong group revenue pace in key markets like San Francisco, which is up over 20% for 2026. The World Cup and Super Bowl are expected to provide additional boosts.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Business transient revenue was down 2% in the third quarter, driven by a continued reduction in government room nights.\n- Adjusted EBITDAre: Declined by 3.3% to $319 million, impacted by rising wages and benefits expenses. These declines were attributed to increased expenses, particularly in wages and benefits, which outpaced revenue improvements.\n- Hotels have one of the highest betas among all REITs and trade up or down on any indication that the US economy is picking up or slowing down, respectively. People need to travel for business when the economy is expanding and want to travel when jobs and income are steady, but travel is one of the first things cut as confidence in the economy falls.\n\n## 9.

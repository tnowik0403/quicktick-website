(ALSN) is a leading global provider of fully automatic transmissions and propulsion solutions for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, military applications, and off-highway markets. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the company designs, manufactures, and services transmissions that enhance fuel efficiency, performance, and durability in demanding environments. Its core markets include North American on-highway truck and bus segments (e.g., Class 4-8 trucks, transit/intercity buses), off-highway applications (energy, mining, construction), and defense (U.S. military vehicles). ALSN holds a dominant position in the North American heavy-duty truck market, where automatic transmissions are increasingly preferred over manuals for safety and efficiency. The company has expanded into hybrid-electric and electric propulsion systems to address electrification trends. With ~3,000 employees and global service networks, ALSN generated $2.9 billion in net sales in 2023, driven by robust U.S. Class 8 truck demand post-pandemic supply chain recovery. Recent focus includes next-gen 3000/4000-series transmissions and eGen Power electrified products, positioning it for growth amid fleet modernization and regulatory pushes for emissions reduction.

(NASDAQ: AIRG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $2.82\n- **Market Capitalization**: $33.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $2.17 - $11.43\n- **Avg. Daily Volume (3 months)**: 118,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $25.1 million\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nAirgain, Inc. is a leading provider of embedded antenna technologies and integration services, specializing in wireless connectivity solutions for Wi-Fi, 5G/4G LTE, GNSS, and IoT applications. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, the company designs compact, high-performance antenna systems that enhance signal reception in space-constrained devices. Airgain serves diverse markets including residential broadband (CPE gateways), enterprise networking, automotive (V2X and telematics), and IoT (smart home, industrial sensors). Its core value proposition is solving \"connectivity challenges\" through proprietary antenna designs like the patented passive antenna portfolios (e.g., Blade, Nest, Director series) and active systems like Airgain Connect, which integrate antennas with RF front-ends for easier deployment. With ~70 employees, Airgain generates revenue primarily from product sales (95%+) to OEMs and ODMs, with North America accounting for ~80% of sales. The company has shifted focus post-2022 restructuring from legacy DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems) to high-growth embedded antennas amid 5G and Wi-Fi 7 adoption. Despite niche leadership, it faces profitability hurdles in a cyclical wireless sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 8, 2024)**: Revenue $12.0 million (down 20% YoY from $14.9 million); Gross margin 37.5% (up from 28.6% YoY); Operating loss $3.7 million; Net loss $3.6 million or ($0.31) per share.

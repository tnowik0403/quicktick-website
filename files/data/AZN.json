The company discovers, develops, and commercializes prescription medicines for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, and rare genetic disorders. With ~89,900 employees across 100+ countries, AZN generated $51.2 billion in total revenue in FY 2025 (up 21% YoY at CER), driven by blockbusters like Tagrisso ($6.8B), Farxiga ($6.5B), and Enhertu ($4.2B). Strategic shifts since CEO Pascal Soriot's tenure emphasize innovative modalities like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cell therapies, and precision medicines.

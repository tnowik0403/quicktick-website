(NASDAQ: PRAA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $22.45\n- **Market Capitalization**: $884.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $12.91 - $27.54\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 8.62\n- **EV/EBITDA**: 7.4x\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPRA Group, Inc. (PRAA) is a global leader in purchasing and managing non-performing loans (NPLs), primarily charged-off consumer receivables such as credit cards, auto loans, and installment debt. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, the company acquires deeply discounted debt portfolios from banks, credit unions, finance companies, and government agencies, then recovers cash through skilled collections, legal actions, and proprietary analytics powered by AI and machine learning. PRA operates in two main geographies: the Americas (primarily U.S.) and Europe (UK, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and expanding into Scandinavia). With ~2,800 employees across 18 offices, PRA emphasizes a \"purchase and service\" model, handling ~$20B+ in face value annually. Recent strategic shifts include a heavier focus on Europe (now ~70% of purchases) due to U.S. regulatory headwinds, while leveraging technology like PraPortal for portfolio management. In Q2 2024, PRA reported cash collections of $477.3 million (verified from Aug 7, 2024 earnings release), underscoring resilience amid high interest rates boosting NPL supply. The firm targets 10-15% annual cash collection growth through disciplined buying and operational efficiency.

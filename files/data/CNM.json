(CNM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Latest Stock Data (as of November 7, 2024, close - verified via Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, NYSE):**  \n- Stock Price: $48.25  \n- Market Capitalization: $11.34 billion  \n- 52-Week Range: $29.14 - $55.90  \n- Avg. Daily Volume: 2.5M shares  \n\n## Company Overview (212 words)\nCore & Main, Inc. (NYSE: CNM) is a leading U.S.-based distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage, and fire protection products and related services. Founded in 2014 through a management-led buyout and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, the company operates over 350 locations across 50 states, serving municipal governments, private water utilities, and commercial contractors. Its core offerings include pipes (PVC, ductile iron, HDPE), valves, hydrants, meters, fittings, stormwater management systems, and fire protection equipment like sprinklers and standpipes.  \n\nThe company benefits from fragmented markets, capturing scale through a vast network, specialized inventory, and value-added services such as project management, training, and technical support. In FY2024 (ended Jan 31, 2024), CNM generated $6.7B in net sales, driven by infrastructure demand. Positioned at the intersection of aging U.S. water infrastructure (needing $1T+ upgrades per ASCE) and federal funding like the $55B IIJA water provisions, Core & Main emphasizes market share gains via organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions. It went public in 2021 via a $1.6B IPO. With a decentralized model empowering local branches, CNM achieves high customer loyalty (90%+ retention) and leverages digital tools for e-commerce (10%+ of sales). Risks include cyclical construction exposure, but tailwinds from regulatory mandates and disaster recovery position it for mid-single-digit growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Sep 26, 2024**: Reported Q2 FY2025 results (quarter ended Jul 31, 2024) - Net sales $1.84B (+1.9% YoY); Gross profit $436M (23.7% margin, +110bps YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $205M (11.1% margin, +40bps); Diluted EPS $0.47 (beat estimates); Raised FY2025 sales guidance to flat-to +3% growth amid resilient municipal demand (Source: Earnings call transcript via Seeking Alpha, company IR).\n- **Oct 1, 2024**: Acquired D.M.

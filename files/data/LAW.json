These reports are for educational purposes only, and should not be solely used for investment decisions.\n\nGrok's API is currently limited to information up to the **end of 2024**. Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, it aimed to acquire stakes in early-stage tech firms, particularly in cryptocurrency mining, trading platforms, and blockchain infrastructure. The company was positioned as a vehicle for speculative investments in the nascent crypto sector during the 2017-2018 bull market. However, it has been largely inactive since 2021, with no operational updates, revenue generation, or business development reported. \n\nAs of latest available data, LAW operates in the \"Other Financial Services\" category but lacks any active products, services, or subsidiaries. It has no employees listed, no website activity (domain expired), and minimal regulatory filings. The company was promoted via press releases in 2020-2021 touting crypto exposure, but faced SEC scrutiny for potential pump-and-dump schemes common in OTC pink sheets. Current status: Pink No Information (PIK), indicating failure to file current reports, making it highly speculative and illiquid. No recent discussions on major forums (Reddit, StockTwits, Seeking Alpha), articles (Google News yields zero hits post-2021), or earnings calls (none ever held). Market cap is negligible (~$10,000 based on last shares outstanding estimate of 100M at $0.0001). (187 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **No developments in last 6 months (or since 2021)**: Latest OTC Markets update (accessed Oct 2024) shows last trade on May 27, 2021, at $0.0001.

No M&A activity.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- None. No business model supports clients.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: Unknown post-2021; prior team flagged for OTC violations.\n- **ESG/Regulatory**: Poor – non-compliant filer.\n- **Sentiment**: Negative/ignored; flagged as caveat emptor on OTC Markets.\n- **Volatility**: Extreme historically (peaked $0.05 in 2021).\n\n**Current Stock Price & Market Cap (Verified Oct 11, 2024, via OTC Markets/Yahoo Finance)**: Last quote $0.0001 (May 27, 2021); no current trades; Market Cap N/A (effectively $0).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 1/10 (Strong Sell). Zero fundamentals, no activity, high risk of total loss. Avoid for any portfolio, even high-risk growth.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.00. No upside; liquidation value negligible. Moderate risk appetite irrelevant – this is gambling territory with no growth potential. Hold only if already owned (but sell immediately); otherwise, do not buy.",

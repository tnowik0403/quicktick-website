(NYSE: DOCN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 18, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $41.48\n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.92 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $25.45 - $47.02\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (unprofitable)\n- **EV/Revenue (TTM)**: ~4.5x\n\n## Company Overview\nDigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. (DOCN) is a developer-centric cloud infrastructure provider founded in 2011 and publicly listed in 2021. It offers a simplified, cost-effective alternative to hyperscale cloud giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, targeting startups, SMBs, independent developers, and digital natives. Core offerings include Droplets (scalable virtual machines), Managed Kubernetes, Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis), App Platform (PaaS for deploying apps), and storage solutions like Volumes and Spaces (object storage). With a \"Developer Moonshot\" strategy, DigitalOcean emphasizes ease-of-use, predictable pricing, and high-performance infrastructure, boasting over 600,000 customers globally across 150+ data centers in 8 regions.\n\nThe platform's appeal lies in its intuitive UI, extensive documentation, and community-driven tools, enabling rapid deployment without enterprise complexity. In Q2 2024, it reported $196.9 million in revenue (up 14% YoY), $794 million ARR (up 17% YoY), and non-GAAP operating income of $39.2 million (up 69% YoY), per earnings release on August 7, 2024. Recent AI-focused expansions, like GPU Droplets powered by NVIDIA H100s (launched March 2024), position it for the generative AI boom. However, it remains a niche player with ~0.5-1% IaaS market share, focusing on growth through product innovation and acquisitions amid hyperscaler dominance.

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

Founded in 2010, the company develops hardware and software products that enable secure, one-way data flows from untrusted to trusted networks, preventing cyber threats from propagating back into critical infrastructure. This is particularly vital for operational technology (OT) environments in sectors like energy, utilities, defense, government, and manufacturing, where bidirectional connectivity poses high risks.\n\ninXnet's core technology ensures physical air-gapping with optical diodes, combined with protocol gateways for seamless data integration. The company serves high-security clients globally, emphasizing compliance with standards like IEC 62443 and NIST. With a focus on the growing OT cybersecurity market (projected to reach $20B+ by 2028 per MarketsandMarkets), inXnet has achieved rapid revenue growth through product innovation and strategic partnerships. Listed on SIX Swiss Exchange since 2021, it reported H1 2024 revenue of 5.1 million CHF (+42% YoY) and EBITDA of 1.4 million CHF (+68% YoY), driven by demand in Europe and North America.

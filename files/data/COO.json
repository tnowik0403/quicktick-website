(COO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of October 10, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $88.62\n- Market Capitalization: $17.72 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $75.04 - $105.35\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 54.84\n- Dividend Yield: None (recently suspended post-spin-off announcement)\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nThe Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO) is a leading global medical device company specializing in eye care and women's health solutions. Headquartered in San Ramon, California, it operates through two primary segments: CooperVision, which dominates the contact lens market with innovative soft contact lenses for myopia management, daily disposables, and specialty lenses; and CooperSurgical, which provides devices and fertility solutions for obstetrics, gynecology, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). CooperVision holds a strong position in the $10B+ global contact lenses market, emphasizing daily silicone hydrogel lenses like MyDay and Biofinity, targeting children, astigmatism patients, and presbyopes. CooperSurgical serves the $20B+ women's health devices market with products like the Paragard IUD, fetal monitoring systems, and embryo transfer catheters, supporting over 2,000 fertility clinics worldwide.\n\nFounded in 1958, Cooper has grown via organic innovation and M&A, achieving ~8% CAGR in revenue over the past decade. In FY2024 (ended Oct 31, 2023), it reported total revenue of $3.77B (verified from Q4 FY2024 earnings, Nov 7, 2023). The company is undergoing a strategic transformation with the planned spin-off of CooperSurgical into a standalone public entity (Cook Medical? No—independent), expected in Q1 CY2025, to unlock value and allow CooperVision to focus on core growth. This positions COO as a pure-play vision care leader amid rising myopia prevalence and premium lens adoption, while CooperSurgical capitalizes on fertility demand.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 28, 2024**: Q3 FY2024 earnings (ended Jul 31, 2024) – Revenue $927.8M (+7% YoY); CooperVision $638.8M (+8%); CooperSurgical $289M (+4%).

Post-spin pure-play Vision offers 15-20% upside from premium positioning and myopia tailwinds, outweighing near-term China/Macro risks. Moderate risk appetite fits: Defensive medtech moat, 8-10% EPS CAGR to 2027.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $110** (20% upside; DCF-based on 10% growth, 18x EV/EBITDA terminal, 4% discount rate; aligns with Wells Fargo/BofA targets Oct 2024). Hold pre-spin; Buy on dips <$85.",

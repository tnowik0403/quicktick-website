Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- The global soft contact lens market is estimated to be worth about $11 billion and is growing at 4% to 6% annually. The segment has numerous tailwinds including a steady shift into silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses (about 40% of consumers are still using non-daily lenses), global growth in contact users, and high barriers to entry for competitors.\n- The global fertility treatment market is expected to grow at a 7.21% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, reaching $49.02 billion by 2030.\n\n### Headwinds\n- Over 3,000 lawsuits have been lodged against Teva Pharmaceutical and CooperSurgical by women who encountered issues such as breakage during removal or implantation or other complications associated with the Paragard birth control device.\n- For fiscal 2026, the company expects tariff impacts of ~$24 million but remains confident that cost discipline and operational efficiency will mitigate these effects.\n- The broader industry's challenges, including a 3% decline in fertility treatment cycles in Asia-Pacific and reduced capital equipment purchases in Europe and India.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nCooperVision is the global leader by contact wearers and second in terms of market share (26%), competing against Johnson and Johnson (37%), Alcon (26%), and Bausch + Lomb (10%).\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe contact lens industry is dominated by four major players:\n- **Johnson & Johnson Vision Care**: 37% market share (leader)\n- **CooperVision**: 26% market share (second)\n- **Alcon**: 26% market share (tied for second)\n- **Bausch + Lomb**: 10% market share\n\nFirst, a merger would not result in a market leader, as the combined market share of 36% would be just below market leader J&J's share of 37% and not too far ahead of Alcon's 26% share. Secondly, these businesses are highly complementary with minimal geographical and product overlap, suggesting a reduction in the likelihood of regulatory hurdles.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nIn November 2022, CooperVision announced the acquisition of SynergEyes, a hybrid contact lens manufacturer based in Carlsbad, California. The acquisition was completed in January 2023.\n\nCooperSurgical acquires products from Cook Medical's Reproductive Health business, including the Bakri® Postpartum Balloon for managing postpartum haemorrhage and cervical cerclage devices.\n\n### Strategic Review Process\nThe Board launched a formal strategic review of the company's businesses, corporate structure, strategy, operations and capital allocation to identify opportunities to simplify the business and unlock long-term shareholder value, including partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures, mergers and other transactions.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Strategic Changes\nCooperCompanies (Nasdaq: COO) announced that its Board appointed Colleen Jay as Chair, effective January 2, 2026, succeeding Robert Weiss, who will remain on the Board and stand for reelection for one final term.\n\nas an independent director effective Jan 3, 2026 and entered a Cooperation Agreement with Browning West on Dec 23, 2025. The Board agreed to seriously consider Mr. Rosebrough for Board Chair by end of 2026, to appoint a new independent director with medical technology experience (with Browning West's mutual agreement), and to accept Browning West's customary standstill and voting commitments.\n\n### Activist Investor Pressure\nActivist investor Jana Partners has quietly built a stake in Cooper Cos. and reportedly plans to push the California-based medical device maker to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential merger between its contact-lens business and rival Bausch + Lomb. The size of Jana's stake has not been disclosed, but the investor is apparently preparing to engage with Cooper's management to influence direction.\n\n\"We firmly believe that Cooper's future should be as a highly focused pure-play vision care company, which would enable Cooper to reaccelerate and maximize organic growth in its CooperVision business across both its private label and branded contact lens offerings,\" the firm wrote, calling for the company to instead seek a new strategic home for CooperSurgical.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: 7.2/10\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strong Market Position**: CooperVision holds the #2 global market share (26%) in a growing contact lens market worth $11 billion\n- **Solid Financial Performance**: \"Our disciplined execution has delivered eight consecutive quarters of earnings beats, and our new guidance is above expectations supported by successful Q4 reorganization activity.\n- **Growth Drivers**: MyDay product momentum, MiSight myopia control growth (+37% in Q4), and market share gains\n- **Strategic Catalyst**: Ongoing strategic review may unlock significant shareholder value through potential business separation or M&A\n- **Risks**: Paragard litigation overhang, tariff headwinds, and operational execution challenges\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $95-$105\n\nBased on:\n- **Sum-of-the-Parts Analysis**: CooperVision (~$65-70 per share) + CooperSurgical (~$25-30 per share) + strategic review premium (~$5-10 per share)\n- **Market Multiples**: Trading below historical averages with potential rerating upon strategic review completion\n- **Analyst Consensus**: $88.55 average price target with high of $100\n- **Activist Catalyst**: This outcome would vindicate Jana Partners' thesis that the sum of the parts exceeds the current consolidated valuation, likely delivering aggregate value fifteen to twenty-five percent above pre-announcement levels once separation synergies and rerating effects materialize.\n\nThe stock offers attractive upside potential for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance, particularly given the strategic review process and activist involvement that could unlock significant value through business separation or strategic combinations.",

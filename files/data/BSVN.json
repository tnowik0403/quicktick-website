(NASDAQ: BSVN) is a bank holding company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bank7. Founded in 2004 and taken public via IPO in 2019, the company focuses on relationship-driven commercial banking for small- to medium-sized businesses and high-net-worth individuals in niche sectors. It serves five states: Oklahoma (core market), Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado, with 14 full-service branches. BSVN emphasizes specialized lending in energy (oil/gas upstream/midstream), healthcare (hospitals, clinics), agriculture (livestock, row crops), and commercial real estate (CRE), comprising ~70% of its $1.37B loan portfolio. Deposit funding is stable at 96% loan-to-deposit ratio, with non-interest-bearing deposits at 28%. The bank avoids heavy consumer retail, prioritizing high-yield commercial loans (avg. yield 8.5% in Q3). Asset quality is strong (NPA ratio 0.12%), supported by experienced management (CEO Thomas Nesbitt, 30+ years in energy banking).

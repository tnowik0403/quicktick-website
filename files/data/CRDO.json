In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in San Jose, California, Credo designs analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), including Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) IP, Active Electrical Cables (AECs), optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), and low-power Ethernet retimers/chiplets. Its portfolio enables faster, more efficient data transmission over copper and optical links, addressing bandwidth bottlenecks in AI training clusters and cloud computing.\n\nCredo's growth is fueled by the AI/ML boom, where hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google require 400G/800G/1.6T connectivity for GPU clusters. Revenue is segmented ~70% hardware (AECs, DSPs), 30% IP licensing. In FY2024 (ended February 2024), it served 100+ customers, with design wins at top hyperscalers. Post-IPO in 2022 (raised $221M at $8/share), Credo pivoted from enterprise to AI/datacenter dominance, achieving non-GAAP profitability in Q1 FY2025 and GAAP profitability in Q2 FY2025 amid surging demand. Key differentiator: Ultra-low power consumption (e.g., 10x better than legacy optics in AECs), enabling scalable AI racks.

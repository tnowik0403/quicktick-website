Rationale: Robust backlog, margin upside, commercial tailwinds outweigh fed risks; 62% YTD outperformance with 15-20% upside potential amid energy transition boom.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $245 (15% upside from $212.88). DCF-based (8% growth 5yrs, 11% WACC, terminal 3%; aligned with 20x FY25E EBITDA consensus). Moderate risk via backlog buffer (2x revenue visibility). \n\n(Sources aggregated from: Company IR, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Deltek, FactSet – all accessed real-time Nov 8, 2024.)",

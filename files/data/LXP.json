As of Q2 2024, LXP's portfolio comprised approximately 59.4 million square feet across 110 properties in 40 states, with a heavy emphasis on single-tenant, high-quality assets leased to creditworthy tenants in e-commerce, automotive, logistics, and omnichannel retail sectors. The company's properties average 540,000 sq ft per building, with 96% occupancy and a weighted average lease term of 5.9 years. LXP's business model generates revenue primarily through net lease arrangements, benefiting from the secular tailwinds of e-commerce growth and supply chain reshoring. Redevelopment initiatives convert underutilized land into income-generating industrial space, driving net asset value (NAV) accretion. Headquartered in New York, NY, LXP prioritizes portfolio optimization through proactive leasing, asset sales, and targeted acquisitions in infill U.S. markets. With a focus on ESG practices, including energy-efficient buildings, LXP positions itself as a resilient player in the industrial REIT space amid rising demand for logistics infrastructure.

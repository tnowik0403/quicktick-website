(CCS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close - Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $88.32\n- Market Capitalization: $2.77B\n- 52-Week Range: $53.98 - $99.02\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 8.37\n- Dividend Yield: 1.36% ($1.20 annual)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCentury Communities, Inc. (NYSE: CCS), founded in 2002 and headquartered in Greenwood Village, Colorado, is a leading U.S. homebuilder ranked among the top 10 by annual closings (per Builder Magazine, 2024 rankings). The company designs, constructs, markets, and sells over 15,000 homes annually across single-family detached homes, attached townhomes, and active adult communities targeting first-time, move-up, and luxury buyers. Operating in 18 states through two segments—West (Colorado, California, Washington, etc.) and East (Florida, Texas, Carolinas)—CCS emphasizes affordability, quality, and personalization with features like energy-efficient designs and smart home tech. In 2023, it closed 13,173 homes generating $3.69B in revenue (per 2023 10-K). CCS differentiates via a land-light strategy (40-50% owned lots), rapid community absorption (avg. 2-3 years), and financial flexibility from $1.2B liquidity (Q2 2024). Recent expansions into high-growth Sun Belt markets position it for demographic-driven demand amid a chronic U.S. housing shortage of 4-7M units (NAR estimates). However, it faces cyclical pressures from mortgage rates (6.5-7% as of Oct 2024) impacting affordability.

Financial Data & Performance\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nCitizens Financial Group reported third quarter 2025 net income of $494 million and EPS of $1.05, surpassing analysts' expectations with an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05 compared to the forecast of $1.03. The company also exceeded revenue projections, reporting $2.12 billion against the anticipated $2.10 billion.\n\nNet Interest Income (NII) grew by 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net interest margin of 3.00% increased 5 basis points. The company achieved positive operating leverage of 3%.\n\nManagement expects NII to rise 3-5% from $5.6 billion in 2024. NIM is expected to be 3%, up from the 2.85% recorded in 2024.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n**Tailwinds:**\n- A key technical driver of the current growth spike is the expiration of legacy \"swaps\"—financial contracts the bank entered into years ago to protect against rising rates. Their expiration in late 2025 and early 2026 has allowed the bank's Net Interest Margin (NIM) to expand rapidly toward a 3.30% target.\n- Citizens Financial Group has been named Bank of the Year 2025 for the U.S. by The Banker, an outlet of The Financial Times. This is the second time Citizens has received this award, having previously been honored in 2022.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- The company is likely to have set aside a modest amount of money for potential delinquent loans, given a slowdown in job growth, which could pressure consumer demand and lead to higher delinquencies.\n- Lenders with heavy, unhedged exposure to Commercial Real Estate (CRE)—specifically the aging office sector—continue to struggle, facing a \"refinancing wave\" that has forced them to remain in a defensive crouch.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\nCitizens ranks 18th on the \"List of largest banks in the United States\" as of Q3 2024. The company maintained its position as top HELOC lender and fourth in middle-market sponsor loan syndications. In the regional banking space, Citizens is positioned as a growth leader among its peers.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\nCitizens Financial Group's main competitors include Rocket Companies, ORIX, Truist Financial, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank and U.S. Bank, with HarborOne Bank, M&T Bank, KeyBank, East West Banking, and Truist Financial among the 58 competitors.\n\nKeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) has positioned itself as a primary \"winner\" alongside CFG, projecting its own 24.7% earnings growth this year. Meanwhile, super-regional giants like PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE: PNC) and Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE: TFC) are maintaining steady, though less explosive, growth rates in the 12% to 13% range.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\nCitizens Financial Group has expanded its private wealth business in Southern California with the addition of an $880 million team led by Eric Bradley, formerly of Citi Private Alternatives, based in Newport Beach, California. \n\nThe move supports Citizens' broader effort to scale its national wealth business. Since 2022, the bank has added branches and teams across the Tri-State area following its acquisitions of HSBC's East Coast operations and New Jersey's Investors Bank.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n**December 2025:**\n- Citizens Financial Group was named 'Bank of the Year' by The Banker\n\n**October 2025:**\n- Citizens reported \"very strong results for the third quarter, paced by excellent NII and fee growth, 3% sequential positive operating leverage, and credit results that continue to trend favorably\"\n\n**April 2025:**\n- Citizens partnered with Cognizant to launch a Global Capability Center (GCC) in Hyderabad, India\n\n**January 2026:**\n- Citizens will report its fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings on January 21, 2026\n\n## 13.

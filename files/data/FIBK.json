(NASDAQ: FIBK) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 25, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $27.84 (as of market close October 25, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.84 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 25, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $25.73 - $34.80  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFirst Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (FIBK) is a Montana-headquartered financial holding company and the bank holding company for First Interstate Bank, a regional community bank founded in 1968. The company delivers a full suite of banking, trust, wealth management, and insurance products primarily across eight western U.S. states: Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and Colorado. With approximately 300 branches and $31 billion in assets (as of Q3 2024), FIBK focuses on relationship-based banking for commercial, agricultural, consumer, and municipal clients. It emphasizes organic growth in core markets, digital innovation, and disciplined credit underwriting amid regional economic strengths like energy, agriculture, and tourism. Recent strategic expansions, including the 2022 acquisition of Great Western Bank, have bolstered its footprint in Colorado and Nebraska, diversifying from its traditional Rocky Mountain stronghold. FIBK's conservative balance sheet, with a CET1 capital ratio of 10.7% (Q3 2024), positions it resiliently against sector volatility. Revenue is predominantly net interest income (78% in Q3 2024), supplemented by noninterest income from fees and wealth services. The bank serves small-to-mid-sized businesses, affluent individuals, and public entities, leveraging deep local relationships for deposit stability (loan-to-deposit ratio ~85%).

(RIG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Date of Report:** October 4, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $4.28 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 4, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.62 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 4, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $4.05 - $8.70  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nTransocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) is the world's largest offshore drilling contractor, specializing in contract drilling services for oil and natural gas exploration and production. Headquartered in Steinhausen, Switzerland, with primary operations in the U.S., the company owns and operates a high-specification fleet of 37 mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) as of Q2 2024, including 27 ultra-deepwater floaters (capable of drilling in water depths >7,500 ft), 5 harsh environment floaters (designed for severe North Sea conditions), and 5 midwater floaters. Transocean serves major integrated oil companies (IOCs), national oil companies (NOCs), and independent operators, focusing on complex, high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) wells in deepwater and ultra-deepwater environments.  \n\nThe company generates revenue through dayrate contracts, with backlog visibility providing revenue stability. As of July 31, 2024, contract drilling backlog stood at $8.8 billion through 2027, with 82% utilization in Q2 2024. Transocean emphasizes fleet modernization, having divested older assets and reactivated high-spec rigs like Deepwater Titan (Sep 2024). It faces cyclical industry dynamics tied to offshore rig supply/demand and oil prices, but benefits from its scale and premium fleet positioning it for deepwater resurgence amid energy transition delays. Financially, it reported Q2 2024 revenue of $1,013 million (up 43% YoY from $706 million), adjusted EBITDA of $314 million (vs. $151 million), but a net loss of $128 million due to fleet stacking costs and impairments. Debt stands at ~$6.8 billion net, with liquidity ~$1.2 billion.

Sector dayrate uplift +5-10% supports share gains.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | RIG          | Valaris (VAL) | Noble (NE)   | Seadrill (SDRL) |\n|----------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Fleet Size (Rigorous)     | 37          | 36           | 29          | 17             |\n| Backlog ($B)              | 8.8         | 4.3          | 4.5         | 2.1            |\n| Utilization %             | 82 (Q2)     | 85           | 89          | 78             |\n| Avg Dayrate ($k)          | 430         | 410          | 450         | 380            |\n| Market Cap ($B)           | 3.62        | 5.2          | 4.8         | 2.9            |\n| Debt/EBITDA               | 7.5x        | 2.8x         | 1.5x        | 1.2x           |\n| **Edge**                  | Largest UDW fleet, backlog scale | Balanced fleet, low debt | High-spec efficiency | Shareholder returns |\n\n*RIG leads in scale/backlog but lags on leverage vs. peers.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: MPD tech collab with Weatherford (ongoing); digitalization with SLB (Q4 2023 pilot).\n- **M&A**: None in 2024; past divestitures (e.g., $1.1B jackup sale to Borr Drilling, 2023).

Moderate risk portfolio: Hold for 20-30% upside if Brent sustains $75+.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $6.50 (DCF-based: 8x 2025E EBITDA ~$1.2B, 10% rig market growth; aligns with Barclays/Scotiabank targets Oct 2024). Implies ~52% upside from $4.28. Strong growth requires GOM rebound and debt cut to <4x EBITDA.",

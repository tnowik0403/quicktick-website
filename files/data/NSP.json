Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Kingwood, Texas, the company serves over 100,000 businesses across the U.S., co-managing HR responsibilities for more than 325,000 worksite employees as of Q2 2024. Insperity's core offering, the Employer of Record (EOR) service, allows small- to mid-sized businesses (typically 5-500 employees) to outsource payroll, benefits administration, compliance, risk management, and HR consulting. This enables clients to access Fortune 500-level benefits (e.g., health insurance, 401(k) plans) at competitive rates through economies of scale.\n\nThe company generates revenue via administrative fees (paid monthly per worksite employee) and related services like insurance sales.

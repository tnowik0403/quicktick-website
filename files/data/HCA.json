Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**EHR Technology Modernization**: HCA Healthcare has completed the first large-scale wave of its MEDITECH Expanse EHR rollout, going live at 43 hospitals. The deployment represents the first large-scale wave of an enterprise-wide rollout for HCA Healthcare, one of the nation's largest providers, aimed at integrating data more seamlessly and accelerating the adoption of AI and digital innovations.\n\n**AI and Digital Transformation**: According to Jake O'Shea, HCA Healthcare's VP and CHIO, the system will help integrate data more seamlessly across the network, facilitating the adoption of future clinician-trusted AI solutions intended to return valuable time to the bedside. HCA Healthcare's move to Expanse is more than a simple technology replacement; it is a foundational step in the system's broader digital transformation strategy. Cloud-Based Foundation: The system is built on a modern, cloud-based architecture designed for high reliability and scale. Intuitive Mobile Interface: Expanse provides clinicians with personalized, mobile-friendly workflows that allow for more interaction at the bedside. Embedded Intelligence: The platform features embedded clinical decision support and AI capabilities intended to enhance safety, quality, and operational efficiency.\n\n**Operational Efficiency Initiatives**: Initiatives in operating efficiency, digital transformation, supply contract renewals, and technology deployment are advancing, targeting $600 million to $800 million in ongoing performance gains. AI and Digital Tools -- Ambient AI documentation pilots and revenue cycle automation are underway, focused on addressing payer denials and underpayments.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nLooking ahead, HCA is focusing on growing organically rather than making big acquisitions. They'll likely do some smaller deals here and there, but their main focus is on adding beds and building new facilities from the ground up. It's a strategy that combines strengthening their core hospital business while steadily expanding their outpatient presence.\n\n**Market Share Expansion**: HCA Healthcare is investing billions of dollars into expanding its emergency and high acuity service lines, targeting a 29% market share in healthcare services by the end of the decade, up from its current market share of 27%. Assuming equivalent admissions and associated revenue grows modestly following the investments, HCA executives are targeting a 4% to 6% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, also known as EBITDA, beginning in 2024.\n\n**Outpatient Expansion**: The operator also plans to expand outpatient locations. HCA hopes each inpatient hospital will have 20 outpatient locations in the next few years.\n\n**Capital Deployment**: Samuel Hazen, CEO, mentioned that the 2026 financial plan is not finalized, but it will likely follow past methodologies. The focus will remain on productive capital allocation to benefit networks, patients, and shareholders.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nHCA Healthcare serves a diverse patient population across its geographic markets with multiple payer sources:\n\n• **Commercial Insurance**: The largest revenue contributor with favorable payer mix trends\n• **Medicare**: Significant portion of patient volume, particularly given aging demographics\n• **Medicaid**: Enhanced by supplemental payment programs in various states\n• **Self-Pay/Uninsured**: Managed through financial counseling programs\n\n**Geographic Focus**: HCA Healthcare operates the largest hospital network in the United States, focusing on attractive geographic locations where it can lead and increase market share. With headquarters in Nashville, its facilities are concentrated in Texas and Florida, which represent over half of its bed count. In those states, the urban areas of focus include Dallas, Austin, Tampa, and Miami, and we believe these geographic areas provide a good sense of the positive demographic factors that the firm aims to benefit from nationwide.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results** (October 2025):\n• Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 totaled $19.161 billion, compared to $17.487 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $1.643 billion, or $6.96 per diluted share, compared to $1.270 billion, or $4.88 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024.\n• For the third quarter of 2025, Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.870 billion, compared to $3.267 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\n• HCA Healthcare generated $10.3 billion in cash from operations in the first nine months of 2025, which climbed 29.2% from the prior-year comparable period. HCA bought back shares worth $2.5 billion in the third quarter. It had a leftover capacity of $3.3 billion under its buyback authorization as of Sept. 30, 2025.\n\n**Updated 2025 Guidance**:\n• Annual revenues are presently anticipated to be between $75 billion and $76.5 billion, up from the prior guidance of $74-$76 billion. The midpoint of the revised outlook indicates a 7.3% rise from the 2024 figure.\n• Management forecasts adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $15.25-$15.65 billion, higher than the earlier view of $14.7-$15.3 billion.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n• **Demographic Trends**: HCA benefits when medical utilization rises, which may continue in the long run given favorable demographic trends.\n• **Market Share Gains**: Demand is running ahead of plan thanks to what HCA execs describe as broad-based market share gains and healthier macro fundamentals. Much of HCA's success in 2024 is spilling over into 2025, commensurate with general payor commentary around elevated utilization trends, coupled with HCA continuing to take market share from competitors.\n• **Strong Payer Mix**: HCA saw favorable payor mix trends, as is par for the course for the unicorn hospital operator. Same facility revenue increased almost 6.0% on a 3.0% rise in net revenue per equivalent admission – driven more by patient mix (e.g., a rise in critical care admissions) than pure price escalators.\n\n**Headwinds**:\n• **Healthcare Policy Uncertainty**: Sweeping changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are combining with rising health costs to make 2026 a high-stakes year for hospital operators. While major health systems like HCA are likely to weather the worst, some safety net providers and facilities on tight margins could close or scale back services as uncompensated care costs mount and uncertainty around future policies swirls.\n• Healthcare policy changes may pose a near-term headwind and persist as a long-term ESG risk until universal, affordable coverage is achieved in the US.\n• **Professional Fee Inflation**: A significant cost inflator, professional fee expense rose 11% year over year largely from physician subsidies tied to volume – costs were flat sequentially with the fourth quarter.\n• **Supply Chain Risks**: On the medical supplies side, HCA noted the Trump Admin tariffs could materially impact its supply chain and procurement. To that end the firm has been working to de-risk and diversify the supply chain within its GPO.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWith a market share of 40.37% in the healthcare industry and 42.01% in healthcare facilities, the company has outpaced competitors like Tenet Healthcare (11.49%) and Universal Health Services (9.14%) to solidify its leadership position.\n\nThe biggest company operating in the Hospitals industry in the United States is Hca Healthcare, Inc.

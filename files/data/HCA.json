(NYSE: HCA) is the largest for-profit acute care hospital operator in the United States, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in 1968, the company operates 186 hospitals, over 2,400 sites of care (including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics), and employs approximately 300,000 people across 20 states and one market in England (via 10 hospitals). HCA provides a full spectrum of healthcare services, including inpatient and outpatient acute care, cardiovascular services, oncology, orthopedics, neurosciences, women's health, emergency care, and population health management through its Sarah Cannon cancer network.\n\nThe company's business model emphasizes high-volume, high-acuity care in high-growth markets (e.g., Texas, Florida, Georgia), leveraging economies of scale, advanced clinical protocols, and technology investments to drive operational efficiency and superior clinical outcomes. HCA generates revenue primarily from Medicare (25-30%), Medicaid (10-15%), managed care (50-55%), and self-pay/other (5-10%). In 2023, it reported $65.0 billion in revenue, serving ~39 million patients annually. HCA's scale enables bargaining power with payers and suppliers, while its focus on de novo developments and acquisitions supports network expansion. The company has demonstrated resilience through economic cycles, pandemics, and labor shortages, consistently outperforming peers in volume growth and margins.

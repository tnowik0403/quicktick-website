The company offers flexible, self-paced degree programs ranging from associate to doctoral levels in fields such as business administration, information technology, engineering, psychology, and education. AIU emphasizes competency-based learning without traditional semester structures, targeting adult learners, working professionals, and international students seeking affordable alternatives to brick-and-mortar universities. Programs are delivered entirely online via proprietary platforms, with accreditation from the Accrediting Commission International (ACI), a non-recognized body by U.S. Department of Education—limiting degree recognition primarily to niche or international markets.\n\nATLN's business model relies on low-overhead digital delivery, charging tuition from $200–$1,000 per course or flat fees for degrees (e.g., $2,500–$10,000 total for bachelor's/doctoral programs). The company has historically served 1,000–5,000 active students annually, mostly from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, where U.S.-style credentials hold value despite accreditation issues. Revenue is generated through tuition, with minimal physical infrastructure costs. However, ATLN operates as a microcap OTC Pink stock with extreme volatility, low liquidity (average daily volume <100K shares), and a history of reverse splits (e.g., 1:100 in 2023). As of October 10, 2024, the stock trades at $0.0002 per share, with a market capitalization of approximately $187,000 (fully diluted ~935M shares outstanding), per OTC Markets and Yahoo Finance data. The company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny and dilution risks from frequent share issuances. (248 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 2024**: Sparse activity; no major announcements. StockTwits and Reddit (r/pennystocks, r/ATLN) discussions dominated by pump signals and spam (e.g., Oct 8 post claiming \"breakout imminent\" with 50+ likes, but no substance).\n- **September 12, 2024**: Filed 10-Q with OTC Markets showing Q2 2024 revenue of $45,200 (down 15% YoY), net loss $112,400; no gross margin disclosed (source: OTC Disclosure).\n- **July 15, 2024**: Reverse stock split (1:500) approved to regain compliance, per company PR—stock price briefly spiked to $0.01 before declining.\n- **June 2024**: Investorboards.net threads highlight \"dead money\" sentiment; no earnings call transcripts available (company does not host calls).\n- **April 2024**: Launched minor website updates for AIU, promoting \"AI-enhanced learning tools\" (unverified impact).\n\n*Note: No earnings data <6 months old beyond Q2 10-Q; prior filings (e.g., Q1 2024 revenue $52,000) excluded.*\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, close)**:\n| Metric          | Value          | Source       |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Price           | $0.0002       | Yahoo Finance |\n| Market Cap      | $187,000      | OTC Markets |\n| 52-Week Range   | $0.0001–$0.02 | Yahoo Finance |\n| Avg.

Avoid for moderate risk portfolios.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $0.0001**  \n(Discounted cash flow negligible; liquidation value ~cash/assets per Q2 filings. Upside limited to pump volatility; 50% downside probable.)",

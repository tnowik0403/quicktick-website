Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Irvine, California, Masimo pioneered rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry technology, which measures multiple blood constituents noninvasively, including oxygen saturation (SpO2), total hemoglobin (SpHb®), and carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®). The company's core platform includes hospital-grade devices like the Root® and Radical-7® monitors, integrated with over 100 sensors and parameters for continuous monitoring of vital signs, brain function (SedLine® Brain Function Monitoring), and regional oximetry (OTx®). Masimo also operates in consumer health via its Masimo Consumer division (formerly Sound United, acquired in 2022), offering wearable devices like the Freedom® band and Stork™ smart baby monitor, which leverage Masimo's biosensor tech for SpO2 and pulse rate tracking.\n\nBeyond healthcare, Masimo's technology powers automotive (e.g., drowsiness detection in vehicles) and aviation applications. With ~4,300 employees, Masimo reported fiscal 2023 revenue of $1.52 billion, serving over 100 countries. The company emphasizes signal extraction technology (SET®) for accuracy in motion and low perfusion, holding a strong IP portfolio with 1,200+ patents. Recent expansion into consumer and hearing health (via Sound United brands like Bose) diversifies revenue, while ongoing litigation with Apple underscores its dominance in pulse oximetry IP. Masimo's mission focuses on improving patient outcomes and safety, with products in 9 of 10 top U.S. hospitals.

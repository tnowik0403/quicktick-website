(NASDAQ: OFLX) is a specialty manufacturer focused on designing, engineering, and producing flexible metal hose and braided assemblies for critical fluid and gas handling applications. Founded in 1975 and headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, the company serves diverse markets including residential and commercial construction (e.g., natural gas piping, fire protection sprinklers, and potable water systems), industrial manufacturing (e.g., petrochemical, aerospace, and semiconductor), and OEM applications. Its flagship brands include TracPipe® (corrugated stainless steel tubing for gas distribution), CounterStrike® (flexible gas connectors resistant to lightning strikes and corrosion), and Titeflex® (high-pressure braided hoses). Omega Flex emphasizes proprietary innovations in material science, such as polymer-lined hoses for enhanced durability and safety compliance. With a lean manufacturing model, vertically integrated production in North America, and a focus on code-compliant products, the company generates ~80% of revenue from U.S. construction markets. It operates with high gross margins (typically 50%+) due to premium pricing and low-cost production.

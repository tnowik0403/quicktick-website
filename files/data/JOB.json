(NASDAQ: JOB) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- Stock Price: $30.92\n- Market Capitalization: $1.15 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $11.17 - $45.58\n- Trailing P/E: 6.84\n- Forward P/E: 5.62\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nGigaCloud Technology Inc. (JOB) is a pioneering B2B e-commerce platform specializing in large parcel merchandise, primarily connecting Asian manufacturers (mainly in China) with small-to-medium (SMB) retailers and distributors in the United States and Europe. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Irvine, California, the company went public on NASDAQ in August 2022. Its end-to-end platform facilitates transactions for bulky, high-SKU items like furniture, home appliances, fitness equipment, and outdoor products, handling everything from product sourcing and listing to payments, global logistics (warehousing in U.S./Europe/Asia), and fulfillment. \n\nUnlike traditional B2B models reliant on trade shows or brokers, GigaCloud's marketplace uses proprietary technology for real-time inventory visibility, AI-driven matching, and drop-shipping to reduce costs and lead times. In Q2 2024, marketplace GMV hit $1.13 billion (up 90.4% YoY), with active third-party sellers growing 39.1% to 1,111 and active buyers up 85.9% to 9,444. The company operates 10 U.S. warehouses (totaling ~3M sq ft) and has expanded into Europe (e.g., Germany, UK). Revenue model: ~84% from product sales, 16% from services. JOB targets the fragmented $200B+ global B2B large-parcel market, disrupting incumbents by digitizing supply chains amid e-commerce penetration (still <10% for bulky goods).

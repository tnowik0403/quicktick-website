(VNOM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, market close via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $41.79\n- **Market Capitalization**: $8.23 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $33.42 - $49.03\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.32 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nViper Energy, Inc. (NYSE: VNOM), formerly Viper Energy Partners LP, is a leading independent owner and acquirer of mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties, with a primary focus on the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. The company generates revenue through royalty payments from operators drilling and producing on its acreage, without bearing operational costs, capital expenditures, or environmental liabilities. As of Q2 2024, Viper holds approximately 84,000 gross royalty acres across key Permian sub-basins including the Midland, Central Basin Platform, Delaware Basin, and Northwest Shelf.\n\nViper's business model emphasizes low-risk, high-margin cash flows from long-life reserves, with production diversified across top-tier operators. It benefits from its affiliation with Diamondback Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: FANG), which owns ~58% of Viper post its C-Corp conversion in October 2023. This structure allows Viper to pursue accretive acquisitions funded by equity issuances to Diamondback and external capital. In 2024 YTD, Viper has aggressively expanded via M&A, adding over 20,000 royalty acres and boosting production guidance. The company pays a base quarterly dividend plus variable supplements tied to cash flows, yielding ~6.5% annualized as of Q2 2024. Viper's strategy positions it for mid-teens production growth amid Permian consolidation, with minimal debt (net debt ~$300M) and strong distributable cash flow (DCF) coverage.

Since 2019, it has acquired 11 companies representing $1.6 billion in annualized sales. The company has successfully acquired 69 HVAC distribution businesses without external financial assistance and over the last five years, Watsco has acquired eight businesses that today generate approximately $1 billion in annual sales.

Earnings were $498.89 million, a decrease of -0.10%.\n\nWatsco fell short of the markets revenue expectations in Q3 CY2025, with sales falling 4.3% year on year to $2.07 billion. Its GAAP profit of $3.98 per share was 7.3% below analysts' consensus estimates.\n\nGross profit margin expanded 130 basis-points to a third-quarter record of 27.5%, driven by further scaling of Watsco's pricing technologies, as well as OEM pricing actions implemented earlier in 2025.\n\nThe Company maintains a solid financial position with currently more than $640 million in cash and investments and no debt, enabling sustained investments in growth, particularly the Company's industry-leading technology platforms.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n- The transition, which began in September 2024 and will conclude in early 2026, has created volatility in sales, industry shipments, distributor inventories and further compounded by overall weaker consumer spending and slower housing-related activities.\n- Management noted \"mid-single-digit\" revenue declines so far in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- Management anticipates the market will stabilize in 2026 as the disruptive effects of the A2L refrigerant change fade. They expect a simpler operational environment, which could unlock efficiencies and support a return to more typical demand patterns.\n- Price realization for the new A2L products has averaged approximately 15% inclusive of mid-year OEM price actions.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe above exhibit shows Watsco's market share at 18%-20%, though in other contexts management has pegged it at ~12%. In either case, Watsco is significantly larger than the next two largest distributors, Lennox (who is also an OEM) and Ferguson, who each do ~$3bn of HVAC revenue.\n\nAccording to ACHR News, Ferguson is the second-largest HVAC distributor after Watsco (NYSE:WSO). Ferguson has a 5% market share of a $70 billion market.\n\nTheir largest market share is in the Heating & Air-Conditioning Equipment Wholesaling industry, where they account for an estimated 6.7% of total industry revenue and are considered an All Star because they display stronger market share.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nWatsco is a prominent competitor, particularly in the HVAC and refrigeration market. It is recognized as the largest distributor in its sector across North America, carrying major brands.\n\nThe top 30 HVAC distributors 2023 sales total was $19.8 billion USD. Watsco, along with Ferguson Enterprises, Winsupply Inc., and R.E. Michel Co., reported combined 2023 sales of more than $14.48 billion USD. Watsco is the largest with total 2023 revenue of $7.28 billion.\n\nHowever, Watsco does not operate in isolation; it faces stiff competition from companies like Ferguson Plc, Carrier Global, and Daikin Industries, each vying for market share in the HVAC industry.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn May 2025, Watsco completed the acquisition of Southern Ice Equipment Distributors, alongside two other transactions earlier in the year. In January, Watsco acquired Lashley & Associates, a U.S. based distributor specializing in custom air movement products and commercial supplies. This was followed by the acquisition of Hawkins HVAC Distributors in April 2025, a supplier of HVAC supplies and equipment with locations in North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n\nWatsco has never participated in an auction or hired a banker for any of its deals, preferring to instead maintain ties with local distributors, fostering goodwill and trust so that when those operators finally decide to sell, they find in Watsco a permanent home where what they've built over so many years will be preserved intact.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n- **A2L Refrigerant Transition**: 2025 results reflect a significant regulatory transition to new HVAC systems that incorporates A2L refrigerants. The regulatory mandate impacted nearly 55% of all products and required the conversion of over $1 billion of inventory across more than 650 U.S. locations.\n\n- **Technology Investments**: The Company has invested more than $250 million in technology over the last five years (an annual current run rate of $60 million) and employs close to 300 technologists.\n\n- **Digital Platform Growth**: Ecommerce has become a key driver of Watsco's growth, with its digital sales reaching $2.6 billion in 2024, accounting for 35% of total revenue.\n\n- **Dividend Increase**: In April 2025, the Company raised its annual dividend by 11% to $12.00 per share, marking its 51st consecutive year of dividends.\n\n## 13.

Limited growth upside (projected 3-5% EPS CAGR 2025-27) amid regional bank headwinds; attractive yield but vulnerable to further CRE provisions or delayed rate relief. Fair value for strong growth/moderate risk portfolio: $8.50 (18% upside from $7.19; based on 10x 2025E EPS $0.85, 0.85x TBV $10.00, peer avg multiples adjusted for size).

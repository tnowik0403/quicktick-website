Smucker Company (SJM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Date of Report:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $116.37 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $12.99 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $105.69 - $127.89  \n\n## Company Overview\nThe J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), founded in 1897 and headquartered in Orrville, Ohio, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded food and beverage products, pet food, and pet snacks in North America. The company operates across three core segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and U.S. Retail Pet Food, with a newer Sweet Baked Goods segment added via the Hostess acquisition. Iconic brands include Folgers and Dunkin' coffee (licensed), Jif peanut butter, Smucker's fruit spreads, Meow Mix and Milk-Bone pet foods, and Hostess Twinkies, CupCakes, and Ding Dongs. SJM generates nearly all revenue in the U.S., focusing on grocery, mass merchandiser, club, and foodservice channels. With ~8,600 employees, it emphasizes portfolio optimization through acquisitions, cost discipline, and innovation in high-margin categories. FY2024 net sales were $8.49 billion, driven by pet food (27% of sales) and coffee (32%), though facing volume pressures amid inflation. Recent Hostess integration bolsters snacking exposure, targeting $1 billion+ in annual sales from sweets. SJM is a Dividend Aristocrat (62 years of increases), appealing to income investors, but growth hinges on pet recovery and Hostess synergies amid mature categories.

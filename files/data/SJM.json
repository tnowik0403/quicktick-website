Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Uncrustables Expansion:**\n- We have grown Uncrustables from a $12 million brand to one delivering approximately $800 million in annual net sales last fiscal year. With the new facility now open, we are well positioned to realize our goal of $1 billion in annual net sales by the end of fiscal year 2026.\n- The J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE: SJM) celebrated the opening of its new 900,000-square-foot Uncrustables® manufacturing facility in McCalla, Alabama.

Growth Strategy\n\n**Portfolio Optimization:**\n- Portfolio optimization through divestitures of underperforming brands, including the Voortman business and certain Sweet Baked Snacks value brands\n- This divestiture reflects our continued commitment to portfolio optimization to prioritize resources to support the execution of our Sweet Baked Snacks strategy, focused on growing the Hostess brand, and advancing our leadership in the sweet baked goods category\n\n**Long-term Financial Algorithm:**\n- The company emphasized its commitment to delivering its long-term financial algorithm, including a goal of over $1 billion in annual free cash flow.\n- Low single-digit net sales growth. Mid-single-digit operating income growth. High single-digit adjusted EPS growth.

As you think about the leverage profile this year, we'll probably hover around four times through the balance of fiscal year 2026. Then as we step into '27, we should begin to see the step down toward that three times amount in fiscal year 2027.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Key Retail Partners:**\n- Nearly 33 percent of Smucker's sales could be attributed to Walmart.\n- The company sells its products through direct sales and brokers to food retailers, club stores, discount and dollar stores, online retailers, pet specialty stores, distributors, drug stores, military commissaries, mass merchandisers, supermarket chains, national mass retailers, convenience stores, vending channels, and foodservice distributors and operators.\n\n**Away-From-Home Expansion:**\n- Historically, net sales for the Uncrustables brand have been split approximately 80% US retail, 20% away from home. But with increased supply, we anticipate that split could shift favorably to the away-from-home business. This demonstrates just how much opportunity we have yet to unlock in away-from-home channels.\n- Additional growth will come through growth in K-12 schools\n\n## 7.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Current Market Challenges:**\nThe company faces significant headwinds from coffee tariffs ($75 million impact), struggling Sweet Baked Snacks segment (20% volume decline), and substantial impairment charges related to the Hostess acquisition totaling over $1.6 billion. The trailing twelve-month net loss of $1.2 billion and negative P/E ratio of -9.19 reflect ongoing operational challenges.\n\n**Investment Positives:**\nStrong market leadership positions in coffee (Folgers, Café Bustelo) and peanut butter (46.3% market share with Jif), robust dividend history (24 consecutive years of increases), and the promising Uncrustables growth story targeting $1 billion in sales by fiscal 2026. The company maintains strong free cash flow generation capabilities and has a clear debt reduction strategy.\n\n**Growth Potential:**\nThe 12-month stock price target is $115.08, which is an increase of 14.42% from the latest price. The Uncrustables brand represents significant growth potential, with massive capacity expansion and distribution opportunities in convenience stores and away-from-home channels.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe Hostess acquisition has proven challenging, with multiple impairment charges and declining segment performance. Legal investigations and analyst downgrades indicate investor concern about management's M&A execution capabilities.\n\n**Investment Rating: 6.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:** While SJM maintains strong market-leading positions in core categories and offers attractive dividend yield, the company faces significant near-term challenges from the underperforming Hostess integration, coffee cost inflation, and margin pressures. The growth potential of Uncrustables and strong brand portfolio provide upside, but execution risks and competitive pressures limit the investment appeal for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $110**\n\nThis valuation reflects the company's strong market positions and cash generation capabilities while accounting for integration challenges and current margin pressures. The fair value represents modest upside from current levels, consistent with a hold recommendation for conservative investors seeking dividend income.",

(TTWO) is a premier global developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment, primarily video games for consoles, PC, and mobile devices. Operating through two flagship labels—Rockstar Games and 2K—the company dominates premium gaming with blockbuster franchises. Rockstar Games produces mature, narrative-driven titles like the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series, Red Dead Redemption (RDR), and Max Payne, emphasizing open-world experiences with massive live-service ecosystems (e.g., GTA Online). 2K focuses on sports, strategy, and RPGs, including NBA 2K, WWE 2K, PGA TOUR 2K, Civilization (Firaxis Games), Borderlands (Gearbox), and indie titles via Private Division. TTWO generates ~70% of revenue from recurring live services and microtransactions, bolstered by a $12.7 billion acquisition of Zynga in May 2022 for mobile/social expansion. With 13 studios worldwide, TTWO targets high-margin, IP-driven content. In FY2025 (ended March 31, 2025), it shipped over 100 million units lifetime for core titles.

(SEI) is a leading provider of specialized mobile equipment and services for proppant (primarily sand) storage, handling, and logistics at hydraulic fracturing (frac) sites, with a focus on the Permian Basin. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, SEI operates through its proprietary MobilePro® platform, which deploys containerized sand delivery systems that reduce truck traffic, emissions, and costs compared to traditional methods. The company also offers well site fluid management via its StackFracs and related services. Targeting exploration and production (E&P) operators, SEI benefits from the Permian’s scale, handling ~10-15% of regional sand volumes via its fleet of ~100 MobilePro units (as of Q2 2024). With ~$300M revenue run-rate and a pivot toward technology-enabled logistics (e.g., real-time telemetry), SEI positions itself as a cost-efficient disruptor in the $5-7B annual U.S. proppant logistics market. Post-SPAC merger in 2018, SEI has expanded amid Permian rig count growth but faces cyclical oilfield pressures.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 31, 2024):** Revenue $94.0M (↑38% YoY from $68.3M); Net income $10.4M (vs. $4.7M loss YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $23.4M (↑67% YoY, 24.9% margin); EPS $0.23 (verified via SEC 10-Q, August 2024 filing).\n- **Fleet Expansion:** Added 12 MobilePro units in Q2 2024; total active fleet ~100 units (85% utilization).\n- **Debt Reduction:** Repaid $15M term loan in July 2024; net debt ~$50M (leverage 1.2x EBITDA).\n- **September 10, 2024:** Announced partnership extension with major Permian E&P for Last Mile sand delivery.\n- **October 2, 2024:** Participated in Piper Sandler Energy Conference; mgmt. reiterated 2024 revenue guidance $340-360M (unchanged).\n- **Insider Buying:** CEO Nicholas Kovacs purchased 20,000 shares on August 15, 2024, at $8.95/share (SEC Form 4).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Organic Fleet Growth:** Target 10-15% annual fleet additions (2025 goal: 110-120 units), funded by cash flow (~$60-70M FCF est. 2024).\n- **Technology Integration:** Rollout of TeleStacker telemetry for real-time sand inventory tracking (piloted Q3 2024; full deployment Q1 2025).\n- **Service Diversification:** Expand Last Mile Logistics (sand from mine to site) to 30% of revenue (from 20% in Q2 2024); enter produced water recycling pilots.\n- **Geographic Expansion:** Limited push into Eagle Ford/DJ Basin (5-10% revenue by 2026); 90%+ Permian focus.\n- **M&A Pipeline:** Opportunistic tuck-ins for fluid handling assets (mgmt. commented Q2 call).\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High capex (~$40M 2024) amid softening Permian frac activity (rig count ↓5% YoY per Baker Hughes Oct 2024); customer concentration (top 3 clients ~60% revenue). | Strong balance sheet (cash $25M Q2); high utilization (85%); cost savings from tech (5-10% per job). |\n| **Sector (Permian Proppant Logistics)** | Oil prices volatility (WTI ~$70/bbl Oct 2024); frac crew efficiency gains reducing sand demand/job (down 10-15% since 2022); supply chain sand oversupply. | Permian dominance (60% U.S. oil); rising lateral lengths boosting sand/frac (1.5-2M lbs/well); ESG push for low-emission logistics. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **MobilePro®:** Containerized sand silos/conveyors (core; 70% revenue).\n- **Telemetry & Controls:** Real-time monitoring (15% revenue).\n- **Last Mile Logistics:** Rail-to-wellhead sand transport (15% revenue).\n- **StackFracs & Fluid Management:** Temporary water storage (emerging; 5% revenue).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **TeleStacker™ (Q4 2024 rollout):** AI-driven inventory mgmt.; expected 20% utilization uplift.\n- **Water-On-Demand (pilot Q3 2024):** Modular produced water handling; potential $20M revenue by 2026.\n- **Hybrid Electric Units:** 10 units in development for 2025 (ESG compliance with clients like Occidental).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Market Share:** ~8-12% of Permian proppant logistics (~$2B submarket; est. via mgmt.

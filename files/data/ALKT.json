(ALKT) is a leading cloud-based digital banking solutions provider headquartered in Plano, Texas, founded in 2009 and public since April 2021. The company delivers a comprehensive, mobile-first digital banking platform tailored primarily for U.S. banks and credit unions, particularly community financial institutions (FIs) with $100M-$50B in assets. Its end-to-end platform includes account opening, payments, lending, wealth management, and personalization tools, powered by AI-driven insights to enhance user engagement and retention.\n\nALKT's technology stack enables FIs to compete with larger banks and fintechs like Chime or SoFi by offering seamless omnichannel experiences (mobile app, web, voice). As of Q2 2024, it serves over 230 FIs with 20.1 million registered users, representing ~24% YoY growth. Revenue is primarily subscription-based (recurring ARR model), with ~95% from top 20 clients stable. The platform processes billions in transactions annually, focusing on embedded finance and open banking trends. ALKT differentiates via API extensibility, no-code customization, and data analytics for hyper-personalization.\n\nIn a fragmented $10B+ U.S. digital banking software market dominated by legacy vendors, ALKT captures modern share through agile cloud-native architecture, avoiding on-premise pitfalls. Challenges include profitability amid R&D investments, but path to EBITDA positivity is clear. With digital adoption accelerating post-COVID (80%+ U.S. consumers bank digitally), ALKT is positioned for sustained 25%+ growth.

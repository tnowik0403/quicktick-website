(URI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** December 6, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $787.69 (as of market close December 6, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $52.85 billion (as of December 6, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $458.41 - $839.94  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ, Seeking Alpha, company IR site, Earnings call transcripts (Q3 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha), Bloomberg, Reuters articles (Oct-Nov 2024), Barron's, CNBC discussions.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nUnited Rentals, Inc. (URI) is the world's largest equipment rental company, providing a comprehensive fleet of rental equipment to the construction, industrial, and utility sectors primarily in North America, with expanding presence in Europe and the UK. Founded in 1997 and headquartered in Stamford, CT, URI operates over 1,500 locations across the U.S. and Canada, serving customers ranging from small contractors to Fortune 500 firms. Its core offerings include general rental equipment (e.g., aerial work platforms, earthmoving machinery, skid steers), specialty rentals (trench safety, power generation, HVAC), and trench safety systems. URI's business model emphasizes high fleet utilization (currently ~68% in Q3 2024), right-sizing inventory, and superior customer service via its \"total access to total solutions\" strategy.\n\nThe company benefits from secular tailwinds like U.S. infrastructure spending (IIJA/IRA acts), data center boom, and manufacturing reshoring. In Q3 2024 (ended September 30), URI reported record revenue of $4.47 billion (+14.4% YoY), adjusted EBITDA of $2.07 billion (+15.4% YoY), and adjusted EPS of $10.91 (+7.4% YoY), driven by 7.7% organic growth and acquisition contributions. With a fleet value exceeding $20 billion, URI maintains pricing discipline (+3.1% in Q3) and targets market share gains in a fragmented industry. Risks include cyclical construction exposure, but diversification into non-residential end-markets (90%+ of revenue) and strong balance sheet (net leverage 1.8x) position it for sustained growth.

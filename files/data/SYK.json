Existing Products/Services\n\nStryker's existing product portfolio spans multiple therapeutic areas:\n\n**MedSurg and Neurotechnology (60% of revenues):**\n- Surgical equipment and navigation systems\n- Endoscopic and communications systems\n- Patient handling and emergency medical equipment\n- Neurovascular devices for stroke treatment\n- Medical devices and equipment\n- SAGE infection prevention products\n\n**Orthopaedics (40% of revenues):**\n- Joint replacement implants (hip, knee, shoulder)\n- Trauma and extremities products\n- Sports medicine solutions\n- Foot and ankle devices\n- With over 1.5 million Mako procedures performed globally across 45 countries, Mako is a market-leading technology in orthopaedics. In late 2013, Stryker had the first mover advantage when it acquired MAKO Surgical and has more than 2,000 systems installed worldwide at year-end 2024. Stryker's MAKO system is approved for total knee, partial knee and total hip applications.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Mako Robotic Platform Expansion:**\nAdditionally, now commercially available is Stryker's fourth generation Mako System, Mako 4, a single robotics system that delivers additional applications and innovation, designed to offer a premium clinical and operational experience compared to manual across Mako Total Hip, Total Knee, Partial Knee and Spine. Mako Spine and Mako Shoulder are the latest to join the SmartRobotics™ suite of applications. Stryker completed its first Mako Spine cases in October and continues its limited market release with full U.S. commercial launch expected in the second half of 2025. Stryker also completed Mako Shoulder's first cases at the end of last year, and the application remains in limited market release through 2025.\n\n**Advanced Hip Revision Capability:**\nWith the introduction of Mako Total Hip with Advanced Primary and Revision, Stryker expands on its established Mako Total Hip offering to include a first-to-market robotic hip revision capability. In revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), the expanded Mako Total Hip application is engineered to streamline workflow and enable confidence in challenging procedures with new features such as augment and screw planning, intraoperative screw trajectory guidance and compatibility with Stryker's revision hip implant portfolio.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe core economic engine of Stryker is built on volume and innovation, not aggressive price hikes. So, the company focuses on selling more units, especially high-value capital equipment like the Mako robotic-arm assisted surgery system, which drives recurring revenue. In Q3 2025, the organic sales growth of 9.5% was almost entirely driven by unit volume growth of 9.1%, with pricing only contributing a modest 0.4%. That's a classic volume-over-price strategy.\n\n**M&A Strategy:**\nLobo said, adding most of the acquisitions are not very large, and the company tends to buy fast-growing assets. Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo highlighted the company's recent acquisitions in October 2024, stating that he expects the acquisitions to contribute $300 million to its 2025 sales.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nWe serve healthcare customers including hospital administrators, surgeons and healthcare professionals in all healthcare environments, from large, integrated hospital systems to small, outpatient surgery centers.\n\n**Confirmed Hospital Customers (from search results):**\n- UCSF at Mount Zion\n- University of Michigan Health System\n- PeaceHealth St. John Medical Center\n- Ketchikan Medical Center\n- Ochsner Health System\n- LHP Hospital Group\n- The Great Falls Hospital\n\nStryker Corp. announced that more than 550 hospitals nationwide are using the SurgiCount Safety-Sponge System and have accounted for nearly 200 million surgical sponges around the United States in the past five years.\n\n## 7.

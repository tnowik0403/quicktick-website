Founded in 1999 and going public in 2018, MCB focuses on serving small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), freelancers, and select individuals primarily in the New York metropolitan area. The Bank specializes in commercial real estate (CRE) loans, multifamily lending, commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, and deposit products tailored to fintech and digital economy clients. It differentiates via a tech-enabled platform supporting high-yield deposits from fintech partners (e.g., crypto exchanges, payment processors) and niche lending like equipment finance and factoring.\n\nWith ~$8.5B in assets (Q2 2024), MCB operates 8 branches in NYC and emphasizes relationship banking with digital capabilities.

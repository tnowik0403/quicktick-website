The company operates a vast network of over 2,200 patient service centers, 47 labs, and processes ~25 million tests monthly, serving physicians, hospitals, consumers, and biopharma clients. Core segments include Diagnostic Information Services (DIS, ~95% of revenue: routine clinicals like bloodwork, anatomic pathology, genetics, and advanced diagnostics like NGS-based cancer tests) and Neuroscience (e.g., neuroimmunology assays).  \n\nFounded in 1967 as part of Corning and spun off in 1996, Quest emphasizes precision medicine, leveraging AI/ML for test accuracy and expanding into consumer-initiated testing via QuestHealth.com. In 2023, it generated $9.25B in revenue, with a focus on high-margin esoteric testing (e.g., cardiometabolic, oncology). The company benefits from the $100B+ U.S. diagnostics market, driven by aging demographics (65+ population growing 3% annually) and chronic disease prevalence (e.g., 60% of adults with cardiometabolic risks). Challenges include reimbursement pressures, but Quest's scale, 20%+ adjusted EBITDA margins, and $1B+ free cash flow support dividends (52-year streak) and buybacks ($1B authorized in 2024). Strategically, it's pivoting to growth areas like liquid biopsy and companion diagnostics amid post-COVID volume normalization.

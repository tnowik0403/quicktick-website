Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe strategic focus on U.S. market expansion is particularly noteworthy. By introducing MotoGP races in Las Vegas and Miami—cities where Formula One has already achieved commercial success—Liberty aims to tap into underpenetrated audiences and replicate the \"event-driven\" revenue model that has boosted F1's profitability.\n\n- Liberty Media plans to expand F1 racing in China and India, thus expanding global reach.\n- The arrival of Audi and Cadillac to the red-hot circuit next year will create a new wave of partnership opportunities for a sport that's already a global sponsorship powerhouse. Cadillac entreé into F1 in 2026 marks a major milestone for US involvement in the sport. Backed by General Motors and TWG Motorsports, the storied American carmaker's upcoming debut as the 11th team on the grid is set to infuse fresh energy into F1 and attract new fans stateside.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nIncreasing the number of races from 16 to 22 per season; further expansion into new markets in Asia and the Americas, to truly globalise the sport\n\nTo grow the game's popularity, Liberty Media focused on expanding to new markets, digital transformation, and a revised content and entertainment strategy. Their strategy included the introduction of new race circuits in the US, the Miami and Las Vegas Grands Prix.\n\nThe Grand Prix schedule in 2025 once again includes three US races in Austin, Las Vegas and Miami. Formula One Group's (F1) US profile has been transformed under Liberty Media, which will try to monetize this popularity when renewing its current US media rights agreement that expires at the end of the forthcoming season.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Global Partners:**\n- Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) has agreed a historic 10-year, billion-dollar Formula 1 deal from 2025. The agreement covers several of the group's luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, and Moët Hennessy.\n- In 2025, PepsiCo expanded its global reach through a landmark partnership with Formula 1. This partnership unites the world's greatest sports and entertainment spectacle with three of PepsiCo's powerhouse brands: Sting Energy, Gatorade, and Doritos.\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Global Partner since 2018\n- Santander is building a more responsible bank and has made a number of commitments to support this objective, including raising over €120 billion in green financing between 2019 and 2025\n- Crypto.com is a global partner of Formula 1 with an agreement that runs through 2030.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nFormula One Group had revenue of $1.09B in the quarter ending September 30, 2025, with 19.10% growth. This brings the company's revenue in the last twelve months to $4.04B, up 8.72% year-over-year.\n\nThe company has $1.29 billion in cash and $5.16 billion in debt, giving a net cash position of -$3.87 billion or -$15.49 per share. In the last 12 months, operating cash flow was $793.00 million and capital expenditures -$81.00 million, giving a free cash flow of $712.00 million.\n\nGross margin is 32.90%, with operating and profit margins of 12.48% and 5.50%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Expanding global audience and digital engagement, combined with new experiential offerings, are driving stronger sponsorship, ticketing, and media revenue opportunities\n- Part of the rising F1's popularity can be attributed to growth in North America due to the acquisition of Formula One Group by US-based Liberty Media in 2016, and Netflix documentaries. In 2025, five of the 24 rounds are scheduled to be held in North America. In addition, the total revenue of F1 in 2023 reached 3.2 billion dollars, an increase of 25% from the previous year, growing into a huge sports business.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Heightened global regulations, eco-consciousness, and demographic shifts threaten revenue from sponsorships, hosting fees, and fan engagement, impacting long-term growth. Rising technology costs and unstable media revenues challenge profitability, while expanding in emerging markets faces greater public and fiscal resistance.\n- With these rights set to expire at the end of 2025, however, it was initially reported that the network had chosen to withdraw from future negotiations. Comments during Liberty Media's Feb. 27 earnings call do not rule out ESPN's future involvement, but it appears that they may not be willing to bid aggressively for renewed terms.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nF1 is the premier global motorsport with exclusive commercial rights to the FIA Formula One World Championship. Formula 1 racing is a global sport with a large and growing fan base. The sport is also very popular in emerging markets, such as China and India, where there is a growing middle class with disposable income.\n\nThe global Formula 1 racing market was valued at USD 2.45 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach approximately USD 3.61 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of Formula 1 racing in emerging markets, the growing investment in Formula 1 racing by sponsors and teams, and the increasing use of technology in Formula 1 racing.\n\n## 10.

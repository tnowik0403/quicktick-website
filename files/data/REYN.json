(REYN) is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of everyday consumer products focused on convenience in the kitchen and waste management categories. Headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, the company operates through two main segments: Reynolds (aluminum foil, baking cups, oven bags, and disposable aluminum pans under the Reynolds Wrap® and Reynolds® brands) and Hefty (trash bags, storage bags, disposable plates, cups, and utensils under the Hefty® brand). REYN holds dominant positions in premium foil (leading U.S. market share) and strong footholds in trash bags and tableware.\n\nFounded as part of the Rank Group (spun off in 2019 via IPO), REYN benefits from a portfolio of iconic brands with high household penetration (Reynolds in ~80% of U.S. households, per company filings). Products are sold through major retailers like Walmart, Kroger, Target, and Amazon, generating ~95% of revenue from the U.S. market. In FY2023, the company reported $4.78 billion in net sales (verified from 2023 10-K). REYN emphasizes innovation in sustainable packaging, cost efficiencies via resin/aluminum hedging, and brand marketing to drive premium pricing. With a debt-light balance sheet (net leverage ~1.5x EBITDA) and consistent free cash flow (~$400M annually), it returns capital via dividends (including special dividends totaling $1.3B since 2020). Facing headwinds from commodity volatility and plastic regulations, REYN's strategy centers on e-commerce growth, category expansion, and operational resilience in a $20B+ U.S. disposables market.

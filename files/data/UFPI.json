(UFPI) is a diversified manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of wood, composite, and plastic products, primarily serving the retail, packaging, and construction sectors across North America and select international markets. Founded in 1955 and headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the company operates through three key segments: UFP Retail Solutions (outdoor living products like decks, fencing, and railing sold to big-box retailers), UFP Packaging (customized wood and plastic containers/pallets for industrial, consumer goods, and food/beverage clients), and UFP Construction (engineered wood components such as roof/floor trusses, wall panels, and lumber for residential/commercial builders). With approximately 10,000 employees and 300+ locations, UFPI emphasizes value-added manufacturing, supply chain efficiency, and sustainability (e.g., FSC-certified wood sourcing). The company has evolved from a lumber distributor to a vertically integrated player, leveraging scale to navigate commodity cycles. In 2023, it generated $7.2B in revenue, benefiting from housing recovery post-2020 but facing headwinds from 2024 slowdowns. UFPI's strategy focuses on market share gains via acquisitions, product innovation, and diversification beyond cyclical construction (which is ~40% of sales).

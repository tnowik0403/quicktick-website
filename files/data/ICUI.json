(NASDAQ: ICUI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $114.24  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.31 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $102.84 - $161.99  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (due to recent losses)  \n- **Dividend Yield**: None  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nICU Medical, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer of innovative medical devices used in infusion therapy, critical care, and oncology. Headquartered in San Clemente, California, the company provides a comprehensive portfolio of single-use products, including IV smart pumps (e.g., Plum 360, Symbigra), IV therapy sets, needlefree connectors (e.g., MicroClave, SwabCap), catheters, and automated compounding systems (e.g., Diana). Its solutions focus on enhancing patient safety, reducing healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs), and improving clinician efficiency in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and oncology clinics.  \n\nThe company expanded significantly through its $2.9 billion acquisition of Smiths Medical in October 2022 (completed January 2023), nearly doubling revenue and adding high-margin products like the CADD infusion pumps and Portex tracheostomy devices. ICUI operates in over 80 countries, with ~90% of revenue from the U.S. It emphasizes clinically proven safety technologies, such as neutral fluid displacement connectors and chemoGuard closed-system transfer devices. Amid post-acquisition integration, ICUI faces margin pressures but targets mid-single-digit organic growth through portfolio optimization and innovation in smart connectivity and automation.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Total revenue $588.9 million (up 6% YoY); adjusted EBITDA $84.3 million (14.3% margin).

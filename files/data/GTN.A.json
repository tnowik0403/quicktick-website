EBITDA Margin | 17% | 22% | 28% | 18% |\n| Net Debt/EBITDA | 4.3x | 3.2x | 2.5x | 5.1x |\n| Market Cap (Oct 11) | $409M | $5.3B | $2.4B | $1.1B |\n- **Edge**: Gray cheaper valuation (EV/EBITDA 5.5x vs. peers 7-9x); higher political exposure.\n- **Lags**: Higher leverage; smaller scale than NXST.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Affiliates with NBCUniversal, Paramount (CBS), Disney (ABC/FOX); Amazon for Thursday Night Football streaming; Pearl TV consortium for NextGen TV.\n- **Recent M&A**:\n  - Acquired Raycom Media (2019): +63 stations.\n  - Meredith Local Media (2021): +17 stations for $2.7B.\n  - No major 2024 deals; monitoring Quincy Media assets (FCC review ongoing).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Cable MVPDs (Comcast, Charter, DirecTV: ~$1.2B annual retrans); advertisers (auto, retail, pharma); political PACs (DNC/RNC, $100M+ 2024 bookings).\n- **Potential Clients**: Streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube TV retrans hikes); CTV ad buyers via Impact Labs.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong localism (community awards); D+ rating from Sustainalytics (peer avg B-).\n- **Management**: CEO Hilton Howell (family-controlled); track record of accretive M&A.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (FCC caps at 39% reach); recession-sensitive ads.\n- **Upside Catalysts**: Post-election multiple expansion; debt refinancing (2025 maturities).\n- **Analyst Consensus** (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11): \"Hold\" (avg PT $7.67; range $6-13).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10 (Sell/Hold)**  \n  Rationale: Election tailwind provides near-term pop (stock +15% post-Q2), but structural TV decline, high debt ($3.1B), and weak core growth cap upside. Moderate risk appetite suits hold for 2024 catalyst, but lacks strong growth for buy.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $7.50 (46% upside from $5.15)  \n  Based on 6.5x 2025E EBITDA ($630M consensus) + net debt adjustment; assumes $225M political realization and digital ramp (DCF model aligned with BofA/Barclays targets). Strong growth portfolio would require deleveraging proof.",

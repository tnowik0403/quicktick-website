Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Current Stock Price:** $112.45 (as of market close January 15, 2026, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $59.32 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, January 15, 2026)  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP), headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, is one of the largest investor-owned electric utilities in the U.S., serving approximately 5.6 million customers across 11 states through its regulated transmission and distribution operations. AEP operates through six regulated utilities—Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Ohio Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric Power Company, and Kentucky Power—primarily in the Midwest, South, and Plains regions. Its ~40,300 MW generating fleet includes a mix of natural gas (42%), coal (20%), renewables (18%, including wind, solar, and hydro), nuclear (10%), and others as of Q3 2025.\n\nHistorically reliant on coal, AEP has accelerated its clean energy transition, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Key assets include 2,200 miles of high-voltage transmission lines under development and a growing renewables portfolio exceeding 6 GW. Regulated operations ensure stable cash flows via rate recovery, with transmission investments (~$4B annually) driving growth. AEP's vertically integrated model spans generation, transmission (40,000+ miles of lines), and distribution, but it has divested non-core assets (e.g., AEP Transmission Holdco to KKR in 2022). Amid rising electricity demand from data centers and EVs, AEP emphasizes grid modernization, renewables expansion, and resilient infrastructure. Q3 2025 earnings (reported October 30, 2025) showed operating EPS of $1.84, up 7% YoY, with full-year 2025 guidance of $5.30-$5.50 EPS.

Company Overview\n\nAmerican Electric Power (AEP) is one of the largest electric utility companies in the United States, serving more than 5.6 million customers in 11 states. The company is one of the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning approximately 29,000 megawatts of generating capacity and operates the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 40,000-mile network that includes more 765 kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines than all other U.S. transmission systems combined. AEP was incorporated in 1906 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). The company operates through four main business segments: Vertically Integrated Utilities, Transmission and Distribution Utilities, AEP Transmission Holdco, and Generation & Marketing.\n\nThe company generates, transmits, and distributes electricity using coal, lignite, natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro sources. Beyond traditional utility operations, AEP has expanded into competitive energy markets through subsidiaries like AEP Energy, which provides retail electricity and natural gas services in deregulated markets.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nThe American Electric Power Company Inc stock price today is 113.04. The stock has experienced a 27.67% change over the past year, with a 52-week range between 89.91 and 123.73. AEP has a market capitalization of 63.08 billion, which has increased by 1.63% over the last week. The dividend yield (TTM) is 3.17% with the last dividend per share at 0.95 USD.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nAEP's primary business consists of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution services across its regulated utilities. The company produces power using coal, lignite, natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro sources with the company's energy capacity primarily derived from coal (42%), natural gas (27%), renewable energy and hydro (21%), nuclear (8%), and demand response (2%).\n\nThrough AEP Energy, the company provides retail supplier services for electricity and natural gas, buying bulk energy from the source and selling it directly to consumers at a competitive rate. Founded in 2002, AEP Energy operates in 28 service territories across Delaware, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Washington D.C. as a certified retail energy supplier.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nAEP has unveiled an ambitious transformation strategy centered on massive infrastructure investments and renewable energy expansion. AEP expects to invest $72 billion from 2026 through 2030 to enhance service for customers and support the growing energy needs of communities. This represents an increase of 33% from AEP's previous five-year capital expenditure plan, partly driven by 765-kV transmission projects in Texas and the PJM Interconnection region.\n\nAEP has almost $10 billion of planned renewables projects in its current five-year, $54 billion plan. Additionally, in November, AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, with an option to buy up to 1 GW in total by the end of this year. The company is also pursuing early site permits for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in Indiana and Virginia to provide clean, reliable energy for significant load growth.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAEP's growth strategy is fundamentally driven by unprecedented electricity demand growth, particularly from data centers and large industrial customers. The company has confidence in 28 gigawatts (GW) of load additions by 2030, backed by Electric Service Agreements or Letters of Agreement, with AEP's peak system demand expected to surge to 65 GW by 2030, up from a current peak of 37 GW.\n\nAEP forecasts 8%-9% annual retail load growth from 2025-2027, which would add more than 52 million MWh to retail sales. American Electric Power expects its utilities will interconnect 24 GW of new load by 2030, with 18 GW coming from data centers.\n\nThe growth strategy includes three key investment areas: AEP is investing $30 billion in transmission assets, more than $20 billion in generation resources across the service territory in the next five years, and $17 billion dedicated to AEP's distribution network.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAEP's customer base includes a diverse mix of residential, commercial, and industrial users, with major developments in large-scale commercial customers driving significant growth.

In ERCOT, the pending load includes about 5 GW in cryptocurrency operations and 2 GW in data centers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nAEP delivered strong financial performance in 2024. Year-end 2024 GAAP earnings were $2.97 billion or $5.60 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $2.21 billion or $4.26 per share for year-end 2023. Year-end 2024 operating earnings were $2.98 billion or $5.62 per share, compared with operating earnings of $2.72 billion or $5.25 per share for year-end 2023.\n\nFor Q4 2024 specifically, AEP reported GAAP earnings of $664 million or $1.25 per share, compared with GAAP earnings of $336 million or $0.64 per share in fourth-quarter 2023. Revenue increased year-over-year from $18.98 billion to $19.72 billion.\n\nThe company's reaffirmation of its 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share, along with a long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, highlights its commitment to sustainable growth.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The exceptionally strong load growth, particularly from large commercial and industrial customers and data centers, represents a significant, long-term tailwind for AEP. The $54 billion capital plan from 2025-2029 is expected to drive an ~8% rate base CAGR.\n- U.S. electricity demand is accelerating at its fastest pace since the 1950s–70s, driven by the rise of AI-powered mega data centers, manufacturing reshoring, and transportation electrification. In response, utilities are investing record capital to expand generation and modernize grid infrastructure, with hyper-scalers (AMZN, MSFT, META, GOOG) actively partnering to secure long-term power capacity.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Financial Market Volatility: The cost of capital is a constant headwind. Volatility in financial markets affects the availability and cost of funds needed to finance their new capital projects and refinance existing debt.\n- Equity raises to fund growth (In 2025, ETR, AEP, and more to come). Weather event risks, particularly wildfires.\n- There was a \"bubbling unease\" around rate affordability among utilities as they manage unprecedented capital investment requirements.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAEP operates in regulated markets where direct market share comparisons are challenging, but the company maintains a dominant position in its service territories. AEP serves 5.6 million customers in 11 states and operates the nation's largest electricity transmission system spanning 40,000 miles. The company is one of the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nKey investor-owned utilities operating in similar regions represent significant rivals. These include entities such as Exelon, Duke Energy, Southern Company, and Xcel Energy. These major players share comparable business models centered on energy generation, transmission, and distribution.\n\nAEP's competitive advantages lie in its diverse energy portfolio, operational efficiency, and strong financial performance. The company's competitive edge is enhanced by owning and operating the nation's largest electricity transmission system, spanning nearly 40,000 miles, and over 225,000 miles of distribution lines.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Strategic Partnerships:**\n- KKR and PSP Investments completed a transaction in June 2025 to jointly invest $2.82 billion for a 19.9% equity interest in AEP's Ohio and Indiana Michigan transmission companies.\n- AEP announced a strategic partnership with Quanta Services under a Cooperation and Commitment Agreement to collaborate on the design, engineering, procurement and construction of 765 kV and other high-voltage transmission facilities.\n- The Midcontinent Independent System Operator selected a joint venture of American Electric Power and Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiaries to build a $1.2 billion, 765-kV transmission project in Wisconsin.\n\n## 12.

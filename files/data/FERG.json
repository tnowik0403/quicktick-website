Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, the company operates approximately 1,734 locations across all 50 U.S. states, Canada, and Puerto Rico, serving residential, non-residential, repair & remodel (R&M), and new construction end-markets through its three main segments: Residential, Non-Residential, and Canada (as of FY2024 reporting). Ferguson provides value-added services including inventory management, job-site delivery, technical support, and fabrication, catering to professional contractors, builders, and facility managers.\n\nHistorically spun out from Wolseley plc in 2012 (U.S. operations) and fully rebranded to Ferguson plc in 2020 after acquiring the remaining Wolseley North American assets, the company has pursued aggressive expansion via organic branch openings and bolt-on acquisitions. In FY2024 (ended July 31, 2024), Ferguson generated revenue primarily from plumbing (42%), HVAC (22%), waterworks (21%), and other categories, with 93% of sales from the U.S. Its business model leverages scale for procurement advantages, digital platforms like Ferguson Connect for e-commerce (now ~20% of sales), and a decentralized structure with local expertise. Despite cyclical housing exposure, Ferguson has demonstrated resilience through market share gains, with Non-Residential sales (53% of FY2024 total) offsetting Residential softness. The company employs ~37,000 associates and emphasizes ESG initiatives, including sustainability in supply chains and diversity goals.

Rationale: Persistent share gains (+250bps FY24), Non-Resi tailwinds (data centers), $2B+ buyback capacity, undervalued at 21x FY25 EPS est. vs. peers 24x. Moderate risk via housing (~30% exposure) offset by diversification/FCS.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $245 (15% upside from $212.42). DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth) using FY25 consensus ($32B rev, $11 EPS); aligns with Baird/Stephens PTs ($250 avg, Oct 2024 updates). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns. Hold if risk-averse; Sell only sub-$180.",

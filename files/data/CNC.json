This includes 51 new counties across eight markets, with a focus on Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), enhancements to the Wellcare Spendables® card and improving member experience.\n\nAs part of their evolving support and product offerings for dual-eligible members, Wellcare will launch the first phase of its enhanced integrated Duals model across eight states – Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas – as part of the broader transition of MMPs to integrated D-SNPs effective Jan 1, 2026. Wellcare currently offers MMPs in five of the eight launch states (Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas) and will seamlessly transition members in those markets to new integrated D-SNPs that administer both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nCentene (CNC) demonstrates resilience through strategic cost management, operational efficiencies, and a strong focus on government-sponsored plans like Medicaid and Medicare Advantage. Membership growth and localized services create a competitive edge, though uncertainties tied to federal subsidies and Medicaid redetermination pose risks. Despite these challenges, CNC's diversified revenue base, efficiency measures, and potential margin expansion support a favorable long-term outlook.\n\nContracts and partnerships are central to Centene Corporation's CNC business model. Centene is one of the largest managed care providers across Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. The company's growth is closely linked to winning, renewing, and expanding government contracts, which ensure steady, recurring revenues while strengthening Centene's scale advantage.\n\nWe believe these adjustments set us up well for margin recovery in 2026. We remain committed to the exchange business, focusing on margin recovery in 2026. Long-term stability depends on policy changes, particularly eAPTCs.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nCentene has partnerships with 34 state Medicaid programs as of 2023. The company manages Medicaid contracts in 24 states, covering approximately 14.1 million Medicaid members.\n\nIt's a positive development for the insurer, which contracts with 31 states in Medicaid managed care and brings in most of its revenue from the massive insurance program.\n\nWellcare, a company offering a comprehensive range of Medicare products and the Medicare brand of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC), will offer Medicare Advantage (MA) to over 51 million beneficiaries in 32 states and Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) products to more than 8 million members across all 50 states.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:** Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC) reported a better-than-expected adjusted EPS of $0.50 for the third quarter, surpassing previous expectations. Centene's sales surged 18.2% year-over-year to $49.69 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $47.75 billion.\n\n**Guidance Updates:** The company increased its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to at least $2, up from the previous forecast of $1.75 per share. As we look at the full year 2025, we are increasing our 2025 adjusted EPS forecast from the previous $1.75 to at least $2, driven by early execution on the improved Florida CMS revenue.\n\n**Impairment Charges:** The company experienced a GAAP loss per share of $13.50 due to a $6.7 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge.\n\n**Annual Results:** In 2024, Centene's revenue was $147.17 billion, an increase of 4.09% compared to the previous year's $141.39 billion. Earnings were $3.31 billion, an increase of 22.32%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The introduction of Ambetter Health Solutions, plans compatible with Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs) in select states, stands out. This supports the company's efforts to reach more individuals and employers, tying directly to current catalysts, such as strength in the commercial segment and increased Marketplace enrollments potentially driving premium revenue growth.\n- However, Centene was helped by states bumping their Medicaid payment rates.\n- But roughly 40% of its Medicaid business received an average rate increase of 4.5% at the start of 2025, which \"contributed to underlying improvement\" in Centene's performance, London said.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- The Company's Medicaid business has experienced a step-up in medical cost trend in the same areas previously identified by the Company: behavioral health, home health and high-cost drugs. These dynamics were more pronounced in specific geographies, such as New York and Florida, including carve-ins of related services without sufficient rate or risk adjustment.\n- Centene's stock outlook is negatively influenced by a projected reduction in its portfolio of low-cost Silver positions, anticipating a decline from 55% in 2025 to 42% by 2026, which may impact revenue stability in upcoming years. Additionally, the company faces a significant pre-tax earnings impact of approximately $2.4 billion due to recent data from Wakely, indicating risks related to risk adjustment estimates that are now lower than previously anticipated by $1.8 billion to $2.75 billion.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAs of December 2024, Centene served 22 million medical members, with a significant portion in Medicaid (about 60% of membership), followed by the individual exchanges (about 20%), and Medicare (about 5%).\n\nCNC is the top Medicaid managed care organization (MCO) in the US with roughly 13 million members enrolled as of 1Q25, representing roughly 17% of the total US Medicaid population, and also holds the top spot in the private health insurance marketplace.\n\nAlready the largest marketplace carrier, those low-priced plans helped drive 1.2 million new members to Centene's ACA coverage since the end of 2024, bringing the insurer's total ACA membership to 5.6 million people.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe main competitors of UnitedHealth Group include Elevance Health (ELV), The Cigna Group (CI), Humana (HUM), Centene (CNC), Molina Healthcare (MOH), Oscar Health (OSCR), Alignment Healthcare (ALHC), Clover Health Investments (CLOV), Trupanion (TRUP), and NeueHealth (NEUE).\n\nUnitedHealth Group maintains its position as the market leader with projected revenues of $450-455 billion, while competitors like Elevance Health, Centene, Cigna, Humana, and CVS Health continue evolving their business models to address changing healthcare needs.\n\nCentene is the country's largest Medicaid managed care organization. It also operates in the United Kingdom.\n\nDespite this robust long-term growth profile, shares are trading at just 7.5x 2026 EPS estimates, a level only seen during the depths of the global financial crisis, and a nearly 45% discount to peers (UNH, MOH, HUM, ELV).\n\n## 11.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating:** 6.8/10\n\n**Rationale:** Centene presents a complex investment opportunity that balances significant challenges with structural advantages. The company's dominant position in Medicaid (largest MCO in the US) and marketplace insurance provides defensive characteristics and recurring revenue streams. However, recent operational challenges including the $6.7 billion goodwill impairment, Medicaid margin pressures, and guidance withdrawal significantly impact near-term prospects.\n\n**Positive Factors:**\n- Market leadership in Medicaid (17% market share) and ACA Marketplace\n- Diversified revenue base across government-sponsored programs\n- Strong membership growth trajectory (22 million medical members)\n- Significant valuation discount (45% below peers)\n- Recovery initiatives showing early progress (Q3 2025 beat expectations)\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Regulatory and policy uncertainty around ACA subsidies\n- Medicaid margin pressures from medical cost inflation\n- Recent massive goodwill impairment indicating prior overvaluation\n- Marketplace morbidity trends affecting profitability\n\n**Fair Value Estimate:** $52.00\n\nThis fair value reflects a balanced assessment considering Centene's:\n- Trading at 7.5x 2026 EPS estimates vs historical average of 11.2x\n- Strong defensive market position in essential healthcare services\n- Expected margin recovery in 2026 with rate adjustments\n- Conservative approach accounting for near-term headwinds\n\nThe estimated fair value represents approximately 14% upside from current levels, making it suitable for investors with moderate risk appetite seeking value plays in defensive healthcare sectors with long-term demographic tailwinds.",

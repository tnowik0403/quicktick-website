The company operates one of the nation's largest Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), with a strong emphasis on underinsured and uninsured populations. Centene delivers localized care through a diversified portfolio including Medicaid (core focus), Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (PDP), Medicare Advantage (MA), Health Insurance Marketplace (individual exchange plans), and commercial employer-sponsored insurance. As of Q2 2024, it served approximately 28.2 million medical members across all lines, with Medicaid comprising the majority (~22.3 million members). The company emphasizes value-based care, behavioral health integration (via legacy Magellan acquisition), and pharmacy benefits management. Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Centene operates in 50 states through subsidiaries like WellCare (acquired 2020) and Ambetter (Marketplace brand). It generates revenue primarily from capitated premiums (~95% of total), with services and premiums totaling $39.8 billion in Q2 2024. Centene's strategy centers on membership growth in high-margin segments like Marketplace and MA, while navigating regulatory-driven Medicaid volatility. Its scale enables cost efficiencies, robust local provider networks, and tech investments in analytics for risk adjustment and utilization management.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 25, 2024)**: Premium and service revenues $39.8 billion (up 4% YoY); health benefits ratio (HBR) 88.5%; adjusted diluted EPS $2.42 (beat consensus $2.26). Medicaid membership down 3% YoY to 22.3 million due to redeterminations, offset by Marketplace growth to 4.1 million members (up 38% YoY).\n- **FY2024 Guidance Raised (July 25, 2024)**: Adjusted EPS guidance to $7.25-$7.45 (from $7.10-$7.30);

(3) Medicaid retention post-redeterminations via targeted reenrollment; (4) Value-based care shift (20%+ of payments at risk).\n- **Investments**: $500M+ annually in tech/AI for claims processing and risk coding; pharmacy carve-in opportunities in 10+ states.\n- **Membership Targets**: Stabilize Medicaid at 21-22 million; grow Marketplace to 5 million+ by 2025; MA to 500k+ members by 2026.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Medicaid membership churn from redeterminations (-2.5M net since 2023); rising medical costs (SG&A pressure); regulatory scrutiny on risk adjustment. | Strong Marketplace pricing discipline (2.4% HBR improvement YoY Q2); cost savings from divestitures ($1.5B targeted). |\n| **Sector-Wide** | CMS rate cuts in Medicaid/MA; election risk (ACA/Medicaid expansion); inflation in Rx/drug costs. | ACA enhancements (enhanced subsidies to 2025); aging population boosting MA/PDP; bipartisan Medicaid support. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Medicaid MCO**: Core offering;

Marketplace/MA growth to +5% overall share by 2026, driven by 10%+ non-Medicaid CAGR (company guidance).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | CNC | UNH (UNH) | ELV (ELV) | MOH (MOH) |\n|----------------------------|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Medicaid Members (M)** | 22.3 | 7.5 | 3.2 | 5.5 |\n| **Marketplace Share** | 25% | 5% | 10% | 8% |\n| **Adj EPS Growth YoY** | +10% | +8% | -5% | +15% |\n| **Forward P/E** | 8.9 | 18.5 | 14.2 | 12.1 |\n| **Medicaid Focus** | Highest | Diversified | Diversified | High |\n| **Edge** | Scale/cost efficiency | Overall size/tech | Commercial | Pure-play Medicaid |\n\nCNC leads in Medicaid pure-play scale but trails UNH in margins/diversification;

Google Cloud for data analytics (2023).\n- **Recent M&A/Divestitures**:\n  - Sold WellCare Kentucky Medicare to Molina (closed Q1 2024, $200M proceeds).\n  - Divested Circle Health Group (international, May 2024, $1B+ value).\n  - No major acquisitions since WellCare (2020); focus on organic tuck-ins.\n- **Pipeline**: Monitoring MA bolt-ons; potential carve-in JVs.\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: 40+ state Medicaid programs (e.g., TX STAR+PLUS: 1.8M members; NY: 1.2M); federal ACA exchanges.\n- **Potential**: Additional MA states (target 20 by 2026); Medicaid carve-outs in OH, PA (RFPs 2025); employer wins via WellCare commercial.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong diversity (50%+ diverse board); sustainability via telehealth reducing emissions.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (DOJ probes on billing, ongoing); litigation (cyberattack settlements).\n- **Moats**: Local networks (500k+ providers); data trove for MLR optimization.\n- **Analyst Consensus**: 12 Buy, 10 Hold, 1 Sell (avg target $85.50, per Yahoo Finance Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold to Buy)**: Attractive valuation (forward P/E <9x vs. sector 15x) with Marketplace/MA tailwinds offsetting Medicaid normalization. Moderate risk from regs/elections balanced by raised guidance and buybacks.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $85 (25% upside from $68.22)**: Based on 12x FY2025 adj EPS midpoint ($7.10), aligned with historical multiples and 8-10% EPS CAGR through 2026. Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios (strong non-Medicaid levers) with moderate risk (diversified payers, $3B cash). Upside if MA scales; downside to $65 on redetermination misses.",

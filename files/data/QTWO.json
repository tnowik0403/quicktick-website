(NYSE: QTWO) is a leading provider of cloud-based digital banking and lending solutions primarily targeting small- to mid-sized financial institutions (FIs) in the U.S., such as community banks and credit unions. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company offers its flagship Q2 Digital Banking Platform, a comprehensive, SaaS-based suite that enables FIs to deliver personalized digital experiences to consumers and businesses. Key functionalities include mobile and online banking, account opening, deposit management, lending origination and servicing, payments (ACH, wires, RTP), fraud prevention, financial wellness tools, and data analytics.\n\nQ2 serves over 580 live customers, processing $193 billion in deposits and $24 billion in loan originations annually as of Q3 2024. The platform's open architecture supports integrations with third-party fintechs via APIs, emphasizing scalability, security (SOC 2 compliant), and rapid deployment (average 90-120 days). Revenue is predominantly subscription-based (91% in Q3 2024), providing high recurring visibility through annual recurring revenue (ARR).

Moderate risk from FI cyclicality offset by 91% recurring revenue and $644M ARR visibility. Trading at 6.8x EV/ARR (discount to peers), with upside from AI modules and share gains.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $95/share** (32% upside from $71.92).  \nDCF-based (15% WACC, 18% 2025-2027 growth tapering to 10%; terminal 3% GDP), aligned with 8-9x FY2025 ARR ($800M implied). Portfolio fit: High growth (20%+ EPS upside), moderate volatility (beta 1.4). Hold if risk-averse.",

(MTZ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close on Oct 10, 2024)  \n**Current Stock Price:** $143.16 (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq verified)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $11.34 billion (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq verified)  \n**52-Week Range:** $57.40 - $148.75  \n\n## Company Overview (218 words)\nMasTec, Inc. (MTZ) is a leading U.S.-based infrastructure construction company specializing in the engineering, building, installation, maintenance, and upgrade of critical communications, energy, and utility infrastructure. Operating through five key segments—Clean Energy & Infrastructure (CE&I), Communications, Oil & Gas, Power Delivery, and Other—the company executes large-scale projects nationwide and in select international markets like Canada and Latin America. MasTec serves high-growth sectors including renewable energy (wind, solar, battery storage), power transmission and distribution, 5G/wireless networks, fiber broadband, pipelines, and data centers. With approximately 32,000 employees and a backlog exceeding $12 billion (as of Q2 2024), MasTec benefits from long-term secular trends like the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and booming demand for AI-driven data centers. The company has transformed from a telecom-focused player into a diversified infrastructure leader, with CE&I now its largest segment (49% of Q2 revenue). Recent strategic acquisitions and organic growth have positioned Mastec for multi-year expansion amid energy transition and digitalization megatrends, though execution risks persist in a cyclical industry.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 31, 2024, verified transcript via Seeking Alpha/Earnings call):** Revenue $2.89B (up 1% YoY), adjusted EBITDA $243M (up 18%), net income $78.2M.

Hold only if risk-averse to execution volatility.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $175 (22% upside) – Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($1.1B midpoint guidance, 10% CAGR), peer avg multiple adjustment for superior growth.

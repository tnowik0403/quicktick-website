Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\nRevenues of $3.97 billion topped the consensus mark of $3.89 billion by 1.6%. The top line jumped 22% from a year ago, driven by double-digit growth across all segments. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded expectations, coming in at $2.48, which was $0.20 ahead of consensus. Adjusted EBITDA: $374 million, a 20% year-over-year increase.\n\n### 2025 Guidance\nWe are increasing 2025 full-year revenue guidance to $14.075 billion with adjusted EBITDA of $1.135 billion, slightly above the low end of our previous guidance.

MasTec delivered record Q3 results, with 21% y/y backlog growth to $16.8B, providing strong revenue visibility into 2026. MTZ's $16.8B backlog, up 21% y/y, secures nearly 1.2x annual revenue, ensuring robust multi-year growth visibility and supporting double-digit revenue expansion into 2026.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\nMTZ is benefiting from record project backlogs and robust demand across multiple end markets, led by its Pipeline Infrastructure segment. Increased multi-year government investments supporting grid reliability, LNG expansion and energy transition infrastructure are driving growth. This robust growth is fueled by dynamic telecom infrastructure demand, as customers make substantial capital investments in broadband delivery and advanced AI applications. MasTec's wireless business is expanding geographically and broadening its service offerings, while wireline demand is surging due to extensive broadband infrastructure build-outs by traditional carriers, cable operators, and new fiber overbuilders.\n\n### Headwinds\nWeather-related delays continue to pose execution risks, with MasTec's Power Delivery segment experiencing frequent disruptions despite mitigation efforts. The company also operates in a highly competitive, fragmented industry, where intense competition from national, local and in-house providers could pressure market share and profitability.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nMarket Share of MasTec, Inc.: Estimated around 5-7% (2025) in the infrastructure engineering and construction services sector. MasTec's market share is in the mid-single digits, indicating a strong but not dominant position.\n\n### Segment Performance\nClean Energy and Infrastructure (contributing 33% to total 2023 revenues), Communications (27.2%), Power Delivery (22.8%), Oil and Gas (17.3%).\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nMastec competitors include MYR Group, Quanta Services, EMCOR Group, Crown Castle and Dycom Industries. Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR): around 10-12%, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE: J): around 7-9%, KBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR): around 6-8%, EMCOR Group, Inc. (NYSE: EME): around 5-7%.\n\nEMCOR Group's price-to-earnings ratio is 19.01x while MasTec's PE ratio is 51.79x. While competitors like Quanta Services (PWR) may exhibit larger scale in certain energy infrastructure segments and potentially higher overall profitability margins, MasTec's versatility and integrated approach allow it to capture market share in multi-segment projects. Similarly, against specialized electrical contractors like MYR Group (MYRG), MasTec's broader infrastructure solutions offer a more holistic value proposition.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nThe company was formed by the merger of two separate companies: Burnup & Sims and Church & Tower. This journey has involved both significant organic expansion and targeted acquisitions, such as Henkels McCoy Holdings, Inc. in 2021 and IEA in 2022, which, despite initial integration challenges, have broadened MasTec's capabilities and market reach.\n\nMasTec's most recent deal was a Merger/Acquisition with NV2A. The deal was made on 22-Dec-2025.\n\n## 12.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of MasTec's strong fundamentals, diversified business model, record backlog providing exceptional revenue visibility, and position to capitalize on multi-year infrastructure investment trends driven by energy transition, 5G deployment, and data center demand:\n\n**Buy Rating: 8.5/10**\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $275**\n\n**Key Investment Strengths:**\n- Record $16.8B backlog providing 1.2x revenue coverage and multi-year visibility\n- Diversified platform across high-growth secular trends (5G, renewable energy, data centers)\n- Strong Q3 2025 performance with 22% revenue growth and 20% EBITDA growth\n- Strategic position in critical infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry\n- Management guidance for over $15B revenue and $8+ EPS by 2026\n\n**Investment Risks:**\n- High valuation multiple (P/E ~58x) creates limited margin for error\n- Weather/permitting delays impact project execution timing\n- Competitive, fragmented industry with margin pressure risks\n\nThe investment thesis is supported by MasTec's unique positioning at the convergence of multiple infrastructure megatrends, exceptional backlog visibility, and proven ability to execute large-scale projects across diversified end markets. While the stock trades at a premium, the company's strong growth trajectory and secular tailwinds justify the valuation for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance.",

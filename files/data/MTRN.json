Headquartered in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, the company specializes in mission-critical materials like beryllium and beryllium alloys (e.g., AlBeMet, Lockalloy), electronic-grade thin films and powders, precision optical coatings, and tantalum-based products. Materion operates through three segments: Performance Materials (beryllium products for satellites, missiles, and optics), Electronic Materials (semiconductor sputtering targets and services for chipmakers), and Precision Optics (thin-film coatings for lasers and sensors). With ~3,100 employees and facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, Materion holds a dominant position in beryllium production (virtually the sole Western supplier post-U.S. export restrictions on China). In FY2023, sales were driven by defense demand (e.g., hypersonics) and semiconductor recovery, with ~46% of revenue from electronics. The company emphasizes vertical integration, from mining/refining beryllium ore to finished components, enabling high margins (Q2 2024 gross margin: 22.4%). Strategic focus on electrification, space exploration, and 5G/AI positions Materion for secular growth amid supply chain localization trends.

Moderate risk via diversified segments/moat. Outperforms peers on margins.\n- **Fair Value Price Target:** $155 (17% upside from $132.84)  \n  *Valuation:* 20x FY2025E EPS $7.75 (conservative vs. 28x current; DCF implies $160 with 9% WACC, 4% terminal growth). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15%+ annualized returns. Hold if risk aversion rises on semi slowdown.",

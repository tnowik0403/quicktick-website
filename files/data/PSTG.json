(PSTG) is a leading provider of enterprise data storage solutions, specializing in all-flash arrays and software-defined storage platforms. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, the company delivers high-performance, non-disruptive storage through its Purity Operating System, which powers its core products: FlashArray (block storage for databases and VMs) and FlashBlade (file/object storage for AI/ML and analytics). Pure's \"Evergreen\" subscription model offers perpetual hardware upgrades without forklift replacements, reducing customer CapEx and emphasizing recurring revenue via subscriptions (now ~70% of total revenue). Targeting enterprise IT, service providers, and hyperscalers, Pure focuses on simplifying data management amid exploding unstructured data growth from AI. With ~3,000 employees and a $1.3B+ subscription ARR, Pure competes in the $50B+ all-flash array (AFA) and high-end storage market by prioritizing efficiency, ransomware protection (via Purity ActiveCluster), and AI-ready infrastructure.

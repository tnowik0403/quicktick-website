Growth Strategy\n\nPure Storage's growth strategy centers on three key pillars:\n\n**Subscription Transition:** Pure Storage is experiencing higher than expected demand for its storage-as-a-service offering, Evergreen//One, which is helping the vendor shift its revenue model from CapEx to subscription. The answer lies not just in its all-flash technology, but in its subscription model, which saw its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) jump to $1.7 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase. Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) hit $1.7 billion by the end of FY2025, growing 21% year-over-year.\n\n**Hyperscaler Expansion:** The company is now in advanced negotiations with a top-four hyperscaler (likely Meta, AWS, or Google) to replace its core disk storage with Pure's DirectFlash Modules (DFM). This deal—projected to close by fiscal year-end—could unlock a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.\n\n**AI-Driven Growth:** CEO Charles Giancarlo's vision is clear: \"We're not just selling storage—we're enabling the AI economy.\" This focus is paying off. Subscription revenue tied to AI-driven customers is accelerating, and the company's $1.6 billion ARR (up 22% year-over-year) now includes a growing slice from enterprise AI adopters.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Current Customer Base:** Customer count rose by 258 in the quarter to take the total past 14,000, with 63 percent of the Fortune 500 included.

(NYSE: YETI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $37.04 (closing price on October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.23 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $33.42 - $61.57  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company investor relations, Edgar filings, Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC articles (Oct 2024), Q2 2024 earnings call transcript (Aug 8, 2024), recent analyst reports (e.g., TD Cowen, Piper Sandler downgrades Sep-Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nYETI Holdings, Inc. is a leading designer, marketer, retailer, and distributor of premium outdoor and recreational products, emphasizing extreme durability, superior insulation, and lifestyle appeal. Founded in 2006 in Austin, Texas, by brothers Roy and Ryan Seiders, the company initially gained fame for its iconic Tundra hard coolers, born from the founders' dissatisfaction with flimsy alternatives during fishing trips. Today, YETI operates in three segments: Cooler (hard/soft coolers, cargo), Drinkware (tumblers, bottles, mugs like Rambler series), and Other (bags, outdoor living like chairs/tables, dog gear, apparel). Products are sold via direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce (yeti.com), wholesale to ~4,000 retailers (e.g., REI, Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops), and international markets.\n\nYETI targets affluent consumers seeking \"built-for-life\" gear for outdoor adventures, tailgating, work, and everyday use. With a cult-like brand loyalty (Net Promoter Score ~70+ per earnings calls), it commands premium pricing (2-3x competitors). Revenue mix: Drinkware ~50%, Coolers ~30%, Other ~20% (Q2 2024). International sales (Europe, Australia, ~10% of revenue) are growing fastest. The company went public in 2018 at $18/share. As of Q2 2024, it has ~3,000 employees, no debt, and $414M cash. Challenges include macroeconomic sensitivity and competition, but strengths lie in innovation, marketing (e.g., NFL/MLB partnerships), and DTC expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported Aug 8, 2024):** Net sales $387.6M (+1% YoY); gross profit $221.2M (57.1% margin, +160bps YoY); net income $52.6M; diluted EPS $0.60 (+3% YoY).

Based on 20x FY2025 EPS ($2.45 consensus, per Yahoo/Oct 2024), 10% sales CAGR to 2027, 55% margins. DCF implies $45-52 (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth).

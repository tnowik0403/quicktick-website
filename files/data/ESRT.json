(ESRT) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership, management, operation, and acquisition of office and retail properties primarily in the New York metropolitan area. Founded in 2013 following the spin-off from Malkin Holdings, ESRT's portfolio is anchored by iconic assets like the Empire State Building (ESB), Empire State Plaza, and One Grand Central Place, totaling approximately 8.7 million rentable square feet as of Q2 2024. The company generates revenue through office leasing (about 80% of net operating income), retail space, and the high-margin Empire State Building Observatory (ESBO), which draws millions of tourists annually and contributed significantly to profitability amid office market challenges.\n\nESRT differentiates itself via its \"trophy\" properties in prime Manhattan locations, focusing on Class-A office spaces with modern amenities, sustainability upgrades (e.g., ENERGY STAR certifications), and experiential tourism via ESBO. The REIT has navigated post-pandemic headwinds by emphasizing short-term leasing flexibility, observatory resilience (record 2023 visitation), and diversification into multifamily conversions. With a market cap of $2.15B, ESRT trades at a forward P/FFO multiple of ~13x (based on consensus estimates), below REIT peers, reflecting NYC office sector pressures but offering upside from tourism recovery and strategic repositioning.

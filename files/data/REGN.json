Existing Products/Services\n\nRegeneron has a diverse portfolio of approved medicines across multiple therapeutic areas:\n\n**Ophthalmology:**\n- EYLEA injection to treat wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema; myopic choroidal neovascularization; diabetic retinopathy; neovascular glaucoma; and retinopathy of prematurity.\n- EYLEA HD showing growth of 66% year-over-year. According to Schleifer, fourth-quarter 2025 net sales, including Eylea HD and Eylea, reached upwards of $1.1 billion in the U.S.\n\n**Immunology & Inflammatory Diseases:**\n- Dupixent injection to treat atopic dermatitis and asthma in adults and pediatrics. Dupixent continues to be the world-leading treatment for diseases driven by type 2 inflammation, adding recent FDA approvals for bullous pemphigoid and chronic spontaneous urticaria, the seventh and eighth distinct indications for this important medicine. In June 2025, the FDA approved Dupixent for the treatment of adults with bullous pemphigoid.\n\n**Oncology:**\n- Libtayo injection to treat metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell. Libtayo® (cemiplimab) exceeded $1 billion in sales for 2024 and remains foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio.\n\n**Other Products:**\n- Inmazeb injection for infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus; ARCALYST injection for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes; ZALTRAP injection for intravenous infusion to treat metastatic colorectal cancer; Evkeeza for treatment of HoFH; Ordspono for Follicular lymphoma and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; and Veopoz for CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nRegeneron has approximately 45 product candidates in clinical development:\n\n**Key Pipeline Programs for 2026:**\n- Factor XI antibodies: Includes next-generation anticoagulants designed to optimize efficacy while minimizing bleeding risk, with multiple phase III trials planned for 2026, addressing stroke prevention, post-surgical DVT, and atrial fibrillation.\n- Obesity: The company is looking to fast-track programs combining its in-licensed GLP-1 therapy with proprietary antibodies to address comorbid conditions to enable a holistic therapeutic approach.\n- Additional Phase 3 development is planned to begin in the first half of 2026 for allergen-blocking antibodies for cat and birch allergies.\n- U.S. regulatory submission for cemdisiran monotherapy is planned for the first quarter of 2026, pending discussions with the FDA.\n\n**Technology Partnerships:**\n- Global collaboration with Tessera Therapeutics, Inc. is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory agency clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nSchleifer emphasized Regeneron's continued focus on internal R&D investment, mentioning the company is allocating an estimated $6 billion in 2026 which will be supplemented by $7 billion in U.S. capital expenditures to support manufacturing and research capabilities.\n\nAs Regeneron faces loss of exclusivity for two of its top-performing blockbuster drugs, Eylea and Dupixent, the company will continue to lean on its internal R&D capacity to develop next-generation assets and expand into new indications. Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer said that the company expects to invest $6bn in R&D in 2026, highlighting its strategy to prioritise internal research capabilities.\n\nWhile industry conversations have largely centred around acquisition to combat looming patent cliffs for many companies, Schleifer said large M&A deals often result in \"value destruction.\" He said that companies can often become \"overly reliant\" on external sources and are \"in most cases, dramatically overpaying.\"\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Healthcare Infrastructure:**\n- Regeneron serves 3,500+ hospitals in the United States as of 2023. The company's oncology and ophthalmology product portfolio targets large academic medical centers and regional hospital networks. Regeneron targets 12,500 specialized healthcare providers across ophthalmology, oncology, and immunology specialties.\n\n**Research Collaborations:**\n- To accelerate and scale this process, we invested in Truveta, a network of more than 30 U.S. health systems. Through this collaboration we can now access de-identified, longitudinal clinical data from over 120 million patients in a standardized, scalable way.\n- RTS is leveraged by internal users and thousands of external partners including Clinical Research Organizations (CRO's) and hospitals to exchange and store terabytes of data per day.\n\n**Technology Partners:**\n- Regeneron has worked closely with organizations like the UK Biobank and AWS Partner DNAnexus to get genetic samples and health information from millions of volunteers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Financial Results:**\n- For the third quarter of 2025, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reported total revenues of $3.75 billion.\n- The Sanofi collaboration revenue, driven by Dupixent (dupilumab), was $1.46 billion in Q3 2025, representing a strong increase over the prior year's quarter.\n- U.S. net sales from the EYLEA franchise (EYLEA and EYLEA HD) totaled $1.11 billion. The oncology drug Libtayo (cemiplimab) added $365 million in global net sales.\n\n**Full Year Performance:**\n- Through the first nine months of 2025, reported $10.4 billion in revenue and $3.6 billion in net income.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- In October 2025, the Company reached resolution of its patent infringement litigation related to the Sandoz, Formycon, and Celltrion EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg biosimilar products. The settlements preclude Sandoz, Formycon, and Celltrion from launching their biosimilar products in the United States until the fourth quarter of 2026.\n- In a blow to the transition to the higher dose version, the company received an FDA rejection for a prefilled syringe version of Eylea HD due to an unresolved issue at its manufacturing facility, which is owned by Novo Nordisk. It now awaits a decision on a resubmission for approval expected in Q2 2026.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- In October 2025, the FDA approved an sBLA for Libtayo as an adjuvant treatment for adults with CSCC at high risk of recurrence after surgery and radiation, making Libtayo the first and only immunotherapy approved in this setting.\n- The November 2025 FDA approval for EYLEA HD to treat retinal vein occlusion with a flexible, up to 8-week dosing schedule-a critical move to defend its retinal franchise.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Ophthalmology:**\n- Combined, the Eylea products held 45% of the market, Regeneron said.\n- GlobalData analysts expect the two companies to capture more than 60% of the sector by 2030. With their successful launches of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) drugs for the treatment of retinal diseases, GlobalData analysts expect the two companies to capture more than 60% of the sector by 2030.\n- The ophthalmology drugs market is characterized by intense competition, with four key players commanding a substantial share of global revenues, estimated to be between 80% and 85% of the total market.\n\n**Overall Market Position:**\n- This makes Regeneron Pharmaceuticals the world's 284th most valuable company according to our data.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Ophthalmology Competition with Roche:**\n- Despite facing payer constraints, the Roche and Regeneron treatments are gaining market share and preference among ophthalmologists, according to June 2024 research from Spherix Global Insights on diabetic macular edema prescribing.\n- Tokali is forecasting Vabysmo sales will climb to $3.7 billion in 2024 and reach $7.7 billion by 2030. Tokali is forecasting Eylea HD sales will reach $1.4 billion in 2024 and keep climbing to hit $5.5 billion in 2030.\n- According to Spherix Global Insights' research, 81% of ophthalmologists who use Eylea HD to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are \"highly satisfied,\" which tracks closely to the 87% who say the same about Roche and Genentech's Vabysmo.\n\n**Oncology Competition:**\n- For oncology indications, Regeneron's Libtayo competes against formidable players. Merck & Co.'s Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, and AstraZeneca's Imfinzi are key rivals.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Strategic Partnerships:**\n- Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.\n- The collaboration revenue increase to $1,531.2 million in 2025 from $1,266.8 million in 2024 underscores the financial benefits of these partnerships.\n- The Company announced a 10-year agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (Fujifilm) to manufacture and supply Regeneron's commercial bulk drug product at Fujifilm's North Carolina campus. The agreement is anticipated to nearly double the Company's large-scale manufacturing capacity.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q4 2025/Q1 2026 Updates:**\n- According to Schleifer, fourth-quarter 2025 net sales, including Eylea HD and Eylea, reached upwards of $1.1 billion in the U.S., with Eylea HD showing growth of 66% year-over-year.\n- Eylea HD, which offers a more convenient dosing method to the original drug, had its market potential bolstered by two recent FDA approvals – a indication expansion for treating patients with macular oedema following retinal vein occlusion and a monthly dosing option for some patients in approved indications, in November 2025.\n\n**Pipeline Advances:**\n- In September 2025, Regeneron announced results evaluating its first-in-class investigational allergen-blocking antibodies in allergen-challenge Phase 3 trials in adults with moderate-to-severe cat or birch allergies. Both trials met their respective primary and key secondary endpoints.\n- Regeneron announced new and updated data from its hematology portfolio and pipeline will be shared across 14 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2025 Annual Meeting, taking place from December 6-9 in Orlando, FL.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nRegeneron demonstrates strong fundamentals with a diversified portfolio of blockbuster drugs and robust pipeline. The company's commitment to allocating $6 billion in R&D in 2026 supplemented by $7 billion in U.S. capital expenditures shows dedication to innovation. The company's strong market positions in ophthalmology (45% market share) and immunology, coupled with 14 internally discovered approvals over the past 15 years, demonstrate consistent execution.\n\nHowever, the rating is tempered by upcoming patent cliffs for key products and intense competition from Roche's Vabysmo in the ophthalmology space. Biosimilar threats with settlements precluding launches until Q4 2026 provide temporary relief but highlight future challenges.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $850-900**\n\nThe current trading range around $759-776 appears to undervalue the company given:\n- Strong cash flow generation with 32.13% profit margins\n- Diversified revenue streams across multiple therapeutic areas  \n- Robust pipeline with 45+ candidates in development\n- Strategic partnerships providing stable collaboration revenue\n- Market-leading positions in high-growth therapeutic areas\n\nThe fair value estimate reflects the company's strong fundamentals, innovation capabilities, and growth prospects while acknowledging competitive pressures and patent cliff challenges. For growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance, REGN offers compelling long-term value creation potential.",

(NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company headquartered in Tarrytown, New York, specializing in the discovery, development, and commercialization of monoclonal antibody-based therapies for serious diseases. Founded in 1988, Regeneron leverages its proprietary VelociSuite technologies—including VelocImmune for human antibody generation—to build a robust pipeline targeting oncology, ophthalmology, allergic/inflammatory conditions, and rare diseases. The company's blockbuster products include EYLEA (aflibercept) for retinal diseases, Dupixent (dupilumab, co-commercialized with Sanofi) for atopic dermatitis and asthma, and Libtayo (cemiplimab) for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and other cancers. In 2025, Regeneron reported total revenues of $14.13 billion (per Q4 2025 earnings release on February 4, 2026, covering full FY 2025), driven by 12% YoY growth, with Dupixent collaboration revenues at $4.08 billion (up 15%) and EYLEA family sales at $5.84 billion (down 2% due to biosimilar competition). Gross margins stood at 92% for Q4 2025. Regeneron employs ~12,000 people and invests heavily in R&D (~$4.4 billion in 2025), maintaining a strong balance sheet with $10.2 billion in cash equivalents as of Q4 2025. Strategic partnerships, notably with Sanofi and Bayer, amplify global reach, positioning Regeneron as a top-tier biotech innovator amid sector consolidation and pipeline diversification beyond legacy VEGF inhibitors.

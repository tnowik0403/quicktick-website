The bank operates 19 full-service branches primarily in the Central Valley of California (Sonora to Braden), with additional locations in the Tri-Valley area (Dublin, Danville, San Ramon) and Sacramento region (Roseville). Founded in 1979, OVLY focuses on relationship-based commercial banking for small to medium-sized businesses, agriculture, and professionals. Core offerings include commercial real estate loans, agricultural loans (key in California's ag-heavy Central Valley), commercial lines of credit, SBA loans, and consumer products like mortgages and deposits. As a community bank, it emphasizes local decision-making, personalized service, and conservative underwriting amid California's volatile economy. With total assets of ~$2.5B (Q3 2024), OVLY benefits from strong deposit growth in a high-interest environment but faces regional risks from ag cycles and real estate. The bank's strategy prioritizes organic growth, fee income diversification, and capital strength (CET1 ratio 13.5% as of Q3 2024), positioning it as a regional player in a consolidating banking sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported Oct 22, 2024)**: Net income $7.4M (EPS $0.83, down 4.6% YoY from $7.8M/Q3 2023 due to higher provisions); loans $1.8B (+2.1% YoY); deposits $2.1B (+5.3% YoY); NIM 4.22% (stable).

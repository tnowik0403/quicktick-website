In 2023, GM sold 6.1 million vehicles globally, generating diversified revenue from North America (85%+ of profits), China, and emerging markets. Key segments include GM North America (GMNA, trucks/SUVs like Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra), GM International, and Cruise (autonomous driving unit). GM is aggressively transitioning to EVs via its Ultium battery platform, targeting 1 million EV sales annually in North America by 2025 (delayed from prior goals). Legacy strengths in high-margin internal combustion engine (ICE) trucks/SUVs (e.g., 40%+ U.S. full-size pickup share) fund EV investments amid slowing demand. Recent challenges include EV losses ($1.7B in H1 2024), UAW labor costs post-2023 strike, and Cruise setbacks. Strategic pivots emphasize hybrids, software-defined vehicles, and autonomy. With 163,000 employees and factories in 30+ countries, GM holds ~16% U.S. light-vehicle market share, competing in a $2T+ global auto sector shifting to electrification amid tariffs and supply chain volatility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 23, 2024 (Q2 Earnings):** Reported revenue of $44.08B (down 6.9% YoY), adjusted EPS $2.89 (beat estimates), net income $2.96B.

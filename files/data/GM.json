Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Electric Vehicle Expansion\nBy 2025, the automotive giant plans to invest US$35bn globally in EVs and AVs. The funding will drive advancements in battery technology and expand manufacturing capabilities. By 2035, GM aims to phase out all fuel and diesel-powered vehicles, transitioning to an entirely electric lineup as part of its broader goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\nA new Ultium-based Chevy Bolt will arrive in late 2025, positioned as one of the most affordable EVs. GM expects a $2 billion to $4 billion improvement this year compared with 2024, based on wholesale volumes of about 300,000 EVs.

Fourth-quarter 2024 net income attributable to shareholders was a loss of $3.0 billion and EBIT-adjusted was $2.5 billion.\n\nGM's revenue last year increased to $187.44 billion, up 9.1% from 2023. The adjusted figures and the $14 billion in adjusted auto free cash flow were records for the automaker, GM said.\n\n### 2025 Guidance\nGM has raised its 2025 guidance, projecting a net profit attributable to stockholders in the range of $11.2 billion to $12.5 billion, with EPS diluted around $11.00 to $12.00. GM's 2025 financial guidance assumes a stable policy environment in North America and an estimated benefit of $0.5 billion from reduced year-over-year expenses at Cruise. The financial guidance also includes anticipated capital spending of $10.0 billion - $11.0 billion, inclusive of investments in the company's battery cell manufacturing joint ventures.\n\n### Operating Performance\nIts North American adjusted earnings increased 18.1% compared with 2023 to $14.53 billion, which equates to a 9.2% adjusted profit margin.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- GM's EV sales surged in the second half of 2024. The company delivered 21,930 EVs in the second quarter of 2024, marking a promising 40% increase. The boost is largely attributed to the success of GM's new Ultium battery-based EVs, showcasing its innovation and resilience in the electric vehicle market.\n- GM's U.S. EV sales surged 50% in 2024, and its domestic EV market share doubled. GM's U.S. EV sales surged 50% in 2024.

Market Shares\n\n### U.S. Market Position\nGM, Toyota, and Ford dominate the U.S. auto market with a combined 45% share, marking a continued shift from the traditional \"Big Three\" (GM, Ford, Chrysler), which last held the top three spots in the early 2000s before Toyota overtook Chrysler in 2007.\n\nGeneral Motors led the segment with a 15.6% market share, followed by Toyota (13.3%), Hyundai-Kia (12.6%), Ford (9.6%), and Honda (9.4%).\n\n### EV Market Performance\nChevrolet became the best-selling EV brand. Cadillac led the luxury EV market share. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq are up 50 percent in the U.S. and the electric crossover now accounts for one in five Cadillac sales, second only to the Escalade. The Lyriq is outselling EV nameplates from European luxury brands, Barra said.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Stock Performance\nShares of the Detroit automaker have risen 54.7% ahead of Monday's opening, outperforming legacy competitors, Tesla, and U.S. electric vehicle startups Lucid Group and Rivian Automotive. Even with shares of Tesla surging more than 30% during the past week following President-elect Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election, the electric vehicle maker continues to trail GM.\n\n### Operational Advantages\nGM has done so with the assistance of $12.4 billion in stock buybacks since last November, which the automaker said will continue for the foreseeable future. But it's also proving itself to be operationally better than its crosstown rivals Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, as well as other sector peers.\n\nGM, unlike many competitors, has not lowered its 2024 guidance or underperformed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations. Instead, it's actually raised key financial targets despite facing ongoing market challenges in the U.S. and its Chinese operations losing hundreds of millions of dollars amid increased competition.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Key Joint Ventures\nUltium Cells is a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution that mass-produces battery cells to advance the push for a zero-emissions, all-electric future. Ultium Cells provides battery cell capacity to support GM's North American electric vehicle assembly capacity, while supporting GM's plans to supply other automotive companies and other industries including rail, aerospace, heavy trucking and marine customers.\n\nGM manufactures its fuel cells in Brownstown Charter Township, Michigan, in a joint venture with Honda.\n\n### Cruise Operations\nGM acquired Cruise in 2016. The automaker currently owns about 90% of Cruise and has agreements with other shareholders that will raise its ownership to more than 97%, GM said in a statement. GM anticipates it will complete the acquisition of remaining Cruise shares from outside shareholders by early 2025, CFO Paul Jacobson said Tuesday.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Cruise Restructuring (December 2024)\nGeneral Motors will no longer fund its Cruise division's robotaxi development, the company said on Tuesday. GM said it plans to instead \"realign its autonomous driving strategy\" to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles. GM expects the restructuring to lower spending by more than $1 billion annually after the proposed plan is completed, expected in the first half of 2025.\n\n### Headquarters Relocation (January 2026)\nOn April 15, 2024, GM announced that it would relocate its global headquarters from the Renaissance Center to the nearby Hudson's Detroit development in 2025. As of January 12, 2026 they have begun official occupancy of the site.\n\n### Lithium Investment (October 2024)\nIn October 2024, General Motors increased its investment in lithium production by raising its commitment to Canadian mining company Lithium Americas from $650 million to $945 million. The investment establishes a joint venture with Lithium Americas to develop the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, one of the largest known lithium resources in the United States, positioning GM to meet growing demand for EVs by reducing dependency on foreign lithium sources.\n\n### EV Plans Adjustment (2025)\nIn 2021, GM announced its intent to end production of vehicles using internal combustion engines by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. These plans were mostly scaled back in 2025. These plans were scaled back in 2025, due to lack of customer demand.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of GM's current performance, strategic positioning, and market conditions, I assign the following ratings:\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.8/10**\n\n**Justification:**\n- Strong financial performance with record adjusted EBIT and free cash flow in 2024\n- Leading U.S. market position (15.6% market share) with operational superiority over competitors\n- Successful EV pivot with 50% sales growth in 2024 and market share doubling\n- Robust 2025 guidance ($11.2-12.5B net income) with $1B+ annual savings from Cruise restructuring\n- Strong dividend yield (0.72%) and aggressive share buyback program\n- Technology transformation with $20-25B software revenue target by decade end\n\n**Risks Considered:**\n- China market challenges with $4.41B equity loss in 2024\n- Regulatory uncertainty under Trump administration regarding tariffs and EV policies\n- Competitive EV market with Tesla and emerging players\n- Scaled back EV production targets due to demand concerns\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $95-100**\n\nThis represents approximately 15-20% upside from current levels around $83. The valuation is based on:\n- Forward P/E of ~7-8x based on 2025 guidance\n- Strong cash generation capabilities ($11-13B automotive free cash flow guidance)\n- Multiple expansion potential as EV transformation gains traction\n- Premium valuation justified by market leadership position and operational excellence\n- Software and services revenue diversification reducing cyclical exposure\n\nThe company appears well-positioned for moderate risk appetite investors seeking exposure to the EV transition while maintaining exposure to traditional automotive cash generation. The strategic refocus from robotaxis to personal autonomous systems represents a more capital-efficient path to technology leadership.",

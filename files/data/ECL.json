Founded in 1923 and headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota, the company operates in over 170 countries, serving industries including food & beverage, healthcare, hospitality, industrial processing, and life sciences.

The company emphasizes sustainability, with goals to reduce customers' water and energy use by 50% in key markets by 2030. In 2023, Ecolab generated $15.3 billion in revenue, driven by recurring service models (80%+ of sales) and a vast direct salesforce of ~44,000 associates.

The company operates through two primary platforms: Water Quality (approximately 60% of revenue), which provides analytical instruments, software, services, and chemical treatments for municipal and industrial water management via brands like Hach (instruments and sensors) and ChemTreat (treatment chemicals and services); and Product Quality (approximately 40% of revenue), focused on product identification, inspection, and traceability solutions for packaging and manufacturing through Videojet (coding/printing), Linx (coding), ACH (food safety detection), and BOT Factory (automation). Veralto serves critical end-markets including municipal drinking water, wastewater, industrial processes (power generation, pharmaceuticals, food & beverage), and consumer packaged goods. With ~8,000 employees across 150+ countries, it emphasizes recurring revenue from consumables (inks, chemicals), services (~40% of sales), and software/digital (~15-20% growth driver). FY2023 revenue was $2.9 billion, with high margins (adjusted operating margin ~26%). The company benefits from regulatory tailwinds like PFAS remediation and water quality standards, positioning it for resilient growth in a $100B+ addressable market.

Rationale: Resilient 4-6% CAGR through 2027 (above sector 3-4%); margin expansion potential; undervalued vs. peers (P/E 28x fwd vs. 30x+ Danaher legacy). Moderate risk: Industrial cyclicality offset by 50% recurring revenue, regs tailwinds. Recent beat/raise + dividend signal confidence.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $118** (15% upside from $102.84). DCF-based (7% perpetual growth, 9% WACC; verified analyst consensus ~$110-120 from Barclays/Goldman Oct 2024; growth portfolio fit with 10-15% annualized returns).

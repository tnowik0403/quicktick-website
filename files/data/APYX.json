Daily Volume**: 45,000 shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: ~11.4 million\n\n## Company Overview\nApyx Medical Corporation (APYX) is a commercial-stage energy-based medical device company specializing in helium plasma technology for aesthetic and surgical applications. Headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, the company develops, manufactures, and markets the Renuvion® platform, which uses proprietary helium plasma to deliver precise radiofrequency (RF) energy for tissue contraction, coagulation, and ablation. This technology enables minimally invasive procedures with reduced thermal damage compared to traditional lasers or RF devices.\n\nFounded in 2013 (formerly Bovie Medical), Apyx targets two primary markets: aesthetics (e.g., skin tightening post-liposuction) and advanced energy surgical procedures (e.g., precise cutting and hemostasis). Renuvion is FDA-cleared for general surgery, gynecology, and dermatology, with over 500,000 procedures performed globally. The company sells generators, handpieces, and disposables through a direct U.S. sales force and international distributors.\n\nIn FY2023, Apyx generated $29.4 million in revenue (verified Q4 2023 earnings, filed March 2024), primarily from disposables (recurring ~70% of sales). However, it faces challenges with stagnant growth amid economic pressures on elective aesthetics. With a lean team of ~100 employees, Apyx emphasizes clinical evidence (over 50 peer-reviewed studies) and surgeon training to drive adoption. The microcap stock trades at a steep discount to peers, reflecting execution risks but offering leveraged upside if Renuvion expands into high-volume indications.

Moderate risk appetite limits upside conviction.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $1.80 (60% upside) – DCF-based (8% discount rate, 15% CAGR post-2025, 4x terminal EV/Sales multiple aligned to microcaps). Assumes $35M 2026 rev; sensitivity: $1.20 (base), $3.00 (trial success). Not for growth portfolios without catalysts.",

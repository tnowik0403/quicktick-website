Existing Products/Services\n\nITT operates through three main business segments:\n\n**Motion Technologies ($1.4B revenue, ~4,000 employees):** manufactures brake components and specialized sealing solutions, shock absorbers and damping technologies primarily for the global automotive, truck and trailer, public bus and rail transportation markets. This segment manufactures brake pads, shock absorbers, energy absorption components, and damping technologies primarily for the transportation industry, including passenger cars, trucks, light and heavy-duty commercial and military vehicles, buses, and trains.\n\n**Industrial Process ($1.4B revenue, ~3,400 employees):** manufactures engineered fluid process equipment serving a diversified mix of customers in global industries such as chemical, energy, mining, and other industrial process markets and is a provider of plant optimization and efficiency solutions and aftermarket services and parts. IP is a global leader in centrifugal and twin-screw pumps and engineered valves with ~$1.4 billion in revenue in 2024. This segment sells its products under the Goulds Pumps, Bornemann, Engineered Valves, Hamworthy Pumps, PRO Services, C'treat, i-ALERT, Svanehøj, Rheinhütte Pumpen, and Habonim brand names.\n\n**Connect & Control Technologies ($0.8B revenue, ~3,800 employees):** manufactures harsh-environment connector solutions, critical energy absorption, flow control components, and composite materials for the aerospace and defense, general industrial, medical, and energy markets. This segment offers engineered connectors and specialized products for critical applications supporting various markets, including aerospace and defence, industrial, transportation, medical, and energy under the Cannon, VEAM, BIW Connector Systems, Aerospace Controls, Enidine, Compact Automation, Neo-Dyn Process Controls, Conoflow, kSARIA, and Micro-Mode brand names.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nITT is advancing several major innovation initiatives:\n\n**VIDAR Industrial Smart Motor:** This revolutionary technology addresses a significant market inefficiency: nearly 10% of global electricity powers industrial pumps and fans, translating to an annual energy bill exceeding $300 billion. VIDAR embeds variable speed technology directly into the motor, offering substantial energy savings and emission reductions. Unlike traditional variable speed drives that require considerable space and clean room environments, VIDAR is a \"drop-in replacement\" for existing motors, simplifying installation and accelerating payback. At one pilot site, a single VIDAR motor reduced motor speed by 24%, decreased energy use by over 50%, and lowered noise levels, all while maintaining the same flow at half the operating cost. This translated to annual savings of approximately $20,000 for the plant and eliminated 160 metric tons of CO2 emissions. ITT is targeting $150 million in VIDAR sales by 2030 and aims for a 10% market share in this new $6 billion addressable market.\n\n**Geo-Pad Brake Technology:** The Geo-Pad, a breakthrough material science in brake pads, is currently undergoing testing with a large European OEM, moving closer to commercialization.\n\n**Advanced Defense Platforms:** The Connect & Control Technologies segment benefits from a new product development team that co-designs and rapidly prototypes connectors for harsh environments, driving new awards and market share gains on advanced defense platforms.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nITT's growth strategy is built on three pillars: execution, innovation, and M&A. Their differentiation – which has powered a total shareholder return of 45% from 2021-2024 – is driven by their execution, innovation and now, M&A. A combination of organic growth and margin expansion, along with an anticipated $500 to $700 million per year towards highly strategic acquisitions, are expected to drive the next chapter of value creation at ITT. \n\nIn May 2025, they held their latest Capital Markets Day and announced new 2030 long-term financial targets. The company's strategy involves strategically transforming into a higher-growth, higher-margin enterprise through disciplined M&A, continuous technological innovation, and robust operational execution, driving consistent outperformance in specialized markets.\n\n## 6.

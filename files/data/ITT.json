Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Stamford, CT, the company operates through three main segments: Industrial Process (IP, ~42% of 2023 revenue), which provides pumps, valves, and heat transfer equipment for chemical, oil & gas, mining, and water applications; Motion Technologies (MT, ~39%), focused on automotive brake pads, fluid seals, and wiper systems; and Connect & Control Technologies (CCT, ~19%), offering connectors, fasteners, and actuation systems for aerospace. With ~10,100 employees and operations in 35 countries, ITT generated $3.8 billion in 2023 revenue, emphasizing aftermarket services (50%+ of IP revenue), innovation in sustainability (e.g., low-emission pumps), and operational efficiency via the ITT ACE operating model. The company benefits from recurring revenue streams, strong margins (2023 adj. operating margin 17.7%), and a focus on megatrends like electrification, decarbonization, and infrastructure spending. Recent online discussions (e.g., Reddit r/stocks, Seeking Alpha forums) highlight ITT's resilience amid industrial cycles, with praise for margin expansion and acquisition integration, though some note automotive exposure risks.

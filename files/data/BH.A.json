(BH.A) is a diversified holding company controlled by CEO and Chairman Sardar Biglari, focusing on two primary segments: Restaurants (Steak n Shake) and Insurance (Southern Pioneer Insurance Co. - SPIC and First Guard Insurance Co. - FGIC). Steak n Shake operates ~380 company-owned and franchised casual dining locations across 20+ U.S. states, specializing in steakburgers, thin-cut fries, and milkshakes, with a franchising pivot since 2018 to reduce footprint from 400+ owned stores. The insurance arms underwrite specialty property & casualty (P&C) coverage, primarily non-standard commercial auto for trucking fleets, with SPIC focusing on Texas and FGIC on national expansion. BH.A also holds minor assets like Gilley's entertainment venue. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30; reported Aug 8, 2024), the company generated consolidated revenues of $96.6 million (up 8.2% YoY), driven by insurance premium growth offsetting restaurant declines. Operating earnings were $3.2 million (vs. $1.1 million YoY), with insurance contributing ~70% of profits.

(EA) is a leading global interactive entertainment company headquartered in Redwood City, California, specializing in the development, marketing, publishing, and distribution of video games across multiple platforms including consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch), PC, and mobile devices. Founded in 1982, EA operates through a portfolio of blockbuster franchises such as EA SPORTS FC (formerly FIFA), Madden NFL, Apex Legends, The Sims, Battlefield, and Dragon Age, alongside live service titles and mobile games like The Sims Mobile and Plants vs. Zombies. The company generates revenue primarily from full-game sales (digital and physical), live services (in-game purchases, subscriptions), and licensing. In FY2025 (ended March 31, 2025), EA reported net revenue of $7.56B, with live services accounting for ~75% of bookings, reflecting a shift from traditional boxed sales to recurring revenue models. EA serves over 700M registered players worldwide, leveraging data analytics and cloud technology to enhance player engagement. The company invests heavily in proprietary engines like Frostbite and tools for cross-platform play. Recent strategic focuses include expanding into single-player narratives (e.g., Dragon Age: The Veilguard), esports, and emerging markets like mobile and cloud gaming. EA faces competition in a maturing gaming industry valued at ~$184B in 2025 (Newzoo), but benefits from strong IP ownership and a pivot to high-margin live ops amid macroeconomic pressures.

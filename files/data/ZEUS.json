(ZEUS) is a leading U.S.-based metals service center (MSC) specializing in the distribution and value-added processing of large volumes of steel and other metals. Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, the company procures hot-rolled, cold-rolled, coated, and galvanized carbon flat-rolled steel, as well as tubular products and specialty metals like stainless steel, nickel alloys, aluminum, and tool steels. ZEUS operates through three segments: Carbon Flat Products (76% of Q2 2024 sales, focusing on flat-rolled steel for automotive, appliances, and construction); Tubular and Pipe Products (16%, steel pipes/tubes for energy, plumbing, and agribusiness); and Specialty Metals Products (9%, premium alloys for aerospace, medical, and oil & gas). With 45 facilities across 15 states and ~1,800 employees, ZEUS serves a diverse customer base of ~5,000 manufacturers by slitting, cutting-to-length, tempering, and other processing services to reduce customer lead times and costs. The company emphasizes just-in-time delivery, inventory management, and relationships with major steel mills like U.S. Steel, Nucor, and Cleveland-Cliffs. In FY2023, ZEUS generated $2.0 billion in revenue amid steel price volatility, positioning it as a mid-tier MSC player in a fragmented $150+ billion U.S. market dominated by pricing cycles, tariffs, and end-market demand.

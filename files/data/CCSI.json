(CCSI) is a channel-centric provider of secure digital communication and workflow collaboration solutions, primarily serving regulated industries like healthcare, financial services, and legal sectors. Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the company enables businesses to send, receive, and manage mission-critical documents via cloud-based platforms, replacing legacy fax and EDI systems with secure, HIPAA-compliant alternatives. Its flagship offerings bridge traditional fax with modern digital workflows, supporting over 150,000 customers globally.\n\nCCSI's core value proposition is interoperability and security, allowing seamless integration with EHR/EMR systems, CRMs, and APIs for automated document exchange. Revenue is predominantly recurring (88% in recent quarter), driven by subscription-based models with high margins. The company operates through a partner ecosystem of over 5,000 resellers, MSPs, and ISVs, emphasizing channel-led growth over direct sales.

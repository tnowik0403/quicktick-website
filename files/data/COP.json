Growth Strategy\n\nLooking to 2026, the company expects lower capital and operating costs with flat to modest production growth. ConocoPhillips expects its four in-progress major projects and $1 billion cost reduction efforts to deliver $7 billion of free cash flow inflection by 2029, with $1 billion of improvement each year from 2026 through 2028, amounting to $3 billion by 2028, with the remaining $4 billion coming in 2029.\n\n**Key Strategic Initiatives:**\n- Aggressive integration strategy that will deliver more than $1 billion in run-rate synergies by the end of 2025 from the Marathon Oil acquisition, with over half already incorporated into the 2025 capital spending plan of $12.9 billion\n- Planned $10 billion return to shareholders in 2025 through dividends and share buybacks\n- On track to achieve a significant uplift in cash flow by the end of the decade, expecting to nearly double its annual free cash flow (FCF) by 2029, with a strong balance sheet and a breakeven price target in the low range per barrel of WTI\n\n## 6.

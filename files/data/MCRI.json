(MCRI) is a regional gaming and hospitality operator owning and operating two flagship properties: the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nevada (522 rooms, 1,400+ slots, 100+ tables), and the Monarch Casino Black Hawk in Black Hawk, Colorado (recently expanded to 1,563 slots, 44 tables, 750+ rooms post-Phase I). Founded in 1979, the company focuses on mid-tier gaming markets with loyal local and drive-in customer bases, emphasizing casino gaming (60-70% of revenue), hotel rooms, food & beverage (F&B), and ancillary services. Black Hawk, its growth engine, benefits from Colorado's table-game legalization and proximity to Denver (45-min drive), while Atlantis serves Reno's tourism and convention traffic. MCRI generates stable cash flows through owned real estate (no leases), with ~70% revenue from Colorado post-expansion. In FY2023 (ended Dec 31), it reported $480.8M revenue. The company avoids high-end Vegas competition, targeting value-oriented players amid sector consolidation.

(NASDAQ: LMB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Stock Price**: $68.50  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $785.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $30.82 - $98.91  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 25.4  \n- **EPS (TTM)**: $2.70  \n\n## Company Overview\nLimbach Holdings, Inc. (LMB) is a full-service building systems solutions company specializing in the design, engineering, construction, and maintenance of complex heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, electrical, automation, and life safety systems. Founded in 1901 and headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, Limbach operates primarily in the eastern and midwestern U.S., serving owners, general contractors, and construction managers across key end-markets including healthcare (hospitals and labs), data centers, education (universities and K-12), government facilities, and light industrial. The company derives revenue from two segments: General Operations (90%+ of revenue from new construction and renovations) and Other Operations (service, maintenance, and repairs). With a $857 million backlog as of Q2 2024, Limbach emphasizes high-margin service work (targeting 20-25% of revenue) and design-assist projects to differentiate from commoditized mechanical contracting. In FY2023, it generated $496.0 million in revenue (verified Q4 2023 earnings, filed Feb 28, 2024), focusing on backlog conversion efficiency (88.7% in Q2 2024) and organic growth amid a fragmented $120+ billion U.S. mechanical services market. Recent profitability surges stem from operational leverage, cost controls, and market tailwinds like data center expansion, positioning Limbach as a nimble mid-cap player with scalable expertise in mission-critical facilities.

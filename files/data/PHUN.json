(PHUN) is a mobile-first software company providing a fully-integrated Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform that enables enterprises to engage, manage, and monetize large audiences through mobile applications. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Phunware offers a suite of software development kits (SDKs) and services including location-based services, push notifications, content management, analytics, advertising, and loyalty programs. The platform supports white-label \"super apps\" for verticals like political campaigns, retail, healthcare, and hospitality, allowing clients to build customized apps without in-house development expertise.\n\nHistorically focused on enterprise mobility, Phunware has pivoted toward high-profile political and consumer apps. A key differentiator is its turnkey approach, reducing development time from months to weeks while integrating AI-driven personalization and geofencing for hyper-local marketing. Revenue streams include software licenses (SDK integrations), professional services (custom app builds), and monetization (ads, subscriptions). As of Q2 2024, Phunware reported serving over 1,000 customers historically, with a focus on scalable, recurring SaaS models amid a competitive mobile adtech landscape valued at $400B+ globally.\n\nThe company went public via SPAC in 2020 but faced post-merger challenges like dilution and losses. Recent momentum stems from high-visibility contracts, notably powering Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign app, positioning Phunware for potential breakout in political tech—a niche with sticky, high-margin contracts.

(ARE) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) focused exclusively on owning, operating, and developing high-quality properties in life science, technology, and agtech innovation clusters across the U.S. and select international markets. Headquartered in Pasadena, CA, ARE manages over 42.8 million RSF (rentable square feet) as of Q3 2024, concentrated in premier hubs like Greater Boston (Cambridge/Kendall Square), San Francisco Bay Area (South SF Bay), New York Tri-State (NYC Metro), Suburban Maryland/Metro DC, San Diego, Seattle, and emerging clusters like Research Triangle (NC). The company's portfolio emphasizes Class A/A+ lab/office campuses with mission-critical infrastructure for high-growth tenants in biotech, pharma, and tech R&D. ARE's strategy leverages strategic locations near top universities (e.g., MIT, Harvard, Stanford) and venture capital ecosystems to attract leading innovators. As the preeminent owner-operator in life science real estate, ARE benefits from high barriers to entry, sticky long-term leases (avg. 10+ years), and escalating demand for specialized lab space amid global advancements in drug discovery, gene therapy, and AI-driven biotech. Despite cyclical biotech funding pressures, ARE's $13.5B development pipeline positions it for outsized growth in a market projected to expand at 8-10% CAGR through 2030.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 30, 2024)**: Total revenues $794.9 million (+12.1% YoY); net income attributable to common stockholders $68.3 million; FFO as adjusted, per share-diluted $2.58 (+3.2% YoY); AFFO per share $2.70.

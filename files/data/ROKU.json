(ROKU) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Closing Price   | $65.30        |\n| Market Cap      | $9.24B        |\n| 52-Week Range   | $52.11 - $108.84 |\n| Avg.

(NASDAQ: ROKU) is a leading streaming platform provider that operates at the intersection of content publishers, distributors, and advertisers. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in San Jose, California, Roku delivers an integrated ecosystem including hardware (streaming sticks, players, and smart TVs), software (Roku OS powering over 80 million active accounts as of Q2 2024), and services (The Roku Channel, ad platform). The company monetizes through three segments: Platform (85%+ of revenue from ads, content deals, and audience reach), Devices (streaming hardware sales), and Other (NPDI from content licensing). Roku's neutral platform philosophy allows seamless integration of third-party apps like Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video, driving user engagement. As of Q2 2024 earnings (August 1, 2024), Roku reported 81.6 million streaming households (up 14% YoY), streaming hours up 22% to 29.5 billion, and platform revenue of $749.7 million (up 22% YoY). It holds a dominant position in the U.S. connected TV (CTV) market, benefiting from the shift to streaming amid cord-cutting. Internationally, expansion into UK, Canada, Latin America, and Europe fuels growth, though U.S. remains ~80% of revenue. Challenges include ad market cyclicality and Big Tech competition, but Roku's focus on user acquisition, ARPU expansion (up 12% YoY to $44.42 in Q2), and original content positions it for long-term dominance in a $300B+ global CTV ad market.

Rationale: Q2 beat/guidance exceeded expectations; CTV ad recovery underway; 20%+ growth potential undervalued at 2.8x EV/Sales vs. peers (5x+). Moderate risk from ad cyclicality offset by account momentum.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $85 (30% upside).

OBK provides a full suite of commercial and retail banking products, including deposits (checking, savings, CDs), loans (commercial & industrial [C&I], commercial real estate [CRE], residential mortgages, consumer), and fee-based services like mortgage banking, insurance agency operations, and a trust/wealth management division (Origin Wealth Management). With total assets of $14.7 billion as of September 30, 2024, OBK targets small- to middle-market businesses and high-net-worth individuals in growing Sun Belt markets. The bank's strategy leverages organic growth through de novo branches and selective M&A, while maintaining strong asset quality (non-performing assets at 0.37% of loans in Q3 2024) and a conservative balance sheet.

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG operates in approximately 70 countries with over 50,000 employees. The company generates revenue through two main segments: Performance Coatings (57% of 2023 sales, ~$9.0B), which includes automotive OEM/refinish, aerospace, and industrial coatings; and Industrial Coatings (43%, ~$6.8B), encompassing architectural coatings, protective marine/industrial coatings, and specialty products like flat glass and continuous-strand fiberglass. PPG serves diverse end-markets including automotive (e.g., powder coatings for EV batteries), aerospace (e.g., jet engine coatings), construction (architectural paints), and infrastructure (road markings). With a focus on sustainability—aiming for 50% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% recyclable packaging—PPG emphasizes innovation in low-VOC formulations and digital tools like color-matching apps. In 2023, total revenue was $18.0B, with strong margins driven by pricing discipline amid raw material volatility.

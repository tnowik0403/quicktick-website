This approach aims to drive sustainable organic growth and improve its financial performance.\n\nAt the core of PPG's enterprise growth strategy is a focus on markets where they hold leading positions and offer a differentiated portfolio of paints, coatings and surface solutions. In 2024, they further strengthened that focus and optimized their portfolio through the divestitures of both their silica products and their architectural coatings U.S. and Canada businesses.

As a result, PPG is a sharper, more focused company.\n\n**Innovation Investment:**\nPPG's commitment to research and development is a cornerstone of its growth strategy. In 2024, the company allocated a significant $574 million to R&D, representing approximately 3.1% of its net sales.\n\nA key aspect of PPG's innovation is its focus on sustainably advantaged solutions.

The company has a footprint in many regions around the globe, with less than half of sales coming from North America in recent years.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Full Year 2024 Results:**\nFull-year financials reflect architectural coatings U.S. and Canada as discontinued operations with net sales from continuing operations of $15.8 billion, reported EPS of $5.72 and adjusted EPS of $7.87, an increase of 6% year over year.\n\nRevenue: US$15.8b (down 2.4% from FY 2023). Net income: US$1.34b (up 9.9% from FY 2023). Profit margin: 8.5% (up from 7.5% in FY 2023). The increase in margin was driven by lower expenses.\n\n**Q3 2024 Performance:**\nRecord reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $2.00 and adjusted EPS of $2.13. Net sales of $4.6 billion; organic sales flat versus prior year. Segment margins improved 60 basis points year over year, marking eight consecutive quarters of margin expansion.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nThe company anticipates that adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2025 will be in the range of $7.75 to $8.05, which at the mid-point represents EPS growth of 7% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and a higher tax rate. This range is based on current global economic activity and foreign exchange rates, ongoing soft global industrial production, and mixed demand across the various regions in which we operate.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\nThe projected Q2 2025 EPS drop to $2.22 from $2.50 in Q2 2024 reflects broader macroeconomic pressures and uneven demand across PPG's segments. Revenue is also expected to fall 13.2% to $4.16 billion, driven by softness in the Global Architectural Coatings and Industrial Coatings divisions.\n\nPPG anticipates a slow start to 2025 as demand in Europe and in global industrial end-use markets remains challenged.\n\nGeopolitical risks include Mexico's delayed construction projects and European demand softness posing near-term threats. Currency volatility from emerging market currencies, particularly the peso, could continue to pressure margins. Industry cyclicality from weak automotive production in the U.S. and Europe (down mid-single digits) could constrain Industrial Coatings recovery.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nPPG's EcoGuard® low-VOC coatings and zero-waste manufacturing plants position it to capture 65% of the $12 billion green coatings market by 2026. Regulatory tailwinds like the EU's Revised Construction Products Regulation (2025) mandate energy-efficient building materials, directly benefiting PPG's insulation and window coating lines.\n\nProtective and marine coatings organic sales increased by a double-digit percentage compared to the prior year and achieved its 10th consecutive quarter of sales volume growth, including above-market marine sales volume growth in Asia Pacific. Traffic solutions benefited from its industry-best value proposition and strong demand across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nPPG expects to realize more than $100 million in annualized share gains in their Industrial Coatings segment beginning in the second half of the year.\n\n## 9.

Founded in 2002 by casino magnate Steve Wynn, the company owns and operates iconic properties including Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip (Nevada, USA), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau in Macau (China), and Encore Boston Harbor in Everett, Massachusetts (USA). These resorts feature premium casino gaming floors, luxury hotels with thousands of rooms, high-end spas, fine dining from Michelin-starred chefs, theaters for headline entertainment, retail boutiques, and convention spaces. Wynn emphasizes personalized service and opulent design, targeting ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) and affluent travelers.\n\nThe company's revenue is diversified across casino (primary driver, ~60-70%), rooms, food & beverage (F&B), and retail, with operations spanning regulated gaming markets in the US and Asia. Macau properties contribute ~50-60% of EBITDA, reflecting exposure to China's VIP gaming segment, while Las Vegas provides stable domestic cash flow. As of Q2 2024, Wynn reported record operating revenues of $1.69 billion, up 15% YoY, driven by Macau recovery and Las Vegas strength. The firm is expanding into new markets, notably the Middle East with the $3.9 billion Wynn Al Marjan Island project in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, slated for 2027 opening. Wynn's market cap stands at $7.97 billion with a current stock price of $72.45 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data). Challenges include Macau's regulatory overhang and geopolitical risks, but tailwinds from tourism rebound and non-gaming diversification position Wynn for mid-teens revenue growth through 2027.

UAE catalyst, Macau rebound, Las Vegas cash cow outweigh leverage risks for moderate-risk growth portfolios (15-20% annual upside potential).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $115/share (40% upside from $72.45). Based on 11x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($7.0B est., +12% growth), peers + UAE $400M add'l EBITDAR by 2027 (DCF model aligned with JPM/Barclays).

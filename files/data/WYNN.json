Expecting to contribute between US$25 million and US$50 million to the Janu Al Marjan Island project, Wynn said the development would be managed by the onsite Wynn Al Marjan Island team and should provide a further boost to earnings given the \"recent success of condo sales in the UAE\" and the high quality of resident it expects to snap up the opportunity.\n\n## 5.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**2024 Full Year Financial Results:**\nWynn Resorts has reported the company's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full-year (FY), with operating revenue having risen by 9.1% year-over-year during FY2024 for a total of $7.13bn and the company's net income decreasing by 31.4% to be just under $501.1m. The fall in net income may be primarily attributed to an increase of over $300m in operating expenses throughout FY2024, reported to cost Wynn Resorts nearly $6bn during the period, although operating income still managed to increase by 34.8% from the prior year period for a total of $1.13bn. Wynn Resorts did report an increase in both adjusted net income and adjusted property EBITDAR, reporting totals of $663.5m and $2.36bn, respectively, resulting in rises of 43.5% and 11.8% year-over-year. The company's casino segment was the primary driver of revenue during FY2024, accounting for nearly $4.3bn of the total revenue reported by Wynn Resorts and increasing 14.6% year-over-year.\n\n**Regional Performance Q4 2024:**\nWynn Macau was unable to report an increase in operating revenue during Q4 2024 despite showing growth over the FY, falling by 5.8% year-over-year for a reported total of $363.7m throughout the period. Encore Boston Harbor's operating revenue also fell during Q4 2024, decreasing by 2.1% from the prior year period to generate $212.7m. Wynn Palace and Las Vegas operations both showed increases in operating revenue throughout the fourth quarter of 2024, reporting totals of $562.9m and $699.5m, respectively, for rises of 7.4% and 0.4% year-over-year.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Wynn anticipates the UAE may eventually host three integrated resorts, collectively generating an estimated US$3 billion to US$5 billion in annual GGR. The company's modeling assumes that even a modest penetration of the regional market—0.04% of the 2.4 billion people within a four-hour flight—could translate into frequent travel, with an expected 2.8 to 3.1 annual trips per visitor.\n- It's expected not only to be a pioneering integrated gaming resort in MENA but also remain singularly unique for some time within this emerging market landscape. The head of the UAE's General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), Jim Murren, emphasised that there would not be an influx of other casino operators into the market anytime soon. He indicated that while additional licences may emerge over time — potentially within five to 10 years — the focus remains firmly on Wynn for now. With only one casino licence issued so far in the UAE, contextually tied to Wynn Al Marjan Island's development plans, it positions the company at a distinct advantage as it pioneers casino gaming in the region.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Heavy reliance on a single market. Exposure to regulatory changes. SWOT Insights: Strengths include brand reputation and financial stability, while weaknesses involve high operating costs and regulatory risks. Opportunities lie in digital gaming and new markets, with threats from economic downturns and competition.\n- U.S. and/or global economies, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political conditions, adverse tourism trends, travel disruptions caused by events outside of our control, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction and regulatory risks associated with current and future projects (including Wynn Al Marjan Island), cybersecurity risk and our leverage and ability to meet our debt service obligations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Macau Market:**\nIn Macau, the battle for market share is particularly intense, with Las Vegas Sands holding over 22% of the market. MGM Resorts, with its 56% stake in MGM China, presents a formidable challenge both in Asia and on the domestic Las Vegas Strip.\n\nMacau properties (Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace) delivered an estimated 50–60% of consolidated revenue in 2024 and an outsized share of Adjusted Property EBITDA due to premium-mass margins. Company revenue moved from roughly $6.5 billion in 2023 toward approximately $7.5–8.0 billion in 2024, with Adjusted Property EBITDA above $2.0 billion.\n\n**Las Vegas Market:**\nMGM Resorts is the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip with 37,000 guest rooms and suites, representing about one fourth of all units in the market. The Strip contributed approximately 59% of total EBITDAR in 2024.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nWynn Resorts competitors include MGM Resorts International, Las Vegas Sands, Station Casinos, and Caesars Entertainment.\n\nWynn Resorts operates within a fiercely competitive global casino industry, facing off against integrated resort behemoths and niche luxury players. Its most significant direct competitors are Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International, with all three vying for the loyalty of the world's highest-stakes gamblers.\n\nWynn Resorts maintains a formidable competitive edge through its unparalleled brand equity and operational excellence in the luxury casino resort sector. Its properties in Macau and on the Las Vegas Strip are masterclasses in integrated resort design, generating industry-leading profitability with property EBITDA margins reaching\n\nWynn Resorts is known for its luxury and high-quality service, but faces competition from companies like Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts, which have broader geographic diversification and lower operating costs.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Crown London Acquisition (2025):**\nWynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN) announced that it completed the purchase of Wynn Mayfair from Crown Resorts, having received the required approval from the UK Gambling Commission. The prestigious Mayfair casino location expands Wynn's footprint in Europe and the Middle East ahead of Wynn Al Marjan Island resort opening in the UAE in early 2027.\n\nWynn Resorts CEO Craig Billings said, \"This acquisition of an iconic asset offers us a presence in a global gateway city and will create a conduit for Wynn guests to visit our resorts, particularly Wynn Al Marjan Island which is slated to open in the first quarter of 2027 in Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates.\"\n\n**UAE Partnership:**\nWynn Resorts is developing the project in partnership with Marjan and RAK Hospitality Holding, creating a new category of luxury in the region.\n\nThe U.S.-based gaming operator – the parent of Macau casino concessionaire Wynn Macau Ltd – has a 40-percent stake in the project.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**CEO Leadership:**\nOn November 9, 2021, Wynn announced that Matthew Maddox would be stepping down as CEO on January 31, 2022. Craig Billings was named as successor to Maddox. Billings assumed the role of CEO effective February 1, 2022.\n\n**Major Shareholder Change:**\nTilman Fertitta, the billionaire investor and majority owner of Fertitta Entertainment, has significantly increased his investment in Wynn Resorts Ltd. The Texas-based mogul recently purchased shares worth $27.87 million, further consolidating his position as the largest individual shareholder in the luxury casino and hospitality giant. This brings his total holdings in Wynn Resorts to 13 million shares, reinforcing his status as the largest stakeholder in the company. The timing of these acquisitions appears to be strategic, with Wynn's stock price hovering near a 52-week low of $66.20.\n\n**UAE Project Progress:**\nBillings also revealed that concrete is being poured for the final two floors of Wynn Al Marjan Island with top out of the tower expected by December.\n\nUpon completion, Wynn Al Marjan Island will feature 1,542 rooms and suites. To date, structural work has been finalised for around 1,121 guest rooms — 73% of the overall target — with fit-out processes already underway in around 820 rooms.\n\n## 13.

It operates primarily through its banking subsidiaries, Tompkins Trust Company (New York) and Tompkins Financial Corporation's BankTompkins (Pennsylvania), offering a full suite of retail and commercial banking products, including deposit accounts, consumer and business loans, mortgages, and cash management services. The company also provides wealth management, financial planning, and insurance brokerage via Tompkins Financial Advisors and Tompkins Insurance Agencies. With approximately $15.3 billion in assets as of Q2 2024 (per July 25, 2024 earnings release), TMP serves individuals, small-to-medium businesses, municipalities, and nonprofits across upstate New York, central Pennsylvania, and select Massachusetts markets. \n\nTompkins emphasizes community banking with a relationship-focused model, differentiating through personalized service and local decision-making. It has pursued growth via strategic acquisitions and organic expansion, maintaining a conservative balance sheet with strong capital ratios (CET1 ratio of 11.7% as of Q2 2024). Recent challenges include net interest margin (NIM) compression from higher deposit costs amid elevated rates, but the firm benefits from a deposit-heavy funding mix (65% low-cost core deposits). Employee-owned structure fosters long-term alignment. Online discussions (e.g., Seeking Alpha, October 2024) highlight TMP's resilience in a volatile regional banking sector, with analysts noting its CRE exposure (primarily office and multifamily) at ~200% of risk-based capital as manageable compared to peers.\n\n(Word count: 248)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (October 24, 2024 release)**: Net income $12.8 million, diluted EPS $1.18 (down from $1.32 YoY due to higher provisions for credit losses).

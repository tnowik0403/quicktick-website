(NASDAQ: INGN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $7.82 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $457.2 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $5.45 - $17.62  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nInogen, Inc. is a leading global medical technology company specializing in the design, manufacture, and marketing of portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) for patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD, which affects over 16 million Americans. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Goleta, California, Inogen's mission is to \"make freedom central to every oxygen patient's life\" by providing lightweight, battery-powered devices that deliver oxygen therapy on-the-go, eliminating the need for heavy oxygen tanks. The company operates through two segments: Home Healthcare (direct-to-consumer and business-to-business sales via distributors) and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC rentals and sales). Inogen's products dominate the ambulatory oxygen therapy market, with over 1 million units shipped since inception. Revenue is generated primarily from U.S. sales (80%+), supplemented by international growth in Europe and Asia. As of Q2 2024, Inogen reported $75.3 million in quarterly revenue (up 5% YoY), but faces challenges from Medicare reimbursement pressures and payer mix shifts. With a focus on innovation and e-commerce, Inogen aims to capture share in the $3-4 billion global oxygen therapy market amid aging populations and rising respiratory diagnoses.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024):** Revenue $75.3M (+5% YoY), gross margin 50.6%, net loss $10.7M or ($0.86) EPS.

Weak guidance, reimbursement risks, and sequential declines outweigh international tailwinds; limited near-term catalysts despite undervalued EV/Sales (1.2x vs. peers 2x).\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $12.00 (55% upside for growth portfolio, moderate risk). Based on 2025E revenue $320M, 10% EBITDA margin ($32M), 14x EV/EBITDA multiple (peer avg.); DCF implies $10-14 range assuming 5% CAGR. Hold for turnaround; buy below $7.",

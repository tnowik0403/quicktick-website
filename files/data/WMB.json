(WMB) is a leading North American natural gas infrastructure company, primarily operating in the midstream sector. Founded in 1908 and headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, WMB owns and operates one of the largest natural gas pipeline networks in the U.S., spanning approximately 30,000 miles of pipelines that transport over one-third of U.S. natural gas production. The company is divided into three main segments: Transmission & Gulf of America (TGA), which includes interstate pipelines like Transco (the largest U.S. gas transporter serving Northeast demand); West, focusing on Rocky Mountain processing and pipelines; and Gas & NGL Marketing Services (GNGS), handling fractionation and marketing of natural gas liquids (NGLs).\n\nWMB plays a critical role in the energy transition by enabling natural gas delivery to power plants, LNG export facilities, and emerging data centers. With 13 processing plants and 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of capacity, it processes significant volumes from prolific basins like the Permian and Haynesville. The company generates stable fee-based revenues (92% of total in recent quarters), insulated from commodity volatility, and benefits from long-term contracts (average 10+ years). As of Q2 2024 earnings (reported July 31, 2024), WMB reported Adjusted EBITDA of $2.00 billion (up 5% YoY) and Available Funds from Operations (AFFO) of $1.45 billion ($1.22/share), affirming 2024 guidance of $7.45-$7.85 billion EBITDA. WMB's strategic expansions position it for LNG export growth and AI-driven power demand, supporting a transition from coal/gas switching.

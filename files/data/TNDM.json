(NASDAQ: TNDM) is a medical technology company specializing in advanced insulin delivery systems for people with diabetes, particularly type 1 and insulin-dependent type 2 patients. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, Tandem designs, develops, and sells connected insulin pumps that integrate with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for automated insulin delivery (AID). Its flagship product, the t:slim X2 insulin pump, is the smallest dual-chamber waterproof pump available, supporting up to 720 units of insulin and integrating with Dexcom G6/G7 CGMs via the proprietary Control-IQ algorithm for predictive adjustments. Tandem's ecosystem includes the t:connect digital health platform for data analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based insights, serving over 500,000 users globally. The company operates in the $5B+ U.S. insulin pump market (part of the $100B+ global diabetes device sector), emphasizing user-friendly, tubed pumps with robust software interoperability. Tandem generates ~90% revenue from North America, with international expansion via CE-marked products in Europe and Australia. In Q2 2024, it reported record pump shipments and revenue growth driven by AID adoption, positioning it as a leader in hybrid closed-loop systems amid rising diabetes prevalence (1 in 10 U.S. adults). Challenges include competition from tubeless alternatives, but tailwinds from CGM advancements support its tech-forward strategy.

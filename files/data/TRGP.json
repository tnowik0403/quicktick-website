Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Major Growth Projects:**\nIncluding the Yeti plant, Targa is constructing five gas processing plants in the Permian that will be online over the next two years, with an aggregate inlet capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (\"Bcf/d\") and estimated NGL production of ~175 to 200 MBbl/d.\n\n**Speedway NGL Pipeline:**\nSpeedway will transport NGLs from Targa's existing assets and future plant additions, including a new processing plant recently announced, in the Permian Basin to the company's fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The project consists of about 500 miles of 30-in. diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure with an initial capacity of about 500,000 bpd, expandable to 1 million bpd. Speedway is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2027 at an estimated cost of approximately $1.6 billion.\n\n**Processing Plants Under Construction:**\n275-MMcfd East Pembrook plant in Midland basin, which is due for startup in second-quarter 2026. Midland basin-based 275-MMcfd East Driver plant slated for commissioning in third-quarter 2026. 275-MMcfd Bull Moose II plant in Delaware basin targeted for operation in fourth-quarter 2025.

Growth Strategy\n\nOur conviction is supported by multiple factors, including the bottom-up forecast from our existing producer customers, our continued commercial success, and the continued industry trend of rising gas-to-oil ratios. We have a lot of projects in progress, which means growth capital is elevated in 2025 and 2026, and these attractive investments will drive significant increases in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nOur chunkier downstream projects are set to come online in 2027. Both the Speedway NGL line and our larger LPG export expansion have sufficient capacity to handle our growing volumes for many years. Once these projects are online, we expect our downstream capital spending will be significantly lower for years to come, driving a substantial increase in free cash flow.\n\nThese new agreements in the Delaware are illustrative of meaningful wins in 2024; Targa also added multiple other packages across the Delaware and Midland in 2024 which added significant acreage to our footprint\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThree large deals in the Delaware illustrate Targa's overall strong customer value proposition The company serves various producer customers across major shale plays including the Permian Basin, with long-term, fee-based contracts across approximately 170,000 dedicated acres underpinned by attractive acreage with activity that has exhibited very low decline rates, supporting a durable volume profile.\n\nIt is also involved in the purchase and resale of NGL products; and sale of propane, as well as provision of related logistics services to multi-state retailers, independent retailers, and other end-users. In addition, the company offers NGL balancing services; and transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies in the Gulf Coast area\n\n## 7.

Adjusted EBITDA rose 10% sequentially.\n\nTarga Resources Corp (TRGP, Financial) reported a net income of $478.4 million for Q3 2025, a notable increase from $387.4 million in the same quarter of 2024.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nManagement now expects to reach the top end of the $4.65 billion to $4.85 billion range for full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA.\n\n**Dividend Information:**\nPlans to recommend a 25% increase in the annual common dividend to $5.00 per share in 2026.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• Expansion in natural gas infrastructure and export capabilities positions the company to capitalize on global demand and drive sustained revenue and margin growth.\n• Resilient cash flows from stable contracts and shareholder-focused capital strategies support financial strength and potential undervaluation relative to fundamentals.\n• The US is going big into the LNG exporting business in the next few years, and any company that can move that along is going to make money. The technicals still look strong to go higher, but right now the future fundamentals look even more compelling.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• While largely fee-based, the company is still exposed to commodity price volatility influencing producer activity.\n• For the broader midstream sector, regulatory hurdles and permitting delays for new infrastructure remain significant obstacles.\n• Aging infrastructure requires continuous capital investment for maintenance and upgrades, diverting funds from growth projects.\n• The long-term shift towards lower-carbon energy sources also presents a fundamental challenge, even as natural gas plays a transitional role, requiring strategic adaptation and investment in new technologies.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTarga, a midstream energy infrastructure corporation, is one of the largest infrastructure companies delivering natural gas and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company's robust operational capabilities, particularly its leading presence in the Permian Basin and at the Mont Belvieu NGL hub, position it as a formidable force.\n\nOur NGL Network Model shows DCP Midstream's (DCP) Sand Hills and ONEOK's (OKE) West TX LPG pipelines are set to lose ~80 Mb/d and ~60 Mb/d of Y-grade volumes from TRGP plants through 2024. This indicates Targa is gaining market share from competitors in NGL transportation.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nAmong Targa's key competitors are industry giants such as Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE: WMB), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE), and Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET).\n\nIn the natural gas processing segment, Targa competes directly with ONEOK and Energy Transfer, particularly in the Permian Basin where all three companies have significant operations. The competition centers on processing capacity, geographic positioning, and the ability to provide integrated services from wellhead to market. Enterprise Products Partners represents the largest competitor in NGL fractionation and transportation, with extensive Gulf Coast infrastructure that competes with Targa's Mont Belvieu operations.\n\nWilliams' shares were down about 2% at 10:28 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of roughly $54 billion. Targa's stock was also down 2%, giving it a market capitalization of $32 billion.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity:**\nannounced today that it has closed the previously announced acquisition of Stakeholder Midstream, LLC for $1.25 billion in cash. The acquisition has an effective date of January 1, 2026.\n\nStakeholder provides natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services and crude gathering and storage services in the Permian Basin, including approximately 480 miles of natural gas pipelines, approximately 180 million cubic feet per day (\"MMcf/d\") of cryogenic natural gas processing and sour treating capacity, carbon capture (\"CCUS\") activities generating 45Q tax credits, and a small crude oil gathering system.\n\nThe purchase price represents ~6x estimated 2026 unlevered adjusted free cash flow; Stakeholder is expected to generate ~$200 million of annual unlevered adjusted free cash flow with minimal capital needs.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nFor instance, Targa has partnered with MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) and WhiteWater Midstream on the bi-directional Traverse natural gas pipeline system, and even with Enbridge Inc. (NYSE: ENB), demonstrating instances where companies can be both competitors and collaborators.\n\n**Previous M&A Interest:**\nTarga Resources Corp. rebuffed informal takeover interest from larger rival Williams Cos. in recent months, people with knowledge of the matter said, in another signal of the sustained appetite for consolidation in the pipeline industry. The Houston-based natural gas pipeline operator viewed the overture from Williams as undervaluing the company\n\n## 12.

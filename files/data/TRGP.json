(TRGP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024 (All data sourced from real-time web searches via Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site targaresources.com, Edgar SEC filings, Reuters, and earnings transcripts from Motley Fool/AlphaStreet as of this date.)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nTarga Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) is a leading independent midstream energy company primarily focused on the gathering, processing, transportation, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Targa operates a vertically integrated asset base spanning key U.S. production basins, including the Permian Basin (Delaware and Midland sub-basins), Eagle Ford Shale, Bakken/Williston Basin, and Barnett Shale. The company processes over 10 Bcf/d of natural gas and fractionates ~1.1 MMBbl/d of NGLs, with major infrastructure like the ~1,000-mile intrastate pipelines in Texas and export terminals. Targa's Gathering & Processing (G&P) segment handles inlet gas, while the Coastal & NGLs segment manages logistics, fractionation at Mont Belvieu (world's largest NGL hub), and exports. In Q2 2024 earnings (July 30, 2024), Targa reported record volumes driven by Permian growth. The company benefits from long-term, fee-based contracts (~90% of EBITDA), insulating it from commodity volatility, while pursuing organic growth via ~$2.5B annual capex (2024 guidance). With a market cap emphasizing scale in NGLs amid LNG export boom, Targa positions as a pure-play midstream growth story in the energy transition.\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024 close):**\n| Metric | Value | Source |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Stock Price | $146.44 | Yahoo Finance/Google Finance |\n| Market Cap | $32.17B | Yahoo Finance |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $171.82 / $81.02 | Yahoo Finance |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | 27.4x | Yahoo Finance |\n| Dividend Yield | 1.4% ($2.40 annualized) | Nasdaq.com |\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 30, 2024)**: Record adjusted EBITDA of $1.10B (up 30% YoY); consolidated revenue $3.94B; distributable cash flow $975M.

Overall midstream consolidation favors Targa (volumes +10-15% CAGR).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or LTM) | TRGP | EPD (Enterprise) | ET (Energy Transfer) | MPLX |\n|-------------------------|------|-------------------|-----------------------|------|\n| Adj.

Potential: Golden Pass LNG (Exxon/Qatar) ramp-up boosts exports.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Committed to net-zero Scope 1/2 by 2030; methane intensity <0.2% (2023 sustainability report).\n- **Management**: CEO Jim Hertz (since 2020) track record of 25% CAGR EBITDA; insider ownership 1.5%.\n- **Online Sentiment**: Bullish on X/StockTwits (Oct 2024: \"Permian beast\" themes); analyst consensus Buy (17 Buys/3 Holds; avg PT $158 – Yahoo Oct 10).\n- **Risks**: 70% Permian exposure vulnerable to basin slowdown; FCF coverage 1.6x distributions.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy – Buy)**: High growth upside from Permian/NGL projects (15%+ EBITDA CAGR), undervalued vs. peers on growth-adjusted multiples, moderate risk via fee-based model. Momentum intact post-Q2 beat; tailwinds from LNG outweigh oil volatility.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $165** (13% upside from $146.44). DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; $5B 2026 EBITDA) aligned with analyst PTs (Barclays $170 Oct 9; JPM $162). Ideal for growth portfolios; hold if risk-averse on energy cycle.",

(NYSE: MIR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $11.82\n- Market Capitalization: $2.68 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $6.87 - $13.42\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 1.84 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nMirion Technologies, Inc. (MIR) is a global leader in radiation detection, measurement, analysis, and monitoring technologies, serving mission-critical applications in nuclear energy, medical imaging, defense, and industrial sectors. Founded in 2018 through a carve-out from Leidos and subsequent acquisitions, the company operates in two primary segments: Medical (scintillators, detectors for PET/SPECT imaging, dose monitoring) and Technologies (Detection Systems for nuclear security/response; Inspection for NDT/ultrasonics; Medical for imaging components). With ~3,000 employees across 20+ countries, Mirion generates revenue from hardware (scanners, dosimeters), software/services, and aftermarket support. In FY2023, it reported $970M revenue, driven by nuclear power plant upgrades and defense contracts amid global energy transition and geopolitical tensions. The company benefits from recurring revenue (~40% from services/spares) and exposure to secular tailwinds like small modular reactors (SMRs) and rising nuclear security needs, positioning it as a pure-play enabler in the ~$10B radiation detection market.

Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Major Competitors:**\n• **Kazatomprom**: The world's largest uranium producer (Kazakhstan)\n• **Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)**: Uranium Energy has a combined 12.1 million pounds of US-licensed uranium production capacity from three central processing plants.\n• **Centrus Energy (LEU)**: Centrus is one of the few U.S. companies licensed to sell low-enriched uranium (LEU), the fuel used in most commercial nuclear reactors. It's also the only publicly listed U.S. company that produces high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for advanced nuclear reactors.\n• **Denison Mines Corp**: Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin, holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nHowever, Cameco's leading position in the uranium mining market, the future growth of its laser-powered uranium enrichment services, and its stake in Westinghouse all make it a more balanced play on the nuclear market than Centrus. Cameco is also much larger than Centrus, yet it's growing faster and trades at a lower forward price-to-earnings ratio.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Westinghouse Acquisition (2022):**\nIn October 2022, Cameco along with Brookfield Renewable Partners announced the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Company in a US$7.9 billion deal including debt. Brookfield and Cameco formed a strategic partnership to acquire Westinghouse in October 2022.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\n• **Global Laser Enrichment (GLE)**: Cameco also holds a 49% stake in Global Laser Enrichment (GLE), its uranium enrichment joint venture with Silex.\n• **Inkai Joint Venture**: Cameco owns a 40% share in Joint Venture Inkai's in situ recovery uranium mine in south central Kazakhstan. The remaining 60% belongs to Kazatomprom, majority-owned by the government of Kazakhstan.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**$80 Billion US Government Partnership (October 2025):**\nCameco (TSX: CCO) (NYSE: CCJ) surged on Tuesday after the US government announced a strategic partnership with Westinghouse Electric Company, which it co-owns with Brookfield Asset Management, to accelerate the development of America's nuclear power. Washington envisions that at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors will be constructed across the country, using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology. Once constructed, the reactors will generate reliable and secure power, including for significant data center and compute capacity that will drive America's growth in AI.\n\n**Profit-Sharing Structure:**\nUnder the new strategic partnership, the US Government will be granted a participation interest (Participation Interest), which, once vested, will entitle it to receive 20% of any cash distributions in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse after the granting of the Participation Interest.\n\n**Production Updates (2025):**\n• Development delays in transitioning the McArthur River mine to new mining areas are expected to defer the extraction of pounds planned in 2025 and therefore impact our 2025 production forecast.\n• However, strong performance at the Cigar Lake mine provides an opportunity to partially offset the deferred McArthur River production. At the Cigar Lake mine, we continue to expect to produce 18 million pounds U3O8 (100% basis; 9.8 million pounds our share) this year, however performance to date at Cigar Lake has been strong, creating an opportunity to potentially offset up to 1 million pounds (100% basis) of the shortfall at the McArthur River/Key Lake operation.\n\n**Market Price Performance:**\nCameco's US-listed shares jumped more than 20% to an all-time high of $104.75 apiece on the news, taking the Canadian uranium producer's market capitalization to $45.3 billion.\n\n## 12.

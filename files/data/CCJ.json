Our competitive position is based on our controlling ownership of the world's largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations, as well as significant investments across the nuclear fuel cycle, including ownership interests in Westinghouse Electric Company and Global Laser Enrichment. Utilities around the world rely on Cameco to provide global nuclear fuel solutions for the generation of safe, reliable, carbon-free nuclear power.\n\n**Key Investment Highlights:**\n- $80 billion transformational partnership with US Government for nuclear reactor construction\n- Strong Q1 2025 performance: $789M revenue (+24%), $70M net earnings\n- Contract portfolio totals approximately 220 million pounds of uranium\n- Cameco maintains approximately 22% global uranium market share\n\n---\n\n## **COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nCameco operates through three segments: Uranium, Fuel Services, and Westinghouse. The Uranium segment engages in the exploration for, mining, milling, purchase, and sale of uranium concentrate. The Fuel Services segment is involved in the refining, conversion, and fabrication of uranium concentrate, as well as purchase and sale of conversion services. The Westinghouse segment operates as a nuclear reactor technology original equipment manufacturer and a provider of products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies. \n\nThe company sells its uranium and fuel products and services to nuclear utilities in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Cameco Corporation was incorporated in 1987 and is based in Saskatoon, Canada.\n\n---\n\n## **RECENT DEVELOPMENTS & STRATEGIC MILESTONES**\n\n### **Game-Changing US Government Partnership (October 2025)**\n\nThe agreement provides for the US Government to arrange financing and facilitate the permitting and approvals for new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the US, with an aggregate investment value of at least US$80 billion. For the Participation Interest to vest, the US Government must make a final investment decision and enter into definitive agreements to complete the construction of new Westinghouse nuclear reactors in the US with an aggregate value of at least US$80 billion.\n\nUnder the new strategic partnership, the US Government will be granted a participation interest which, once vested, will entitle it to receive 20% of any cash distributions in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse after the granting of the Participation Interest.\n\n### **Strong Financial Performance (2024-2025)**\n\nCameco reported its 2024 financial results, showing strong performance across uranium and Westinghouse segments. Annual net earnings were $172 million, with adjusted net earnings of $292 million. The company generated $905 million in cash from operations, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by 73% to over $1.5 billion compared to 2023.\n\nKey operational highlights include record uranium production at McArthur River/Key Lake of 20.3 million pounds, and total uranium deliveries of 33.6 million pounds at an average price of $79.70 per pound.\n\n### **Executive Leadership Transition**\n\nThe company maintains its 2025 production target of 18 million pounds at both McArthur River/Key Lake and Cigar Lake operations, while announcing executive team changes effective September 1, 2025, including Grant Isaac's appointment as president and COO.\n\n---\n\n## **OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE & PRODUCTION TARGETS**\n\n### **Uranium Production**\n\n| **Facility** | **2025 Target (Million lbs)** | **Status** |\n|--------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| McArthur River/Key Lake | 18.0 | On track to produce 18 million pounds (100% basis) |\n| Cigar Lake | 18.0 | On track to produce 18 million pounds (100% basis) |\n| JV Inkai | 8.3 | JV Inkai continues to target 2025 production of 8.3 million pounds (100% basis) of uranium of which our purchase allocation is expected to be 3.7 million pounds |\n\n### **Fuel Services Division**\n\nAt our Fuel Services division, our annual production expectation, which includes UF6 conversion, UO2 conversion, and heavy water reactor fuel bundles, remains between 13 million and 14 million kgU.\n\nFuel services revenues are projected at CAD 500–550 million in 2025, supported by sales deliveries of 13–14 million kgU. The segment's revenues were CAD 459 million from the delivery of 12.1 million kgU in 2024.\n\n---\n\n## **GROWTH STRATEGY & MARKET POSITIONING**\n\n### **Long-Term Contracting Strategy**\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, in our uranium segment, we had commitments to deliver an average of about 28 million pounds of uranium per year from 2025 through 2029, with commitment levels higher than the average in 2025 through 2027, and lower than the average in 2028 and 2029. Our total portfolio of long-term contracts includes commitments for approximately 220 million pounds of uranium.\n\nOur focus continues to be on obtaining market-related pricing mechanisms that benefit from a constructive price environment, while also providing adequate downside protection. In addition, with strong demand in the UF6 conversion market, we were successful in adding new long-term contracts that bring our total contracted volumes to over 85 million kgU of UF6.\n\n### **Revenue Growth Outlook**\n\nBacked by momentum in both segments, Cameco envisions 2025 total revenues at CAD 3.3-3.55 billion. If achieved, this would represent a CAGR of 30.8% (at the midpoint) over the 2021-2025 period.\n\n---\n\n## **MARKET SHARE & COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**\n\n### **Global Uranium Market Leaders**\n\n| **Company** | **Market Share** | **Key Assets/Notes** |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| **Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan)** | ~40% global production | As the world's largest producer—controlling more than 40% of global uranium production |\n| **Cameco (Canada)** | ~22% | Kazatomprom dominates global uranium production with approximately 22% market share |\n| **Orano (France)** | ~8-10% | Orano operates uranium mines across Niger, Canada and Kazakhstan while providing enrichment, conversion and recycling services.

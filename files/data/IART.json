Founded in 1989 and public since 1992, the company operates through two main segments: Codman Specialty Surgical (CSS) and Tissue Technologies (TT). CSS focuses on innovative devices for brain and spine surgery, including intracranial monitoring systems, shunts, dural repair products (e.g., DuraGen), and neuro critical care tools. TT provides regenerative tissue technologies for wound care and surgical reconstruction, such as acellular dermal matrices (e.g., PriMatrix, SurgiMend) and bioactive agents for burns, trauma, and chronic wounds.\n\nIntegra serves over 7,000 customers worldwide, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and clinicians, with ~70% of revenue from the U.S. and a growing international presence in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company emphasizes minimally invasive techniques, biologics, and digital integration to improve surgical outcomes. In FY2023, it generated $1.56B in revenue, but recent challenges have impacted growth. Integra's portfolio bridges tissue repair and device innovation, positioning it in high-growth medtech markets projected to expand at 5-7% CAGR through 2030, though execution risks persist amid regulatory scrutiny.

Recent recalls and guidance cuts justify caution despite cheap valuation and CSS resilience. Moderate risk appetite warrants waiting for Q3 earnings (Oct 30, 2024 est.) and remediation proof.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $22 (80% upside from $12.27). Based on 12x FY2025E EBITDA ($220M est. per consensus), assuming TT stabilizes and 3% organic growth. Strong growth upside requires flawless execution; DCF implies $18-28 range (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth).",

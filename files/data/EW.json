Headquartered in Irvine, California, the company develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of surgical and transcatheter heart valves, advanced hemodynamic monitoring systems, and other technologies to treat advanced cardiovascular conditions. Its flagship products, such as the Sapien transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) platform, dominate the structural heart market, enabling minimally invasive procedures for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are high-risk for open-heart surgery. Edwards also offers surgical tissue heart valves (e.g., Magna Ease), repair systems for mitral and tricuspid valves (e.g., Cardioband), and critical care products like the HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform. With a focus on structural heart (93% of 2023 revenue), the company benefits from aging populations and rising demand for less invasive treatments. Edwards operates in over 100 countries, employing ~20,000 people, and reported fiscal 2023 revenue of $6.00 billion (up 11% YoY). It invests heavily in R&D (~10% of revenue), driving a pipeline of next-gen devices amid a TAVR market projected to grow at 20%+ CAGR through 2030. Challenges include intensifying competition and pricing pressures, but EW's ~50-60% global TAVR market share and procedural growth (e.g., 25%+ U.S. TAVR penetration) position it for sustained leadership.

EPS est. vs. historical 35x) amid TAVR competition fears, but Q2 momentum, RESILIA launches, and 12-15% revenue CAGR outlook support re-rating. Moderate risk from peers, offset by moat.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $90** (32% upside from $68.10; DCF-based using 12% growth to 2028, 4% terminal, 9% WACC; aligns with consensus targets from JPMorgan/BofA Oct 2024 ~$85-95). Hold for conservative; buy for growth portfolios.",

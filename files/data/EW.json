The company's robust clinical evidence, innovative pipeline, and strong financials support continued outperformance. However, the premium valuation, regulatory headwinds, and increasing competitive pressures limit the upside potential from current levels.\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $92-95\n\nBased on 2026 EPS guidance midpoint of $2.92 and applying a 32-33x forward P/E multiple (reflecting the quality of the business and growth prospects but accounting for valuation constraints), the fair value range is $92-95 per share, representing approximately 8-12% upside from current levels of ~$85.\n\n**Recommendation:** HOLD with a positive bias. While Edwards remains a high-quality growth company with excellent long-term prospects, investors should consider waiting for a pullback to the $75-80 range for more attractive entry points, or dollar-cost average into positions for long-term holders focused on the structural growth story.",

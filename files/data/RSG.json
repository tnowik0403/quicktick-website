(RSG) is one of North America's largest providers of non-hazardous solid waste disposal and recycling services, operating a vertically integrated network across 41 states and Puerto Rico. The company collects, transfers, recycles, and disposes of municipal solid waste (MSW), construction/demolition waste, and industrial waste for ~14 million residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers. Its operations include ~200 collection companies, 200+ transfer stations, 100+ recycling facilities, 75 landfills, and energy-from-waste plants. RSG emphasizes sustainability through its \"Recycling. Reimagined\" initiative, processing 5+ million tons of recyclables annually and investing in advanced MRFs (materials recovery facilities). With ~42,000 employees, RSG generated FY2023 revenue of $14.9B, focusing on core pricing discipline (5-6% organic growth), tuck-in acquisitions (~$400M/year), and ESG-driven innovations like EV fleet (1,000+ vehicles). As the #2 player behind Waste Management (WM), RSG holds ~15-20% U.S. market share in integrated waste services, benefiting from defensive demand tied to population growth and urbanization. Recent tailwinds include steady volume recovery post-COVID and recycling commodity upside, positioning it for mid-single-digit revenue/EBITDA growth.

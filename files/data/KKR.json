(NYSE: KKR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 12, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $138.24 (as of market close November 12, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $122.5 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg as of November 12, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $52.82 - $139.79  \n**YTD Performance:** +45.2% (outperforming S&P 500's +25.3%)  \n\n## Company Overview (218 words)\nKKR & Co. Inc. is a leading global investment firm founded in 1976, specializing in alternative asset management with approximately $553 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Q3 2024. The firm operates across private equity (PE), private credit, real estate, infrastructure, and insurance solutions, targeting direct investments, secondaries, and structured opportunities. KKR's business model generates revenue primarily through management fees (40-50% of fee-related earnings), performance fees (carried interest from realized investments), and capital allocation from its balance sheet.  \n\nHeadquartered in New York with 50 offices worldwide, KKR manages capital for institutional investors like pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments. It has evolved from a leveraged buyout pioneer (e.g., RJR Nabisco in 1989) into a diversified platform, with insurance assets via Global Atlantic adding recurring fee revenue. In Q3 2024, KKR deployed $24 billion and raised $39 billion in new capital, highlighting robust fundraising amid high interest rates. The firm's \"capital markets\" approach integrates origination, structuring, and distribution, positioning it as a one-stop shop for illiquid assets. KKR emphasizes ESG integration and long-term value creation through operational improvements in portfolio companies. With a 1.5% fee-related yield on AUM and growing insurance AUM (projected $100B+ by 2026), KKR is a high-growth alternative asset manager focused on compounding permanent capital.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported November 6, 2024):** Fee-related earnings (FRE) rose 25% YoY to $843 million (verified from KKR earnings release and transcript).

Moderate risk via 70% recurring revenue.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $165 (20% upside from $138.24). Based on 25x 2025 FRE ($3.8B projected, 20% growth) + 15x insurance value, discounted for execution risk. DCF implies $160-170; aligns with JPM/Keefe PTs. Hold if risk-averse; target 12-18 months.",

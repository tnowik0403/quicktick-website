(NYSE: GMRE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $9.12\n- **Market Capitalization**: $617.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $7.41 - $12.86\n- **Dividend Yield**: 9.21% (annualized forward dividend $0.84/share)\n- **P/FFO (TTM)**: 11.2x (vs. sector avg 14.5x)\n\n## Company Overview\nGlobal Medical REIT Inc. (GMRE) is a Baltimore-based real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, and leasing of freestanding, single-tenant medical office buildings and other healthcare-related properties across the United States. Founded in 2010 and publicly traded since 2013, GMRE operates under a net-lease model, where tenants (primarily healthcare providers) bear most operating expenses, providing stable, predictable cash flows. As of Q2 2024, the portfolio comprises 96 buildings totaling ~2.6 million rentable square feet across 16 states, with a diversified tenant base including physicians, outpatient facilities, and healthcare systems. Occupancy stands at 96.3%, with a weighted average lease term of 8.0 years and annual rent escalations averaging 2.0%. \n\nGMRE targets Class A/B medical offices in high-growth healthcare markets, focusing on creditworthy tenants like Encompass Health (20.7% of annualized base rent, ABR) and Chartwell Retirement Residences (11.1% ABR). The company benefits from healthcare's defensive nature—aging demographics drive ~4-5% annual demand growth for outpatient facilities—while navigating REIT triple-net lease advantages for high margins (AFFO payout ratio ~90%). Recent capital recycling (dispositions and acquisitions) has optimized the portfolio for higher yields. With a focus on external growth via accretive deals and internal rent growth, GMRE aims for mid-single-digit AFFO growth amid sector consolidation.

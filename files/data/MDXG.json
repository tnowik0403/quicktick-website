(NASDAQ: MDXG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close)  \n**Current Stock Price:** $7.68 (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.13 billion (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com)  \n**52-Week Range:** $5.22 - $9.70  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nMiMedx Group, Inc. (MDXG) is a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in regenerative medicine, with a focus on advanced wound care and surgical applications. The company develops, manufactures, and markets human placental tissue allografts and related medical devices derived from the amnion and chorion layers of donated placentas. Its flagship products, such as EpiFix, AmnioFix, and AmnioFill, are used to treat chronic wounds (e.g., diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers), burns, and surgical sites by promoting tissue regeneration, reducing inflammation, and accelerating healing. MiMedx operates primarily in the U.S., serving hospitals, outpatient wound care clinics, VA facilities, and physicians through a direct sales force of ~450 reps. The company emphasizes clinical evidence, with over 100 peer-reviewed publications supporting efficacy. In recent years, MiMedx has transformed from a history of legal and operational challenges (pre-2018) into a revenue-growth leader in the $5-7B advanced biologics wound care market, driven by reimbursement wins (e.g., Medicare Part B), sales expansion, and R&D in new formats like injectable and flowable matrices. International expansion (e.g., EU CE Mark) and pipeline innovations position it for sustained double-digit growth amid aging populations and rising chronic wounds.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Revenue $88.1M (+8% YoY), gross margin 80% (up from 78%), net income $10.4M (EPS $0.07 vs. -$0.04 YoY).

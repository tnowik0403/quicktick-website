Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company operates primarily through two segments: Credit as a Service (CaaS) and Lending & Investing (L&I). The CaaS segment enables banks and credit unions to issue branded credit cards and personal loans via Atlanticus' proprietary OPEN platform, handling origination, underwriting, accounts receivable sales, and servicing. Key brands include Fortiva (retail credit cards), OpenSky (secured Visa cards for no-credit consumers), and Credit One Bank (subprime unsecured cards, though Credit One is a separate entity; Atlanticus partners similarly). The L&I segment involves direct lending and investments in consumer loans, auto finance, and point-of-sale financing.\n\nAtlanticus focuses on \"second-chance\" financing, targeting ~40 million underserved Americans. It leverages data-driven underwriting, AI/ML models, and a funding model blending securitizations, warehouse facilities, and whole loan sales. With ~$3.5B in managed receivables (Q2 2024), it emphasizes high-yield assets amid rising credit demand. The company went public in 1990, has paid dividends sporadically, and trades at ~2x book value. Recent growth stems from CaaS expansion, with 2023 revenue hitting $292M (up 34% YoY). Challenges include charge-off sensitivity to economic cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Record net income of $30.4M ($2.10/share, up 58% YoY); total revenue $143.3M (up 22% YoY); CaaS receivables grew 28% to $2.7B.

hold for conservatives). Rationale: 25%+ revenue CAGR, undervalued at 2x book vs. peers' 3x+, robust Q2 beat, rate-cut tailwinds. Risks: Credit cycle (20% downside if recession).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $55 (33% upside from $41.24). DCF-based (15% IRR, 25% growth to 2026 tapering to 10%; terminal 12x P/E), supported by analyst targets (avg. $52 from B. Riley, Janney; Seeking Alpha Oct 2024 quant models). Moderate risk: Beta 1.8, but diversified funding mitigates.",

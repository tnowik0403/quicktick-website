(NYSE: CLPR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data):**  \n- Stock Price: $4.92  \n- Market Capitalization: $96.2 million  \n- 52-Week Range: $3.96 - $6.49  \n- Dividend Yield: 9.35% (annualized $0.46/share)  \n- P/FFO (TTM): ~8.5x  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nClipper Realty Inc. is a self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, management, operation, and repositioning of multifamily residential and commercial properties in prime New York City neighborhoods, primarily Manhattan (e.g., Tribeca, Kips Bay) and Brooklyn (e.g., Boerum Hill, Prospect Heights). Founded in 2013 and public since 2016, Clipper focuses on value-add strategies in rent-stabilized and market-rate assets to drive occupancy, rental income, and net operating income (NOI) growth. As of Q2 2024, its portfolio comprises 28 properties totaling ~5,750 residential units (predominantly 1-2 bedroom apartments) and ~95,000 square feet of retail/office space. Key assets include Tribeca House (luxury rentals), 10 Park Place (mixed-use), and Clover Community (affordable housing conversions). The company generates revenue primarily from residential rents (~90%), with commercial leases (~10%) from tenants like grocers and services. Clipper emphasizes hands-on asset management, unit renovations (averaging $20K-30K/unit for 15-20% rent bumps), and opportunistic refinancing/acquisitions amid NYC's chronic housing shortage. Despite market headwinds like rent regulations, its urban focus leverages high barriers to entry and sustained tenant demand from young professionals and families.

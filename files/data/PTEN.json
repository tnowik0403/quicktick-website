(PTEN) is a premier onshore energy service provider primarily serving the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company operates through three main segments: Contract Drilling, Pressure Pumping, and Drilling Products. Its Contract Drilling division owns and operates one of the largest fleets of high-specification drilling rigs in North America, emphasizing super-spec rigs optimized for efficiency in key shale basins like the Permian. The Pressure Pumping segment delivers hydraulic fracturing (frac) services, with a fleet exceeding 1.7 million hydraulic horsepower (HHP), bolstered by the 2023 NexTier merger. Drilling Products provides consumables, rentals, and technologies like the proprietary NOVOS digital optimization platform. PTEN focuses on technological innovation to reduce drilling times and costs, targeting E&P operators in active basins. With ~130 active rigs (out of ~600 total U.S. land rigs) and a strong Permian presence, PTEN benefits from U.S. shale resilience amid global energy demand.

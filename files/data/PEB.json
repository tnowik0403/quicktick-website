It provides midstream services including transportation, processing, and storage of hydrocarbons across Western Canada and North Dakota. The company operates ~17,000 km of pipelines, 26 natural gas processing facilities, and fractionation/n fractionation hubs, primarily serving the Montney, Duvernay, and oil sands regions. Pembina's assets are divided into three segments: Pipelines (crude oil, liquids, and gas transmission), Facilities (gas processing, fractionation, and storage), and Marketing & New Ventures (propane export and third-party services).  \n\nWith a focus on fee-for-service contracts (over 90% of EBITDA), Pembina benefits from stable cash flows insulated from commodity volatility.

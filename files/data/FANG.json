We forecast the Brent crude oil price will average $56 per barrel (b) in 2026, 19% less than in 2025\n- **Industry Consolidation**: Increased competition from larger integrated players like ExxonMobil and Chevron\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n- **Operational Efficiency**: The company reported net proven reserves of 3.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and maintained an average production of approximately 598,000 barrels per day in 2024, demonstrating robust operational efficiency.\n- **Scale Advantages**: Post-merger scale benefits and synergies from Endeavor acquisition\n- **Low-Cost Structure**: Competitive breakeven costs in premium Permian acreage\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Permian Basin Position**: This merger potentially makes Diamondback the third-largest Permian producer, trailing only after ExxonMobil and Chevron.\n\n**Competitive Landscape**: Companies with a strong foothold in the Permian, including EOG Resources EOG, Diamondback Energy FANG, ExxonMobil XOM and Chevron CVX, are well-positioned to capitalize on its potential, making them standout investment opportunities.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Vs. EOG Resources**: Diamondback Energy is trading at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than EOG Resources, indicating that it is currently the more affordable of the two stocks.\n\n**Vs. Integrated Oil**: Diamondback Energy is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.48. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.57, so one might conclude that Diamondback Energy is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\n**Market Position**: Expected to close during the fourth quarter, the deal would create the largest company dedicated solely to the basin, and the new company would trail only Exxon and Chevron in terms of total oil production in the Permian\n\n## 11.

(\"Endeavor\"), today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Diamondback and Endeavor will merge in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of Endeavor's net debt.\n- **Completion**: Two Midland-based companies that dominate in the Permian Basin are now one as Diamondback Energy has completed its $26 billion merger with Endeavor Energy Resources.\n\n**Strategic Benefits**: Total annual cost savings are forecast to be $550 million, driven in large part by Diamondback's lower cost structure and about 100,000 acres held by the two companies that touch or overlap.\n\n## 12.

(FANG) is a leading independent exploration and production (E&P) company primarily focused on the development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin across West Texas and New Mexico. The company operates through two main segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), which accounts for the vast majority of revenue via drilling and completing wells, and Midstream, which includes gathering, processing, and transportation services via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Viper Energy Partners. Post its transformative $26 billion merger with Endeavor Energy Resources (closed September 10, 2024), Diamondback has solidified its position as one of the largest Permian pure-plays, with ~487,000 net acres, emphasizing low-cost, high-margin inventory. In 2025, FANG produced ~850,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), with 65% oil mix, leveraging proprietary horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques for capital efficiency. The company prioritizes free cash flow (FCF) generation, shareholder returns via dividends (yielding ~2.5%) and buybacks ($2.1B authorized in 2025), and disciplined growth amid volatile energy markets. Recent integrations have enhanced scale, with Q3 2025 production up 28% YoY.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **September 10, 2024:** Completed $26B all-stock merger with Endeavor Energy, adding 337,000 net acres and boosting Permian inventory to 20+ years at current pace (per company press release).\n- **November 4, 2025:** Q3 2025 earnings: Production averaged 858,492 BOE/d (65% oil);

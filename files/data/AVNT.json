Headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio, the company operates in two primary segments: Color, Additives, and Inks (CAI), which accounts for ~85% of revenue, and Specialty Engineered Materials (SEM). CAI delivers advanced colorants, formulations, and inks for applications in consumer goods, packaging, healthcare, and transportation, emphasizing sustainability through bio-based and recycled content solutions. SEM focuses on high-performance engineered composites for mobility (e.g., automotive, aerospace), healthcare (e.g., medical devices), and construction. With ~10,000 employees across 60+ countries and 50+ manufacturing sites, Avient serves blue-chip clients in diversified end-markets. The company prioritizes sustainability, targeting 50% sustainable solutions by 2030 and net-zero Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2050. FY2023 revenue was ~$3.1B (verified Q4 2023 10-K), with a focus on high-margin, value-added products amid a shift from commodity chemicals post-2022 divestitures. Avient's strategy leverages innovation in circular economy solutions, supported by a robust R&D pipeline and acquisitions like DMAPEX (2024) for sustainable polymers.

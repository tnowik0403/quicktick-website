The company operates in the aerospace aftermarket (sole-source proprietary parts) and OEM markets, focusing on high-margin, mission-critical products like actuators, pumps, valves, ignition systems, cockpit security systems, and engine components. With over 300 subsidiaries worldwide, TDG serves major airframers (Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin) and aftermarket channels via distributors and MRO providers.\n\nFounded in 1993 and public since 2006, TDG has built a reputation for operational excellence and acquisitive growth, targeting fragmented markets with \"TransDigm-like\" businesses—high EBITDA margins (>30%), proprietary tech, and pricing power. Revenue is split ~65% commercial aerospace (aftermarket dominant), ~25% military, ~10% non-aviation. The company benefits from aircraft fleet aging, driving aftermarket demand, and military spending surges. FY2024 revenue reached $7.94 billion (up 20.8% YoY per Q4 earnings Nov 7, 2024), with EBITDA margins at 42.1%. TDG's \"buy-and-build\" model has driven 15-20% organic growth post-COVID, positioning it as a consolidator in a $100B+ aerospace components market. Risks include supply chain disruptions and OEM production delays, but tailwinds from air travel recovery and defense budgets support long-term outperformance.

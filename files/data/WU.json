(WU) is a global leader in cross-border money movement, facilitating remittances, payments, and financial services primarily for underserved populations. Founded in 1851 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company operates through two main segments: Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) and Consumer-to-Business (C2B). C2C, which accounts for ~90% of revenue, enables individuals to send money internationally via a network of ~500,000 agent locations in 200+ countries and territories, alongside digital channels like the Western Union app and website. C2B, via the Speedpay brand, processes bill payments, money orders, and prepaid services mainly in the U.S. In 2023, WU processed 258 million C2C transactions worth $112 billion in principal, serving migrants and unbanked users. The company has pivoted toward digital growth amid competition from fintechs, investing in app enhancements, partnerships, and regulatory compliance (e.g., AML/KYC). Recent focus includes emerging markets like India and Latin America, where remittance demand remains robust due to migration and economic disparities. Despite mature agent networks providing sticky revenue, WU faces margin pressure from digital shifts and geopolitical risks. With ~9,000 employees, WU emphasizes low-cost, reliable transfers, holding a strong position in agent-based remittances while expanding wallet-enabled and account-to-account services.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released July 30, 2024, verified via WU Investor Relations and SEC 8-K):** Revenue $1.045 billion (-1% YoY constant currency); GAAP net income $120 million (EPS $0.51 diluted); Adjusted EPS $0.45.

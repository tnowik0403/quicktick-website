Company Overview\n\nMondelēz International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ) is one of the world's largest snacks companies, empowering people to snack right in over 150 countries. We are one of the largest snack companies in the world with global net revenues of approximately $36 billion in 2024. We hold the #1 global position in biscuits (cookies and crackers) and #2 in chocolate. The company, through its subsidiaries, manufactures, markets, and sells snack food and beverage products in Latin America, North America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.\n\nMondelēz has operated independently since its split from the former Kraft Foods North American grocery business in October 2012. The company is a leading player in the global snack enclave with a presence in the biscuit (49% of sales as of the end of fiscal 2024), chocolate (31%), gum/candy (11%), beverage (3%), and cheese and grocery (6%) aisles. The firm derives around one-third of its revenue from developing markets, more than one-third from Europe, and the remainder from North America.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nCurrent stock performance reflects ongoing challenges. As of January 15, 2026, MDLZ closed at $53.74 with a 52-week range of $52.79 - $71.15. The market capitalization is $68.702B with a PE ratio (TTM) of 19.89 and EPS (TTM) of $2.67. The forward dividend yield is 3.72% with a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Market cap as of December 12, 2025 was $69.75B, indicating recent market volatility. Over the past 30 days, its market cap decreased by -10.57%, while in the last 12 months, it decreased by -6.99%.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nMondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar components: cookie, cracker, and candy brands TUC, Nabisco (manufacturers of Belvita, Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, Ritz, Triscuit, Wheat Thins), LU, Sour Patch Kids, Barny, and Peek Freans; chocolate brands Milka, Côte d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Green & Black's, Freia, Marabou, and Fry's; gum and cough drop brands Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, and Stride; as well as Tate's Bake Shop cookies and powdered beverage brand Tang.\n\nBiscuits and Baked Snacks is a core segment for Mondelez, boasting an extensive portfolio including Oreo (the world's best-selling cookie), Chips Ahoy!, Ritz crackers, Triscuit, Wheat Thins, and Premium Plus Crackers. In chocolate, Mondelez is a major player with brands including Cadbury (heritage British chocolate maker), Milka (beloved European brand), and Toblerone (distinctive triangular shape).\n\nThe company has successfully expanded beyond traditional snacking through strategic acquisitions. In June 2022, Mondelez announced it would acquire Clif Bar for $2.9 billion, obtaining Clif, Luna, and Clif Bar Kids as part of its portfolio.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nA key strategic initiative for 2025 is the aggressive expansion into the cakes and pastries segment. This market is estimated to grow from $94.64 billion in 2024 to $101.92 billion in 2025, with projections to reach $195.3 billion by 2033. The Company's $2 billion cakes and pastries business, which currently holds a #3 global share position, is growing share and is well-positioned to accelerate growth.\n\nProduct innovation is a key focus with new formats like Milka brownies and Oreo cakes introduced in 2024. RITZ Crackers introduced a new Hot Honey flavor in February 2025. The company introduced new varieties such as zero-sugar Oreos in China in 2024.\n\nThe company is investing over $1 billion to become the digital commerce snacks leader, aiming for 20% of revenues from digital channels by 2030. Mondelez developed a generative AI tool called AIDA (AI + Data) for advertising, spending upwards of $40 million on this technology, expecting to cut marketing content creation costs by up to 50% in the long term.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nMondelez targets long-term sales growth of 3%-5% as it seeks to sell its wares across more channels and reinvests in new products aligned with evolving consumer trends at home and abroad. The company updated its long-term algorithm to 3%-5% Organic Net Revenue growth. It will drive value through organic growth and targeted acquisitions that expand its presence in chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks by filling geographic gaps and extending into under-represented segments and price tiers.\n\nMondelēz is reshaping its portfolio, with a long-term vision to accelerate growth and generate 90% of revenue in chocolate and biscuits, including baked snacks. Chocolate and biscuits are attractive and historically durable categories in both developed and emerging markets, with significant headroom to increase penetration and per capita consumption.\n\nThe company remains committed to an acquisition strategy focused on bolt-on assets similar to recent acquisitions of Chipita, Clif and Ricolino. Management emphasizes continued progress against their strategy of accelerating growth and focusing their portfolio in the attractive, resilient categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company serves supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores, and other retail food outlets through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers, third-party distributors, and other facilities, as well as through independent sales offices and agents. The company also sells products directly to businesses and consumers through e-retail platforms, retailer digital platforms, as well as through its direct-to-consumer websites and social media platforms.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nFor 2025, the company now expects Organic Net Revenue growth of 4%+ and Adjusted EPS to decline approximately 15% on a constant currency basis. The company continues to expect 2025 Free Cash Flow of $3+ billion. The company returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in cash dividends and share repurchases in the first nine months of 2025.\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Q3 2025 EPS of $0.73, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.71 by 2.82%\n- Gross profit of $2.6 billion (decrease of 12.9%) and operating income of $744 million (down 35.5%)\n- Q3 2025 net revenues: $9,744 million\n\nRevenue for 2024 was $36.4B with 1.2% growth vs 2023. Market cap is $69.3B. We are one of the largest snack companies in the world with global net revenues of approximately $36 billion in 2024.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Major Headwinds:**\nCocoa prices soared by nearly three times between late 2023 and early 2025, attributed to low global stocks causing major supply deficits coupled with extreme and unpredictable weather patterns affecting harvests. Adjusted EPS was down 24.2% on a constant currency basis driven by operating declines. The company faces unprecedented cocoa cost inflation that has driven chocolate raw material costs up 30%, retailer destocking in the U.S. and Europe creating a 250-basis-point volume headwind, and fragile consumer confidence pushing pricing elasticity beyond historical norms.\n\nUnprecedented cocoa cost inflation in 2025 significantly impacted gross margins, leading to an 18.3% drop in adjusted EPS in Q1 2025. Pricing actions of 6.6% in Q1 2025 were implemented to counter this. Developed markets experienced volume/mix declines of -3.5%.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nManagement is encouraged by recent moderation in cocoa prices, as well as promising signs for a strong cocoa crop this fall. Mondelēz possesses a unique global footprint that over-indexes to snacking occasions. Snacking is an advantaged category that benefits from robust pricing power, low private label competition and rising per capita consumption.\n\nThe company operates in the global snack food market, which is expected to reach $248.77 billion in 2025.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWe hold the #1 global position in biscuits (cookies and crackers) and #2 in chocolate, while we're growing rapidly in baked snacks. As of 2025, it held the second-largest share in the global chocolate market at 12.3%. The company holds the number one rank in the global snack food market with an estimated 16% market share.\n\nThe acquisition of Chipita puts Mondelez in the \"No. 3 position\" in packaged cakes and pastries, which is asserted to be a $65 billion market. The Company's $2 billion cakes and pastries business currently holds a #3 global share position.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe company's primary competitors are major multinational food and beverage conglomerates including PepsiCo, Nestlé, Mars, The Hershey Company, Kraft Heinz, Kellogg Company, General Mills, Ferrero Group, Grupo Bimbo, and Conagra Brands.\n\nPepsiCo reported nearly $92 billion in revenue for 2025, with its snack brands directly challenging Mondelez's offerings. Nestlé, the world's largest food company with 2025 revenue of $101.54 billion, competes across confectionery, dairy, and coffee, impacting Mondelez's chocolate and biscuit segments.\n\nMars holds a substantial share of the global chocolate market with powerhouse brands like M&M's and Snickers. While Mondelez has a great selection of global snack brands, Mars benefits from its brand loyalty and recognition among consumers for chocolate-based products.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\nOn May 26, 2021, Mondelez announced an agreement to acquire Greek snack company Chipita S.A. On January 3, 2022, the acquisition was complete. In May 2022, Mondelez acquired Grupo Bimbo's confectionery business, Ricolino, for approximately US$1.3 billion. Mondelez's most recent acquisition is Evirthfood, a manufacturer of premium frozen baked goods, acquired in September 2024.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nMondelēz joined the 100+ Accelerator in May 2025 as the sixth corporate partner alongside AB InBev, The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, Danone, and Unilever. Launched in 2018, the program was created to rapidly pilot and scale solutions in regenerative agriculture, circular packaging, and energy efficiency.\n\nThe company developed co-branded chocolate products, with initial launches planned for early 2025, including Cadbury and Biscoff in the UK, and Milka and Biscoff in Europe. Mondelez also executed a limited-edition co-branding effort with The Coca-Cola Company.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q3 2025 Performance (October 28, 2025):**\nMondelēz reported Q3 2025 results showing solid top-line growth despite record-high cocoa cost inflation, with Q3 representing peak costs of the year. Q3 2025 net revenues reached $9,744 million.\n\n**Product Recalls (December 2025):**\nIn December 2025, the company expanded voluntary recalls of CHIPS AHOY! Baked Bites Brookie products in the US.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 6.8/10**\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $62-66**\n\n**Rationale:**\nDespite significant near-term challenges from cocoa inflation and margin compression, Mondelēz demonstrates several compelling investment qualities. The company's strong pricing power and commodity relief position it to help improve margins as these attributes will help sustain industry-leading growth. The company presents competitive advantage with ROIC exceeding WACC by 4.39% and 82% growth in ROIC over 2020-2024, maintaining favorable profitability metrics including 39.12% gross margin and 18.58% EBIT margin.\n\n**Positive Factors:**\n- Market-leading positions (#1 in biscuits globally, #2 in chocolate)\n- Strong brand portfolio with iconic names (Oreo, Cadbury, Ritz)\n- Robust free cash flow generation ($3+ billion expected in 2025)\n- Strong capital returns to shareholders ($3.7B in first nine months of 2025)\n- Strategic expansion into high-growth cakes and pastries market\n- Improving cocoa market outlook with price moderation expected\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Cocoa costs remain a major headwind with unprecedented inflation potentially cutting adjusted EPS by 15% in 2025\n- Volume/mix declines in key markets due to pricing elasticity\n- Challenging North American consumer environment\n- Market cap volatility (down ~7% over 12 months)\n\nThe fair value range of $62-66 represents approximately 15-25% upside from current levels, reflecting the temporary nature of cocoa inflation headwinds against the company's strong fundamental business model and market positions. The investment rating of 6.8/10 indicates a moderate buy recommendation with strong growth potential once commodity pressures normalize.",

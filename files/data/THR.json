(THR) is a global leader in engineered thermal solutions, specializing in industrial process heating, temperature maintenance, and environmental monitoring systems. Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company designs, manufactures, and sells products like heat tracing cables, control systems, sensors, and thermostats for critical applications in energy, chemicals, power generation, and infrastructure sectors. Thermon's solutions prevent freezing, ensure process efficiency, and support safety in harsh environments, with a focus on the energy transition (e.g., renewables, electrification, and decarbonization).\n\nOperating in over 30 countries with ~1,800 employees, Thermon derives ~45% of revenue from the U.S., ~25% from Canada/Europe, and the rest from Asia-Pacific and other regions. Key end-markets include oil & gas (40-45% of sales), chemical & petrochemical (20-25%), power generation (15-20%), and emerging areas like data centers and renewables. The company emphasizes customized, hazardous-location-rated products compliant with global standards (e.g., ATEX, IECEx).\n\nRecent strategic shifts highlight diversification beyond traditional oil & gas, targeting hyperscale data centers, EV battery plants, and LNG export facilities amid the global push for net-zero emissions. Thermon's scalable platform supports maintenance, repair & overhaul (MRO) contracts and turnkey project installations, driving recurring revenue. With a robust balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~1.5x) and organic growth plus bolt-on M&A, Thermon is positioned for mid-single-digit revenue expansion in a fragmented $3-4B global heat tracing market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (ended August 31, 2024; reported October 24, 2024)**: Revenue $120.0M (flat YoY); GAAP net income $9.8M ($0.29/share); Adjusted EBITDA $24.5M (20.4% margin, up 50bps YoY).

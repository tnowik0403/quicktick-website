Headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, the company slaughters ~140 million birds weekly (U.S./Puerto Rico) and processes ~8.5 million in Mexico, making it the #2 U.S. chicken producer by capacity. PPC serves retail, foodservice, and export channels with branded products like Just BARE (antibiotic-free), Gold'n Plump, and private-label offerings. Wholly owned by JBS S.A. since Dec 2019 acquisition ($2.26B deal), PPC benefits from synergies in feed, distribution, and Latin American ops. In FY2023, U.S. sales were ~75% of total, Mexico ~20%, with exports to >90 countries. The company focuses on premium proteins amid rising protein demand, navigating commodity cycles via vertical integration (farms to processing). Recent strength in Mexico (record volumes) and U.S. Big Bird sales offset HPAI pressures.

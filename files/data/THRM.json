Founded in 1991 and headquartered in Northville, Michigan, the company designs, manufactures, and sells thermally active products like Climate Control Seats (CCS), battery performance enhancement technologies (BPET), electronics thermal management, and cabin heaters/comfort systems. Its automotive segment (~95% of revenue) targets OEMs, while the medical segment provides patient temperature management devices.\n\nGentherm holds dominant positions in niche markets, such as ~75% global share in active CCS. With ~14,000 employees across 50+ facilities worldwide, it benefits from long-term supply contracts (average 5-7 years) with blue-chip clients. Recent focus shifts toward high-growth EV applications, including battery preconditioning to extend range by 10-20%, amid the global auto transition. FY2024 guidance projects revenue of $495-505M, driven by EV ramps despite cyclical auto headwinds. Gentherm's edge lies in proprietary Peltier thermoelectric tech, enabling compact, efficient solutions amid tightening emissions regs and consumer demand for comfort.\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Q2 FY2025 Earnings - Aug 7, 2024 Release)\n| Metric                  | Q2 FY2025 | YoY Change | Notes |\n|-------------------------|-----------|------------|-------|\n| Revenue                | $119.5M  | -7.5%     | Automotive OEM down due to CCS softness; BPET up 20%+ |\n| GAAP Net Income        | $4.8M    | N/A       | EPS $0.15 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA        | $15.9M   | -10%      | Margin 13.3% |\n| Gross Margin (GAAP)    | 24.5%    | +50 bps   | Supply chain efficiencies |\n| FY2025 Guidance        | $495-505M revenue; Adj.

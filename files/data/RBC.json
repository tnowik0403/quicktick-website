Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI Platform Development:** RBC Capital Markets developed the AidenResearch Platform—a suite of specialized AI agents tailored for its Global Research division. This platform enables analysts to focus on high-value, data-driven client work while AI agents handle tasks such as generating earnings-related content, summarizing calls, surfacing insights from data catalogs, and providing real-time access to filings. As a result, the Research team has been able to deliver deeper insights to clients faster than ever before.\n\nBuilding on this success, RBC is developing AidenBanker—a unified platform for bankers that connects essential functions like automated pitchbook creation, pre-meeting preparation, and comprehensive note-taking. Other lines of business across RBC Capital Markets are now using the Aiden platform. With over 8,000 users benefiting from these capabilities, RBC is delivering timely, data-driven advice to clients, shortening time-to-market, and improving the overall client experience.\n\n**Blockchain and Digital Innovation:** Blockchain Integration: RBC plans to expand its blockchain-based cross-border payment solution to cover major global corridors, potentially disrupting the traditional SWIFT system.

Growth Strategy\n\n**US Wealth Management Focus:** Royal Bank of Canada is sharpening its focus on the US wealth management market, with chief executive officer Dave McKay signaling a willingness to pursue acquisitions of established firms as part of a broader growth strategy. Speaking to Bloomberg, McKay said the bank is interested in acquiring \"highly coveted\" wealth management businesses that can bring in new clients and, critically, contribute significant sweep deposits to bolster RBC's funding base in the United States. \"We want more customers, we want that relationship,\" McKay said, emphasizing the importance of deepening client connections through both organic growth and targeted deals.\n\n**Technology-First Approach:** With a 16% increase in digital banking adoption over the past year, RBC is poised to accelerate its tech-first strategy. The bank's strategic direction focuses on seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technology with human expertise to deliver unparalleled financial services across North America and beyond.\n\n**Target Demographics:** Using the Strategy Triangle framework: Where to Play: RBC is focusing on tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z customers across North America, as well as expanding its services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n**US Operating Model:** Build a more inter-connected U.S. operating model focused on target segments · Expand the total addressable market through Transaction Banking · Deepen client relationships by enhancing the client value proposition · Add more client-facing financial advisors, investment bankers and relationship managers\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Wealth Management Scale:** RBC Wealth Management counts itself among the largest financial services firms in the United States, with $640 billion in total client assets as of April 2025 and more than 2,200 financial advisors operating from 192 offices across 42 states.\n\n**HSBC Client Integration:** RBC's HSBC Canada deal positions it as the bank of choice for newcomers and commercial clients with international needs. The acquisition brought some 780,000 HSBC customers and 4,500 employees into RBC's client base.\n\n**Global Connectivity:** Our relentless client focus is shaping everything we do--from the way we're expanding our global franchises to how we're delivering the insights and trusted advice that help clients navigate a rapidly changing economy. As shared at our Investor Day, combining this with global connectivity and scale is the foundation for how RBC will continue creating long-term value for our 19+ million clients.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2025 Results:** Royal Bank of Canada reported net income of $20.4 billion for the year ended October 31, 2025, up $4.1 billion or 25% from the prior year. Diluted EPS was $14.07, up 25% over the prior year reflecting growth across each of our business segments. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS of $20.9 billion and $14.43 were up 20% and 19%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\n**Dividend Increase:** Today, we declared a quarterly dividend of $1.64 per share reflecting an increase of $0.10 or 6%.\n\n**ROE Target Revision:** For fiscal 2026, we have revised our ROE financial objective to 17%+ to reflect improving revenue productivity and cost efficiencies driven by the execution of our strategic initiatives.\n\n**Segment Performance:** \n- 20% earnings growth in Personal Banking, primarily driven by higher net interest income reflecting higher spreads and average volume growth of 7% in Personal Banking – Canada.\n- 14% earnings growth in Insurance, primarily due to higher insurance service result driven by improved claims experience in longevity reinsurance and life retrocession products.\n- 18% earnings growth in Capital Markets, primarily due to higher revenue in Global Markets and Corporate & Investment Banking.\n\n**Credit Quality:** Our consolidated results include higher provisions on impaired loans, primarily in Commercial Banking, Personal Banking and Capital Markets. The PCL on impaired loans ratio was 37 bps, up 9 bps from the prior year. Pre-provision, pre-tax earnings of $30 billion were up 30% from last year, mainly due to higher net interest income reflecting solid average volume growth in Personal Banking and Commercial Banking and higher spreads across most of our business segments.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- CUSMA protections shielded most Canadian exports, while the Bank of Canada's interest rate cuts, fiscal support, and a recovery in household balance sheets helped sustain consumer spending through significant uncertainty. We've seen early signs that make us cautiously optimistic for Canada's outlook in 2026, barring any external shocks.\n- The BoC cut rates four times in 2025, bringing a total of 275 basis points of cuts since 2024. Our forecast adds 0.4 percentage point to GDP growth in 2025 and 2026.\n- With Canada's immigration targets set to ramp up in the coming years, that gives RBC a leg up on all those new clients. \"The proposed acquisition does provide the bank with the opportunity to be the bank of choice for newcomers as well as commercial clients with international needs,\" he said in an interview.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Though, distinct regional challenges, softness in the housing market, and a demographic slowdown remain headwinds ahead.\n- Canada's jobs market has shown signs of improvement in recent months, but the uncertainty stemming from trade policy risks extending a decade of business underinvestment—a key contributor to the country's lagging productivity growth.\n- Demographics reshape Canada's growth story: Zero population growth in 2026 means GDP will expand at a slower rate this year, driven entirely by per-capita improvements after past central bank rate cuts—a meaningful departure from prior year trends. Canada will experience zero population growth in 2026 for the first time on record dating back to the 1950s due to the government's pivot on immigration policy.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Canadian Banking Market:** RBC is Canada's largest bank in terms of market capitalization. Biggest bank in Canada in terms of market share and most ATMs\n\n**Market Position:** As the second-largest bank in Canada, TD Bank Group commands a substantial market share. With total assets reaching C$2.06 trillion as of October 31, 2024, and C$2.1 trillion on April 30, 2025, the bank demonstrates considerable financial scale. This suggests RBC, as the largest bank, likely has even greater assets.\n\n**Deposit Market Share:** We also maintained our number one market share position in Personal Core Deposits and Guaranteed Investment Certificates.\n\n**US Market:** RBC Wealth Management counts itself among the largest financial services firms in the United States, with $640 billion in total client assets as of April 2025 and more than 2,200 financial advisors operating from 192 offices across 42 states.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Big Six Banks Performance:** Despite simmering concerns about the impact of tariffs, the Big Six banks have gained nearly 40 per cent in 2025, on average, including dividends.\n\n**RBC vs Competitors:**\n- RBC is hardly struggling through operational challenges. It reported $20.4-billion in net earnings this fiscal year, which ended Oct. 31, up 25 per cent from the same period last year. It was up 24.7 per cent at the end of November, and commands a premium valuation.\n- According to a ranking produced by Standard & Poor's, in 2017, the Big Five banks of Canada are among the world's 100 largest banks, with TD, RBC, Scotiabank, BMO, and CIBC at 26th, 28th, 45th, 52nd, and 63rd place, respectively. RBC and TD Bank are also on the Financial Stability Board's list of systemically important banks as of 2020.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:** For RBC, the country's largest bank by market share, combining with HSBC Bank Canada would strategically expand its Canadian business, while fulfilling key priorities such as generating new sources of deposits and carving out new competitive advantages.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Acquisition - HSBC Canada:** Royal Bank of Canada today announced it has completed the acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada (\"HSBC Canada\"). Under the terms of the agreement, RBC will acquire 100% of the common shares of HSBC Canada for an all-cash purchase price of $13.5 billion.\n\nThe acquisition was strategically significant: That meant RBC needed to migrate more than 780,000 clients and 4,500 employees to RBC systems over a 48-hour period, not to mention the conversion of five new business lines and the overnight transformation of more than 125 branches from HSBC Bank Canada to RBC.\n\n**Expected Synergies:** RBC expects to achieve approximately $740 million, or 55%, in fully realized annual pre-tax expense synergies based on HSBC Canada's estimated 2024 non-interest expense base, and incur total acquisition and integration costs of approximately $1 billion.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:** Eurasia Group and Royal Bank of Canada today announced a new three-year strategic partnership beginning in 2026.\n\n**Potential US Acquisitions:** While McKay did not name specific acquisition targets, he acknowledged that several \"high-quality wealth franchises\" are on RBC's radar, and that any move in the market would likely face stiff competition from other buyers.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q4 2025 Earnings Beat:** RBC reported record Q4 2025 earnings of CAD 5.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations and driving a 0.79% stock increase to CAD 155.5 in pre-market trading.\n\n**Technology Investment:** The bank's open banking platform, RBC Connect, has onboarded over 200 fintech partners, creating a thriving ecosystem that drives innovation and customer acquisition.\n\n**Awards and Recognition:** RBC was awarded the 2025 M&A Deal of the Year, Banking & Financial Services Law Department of the Year and the Canadian Law Department of the Year at the Canadian Law Awards in May.\n\n**Interest Rate Environment:** On December 10, 2025, the Bank of Canada announced that it is holding its interest rate at 2.25%. For now, we maintain our forecast that the BoC will hold the overnight rate steady at 2.25% throughout 2026 before raising it back up to the top of the 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range in 2027.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus:** Based on our analysis of 6 Wall Street analysts, RY has a bullish consensus with a median price target of $155.21 (ranging from $121.44 to $163.96). Currently trading at $147.20, the median forecast implies a 5.4% upside. This outlook is supported by 11 Buy, 3 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings.\n\n**Financial Metrics:** Royal Bank of Canada has a market capitalization of $208.41B with a P/E ratio of 15.4x. The company generates $43.32B in trailing twelve-month revenue with a 31.8% profit margin. Revenue growth is +15.3% quarter-over-quarter, while maintaining an operating margin of +45.4% and return on equity of +14.7%.\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Market-leading position in Canadian banking\n- Successful HSBC integration adding scale and capabilities\n- Strong digital transformation and AI initiatives\n- Robust financial performance with 25% earnings growth\n- Solid dividend growth (6% increase) and strong ROE target (17%+)\n- Diversified revenue streams across multiple business segments\n- Strong capital position and credit quality\n\n**Investment Considerations:**\n- Canadian demographic headwinds with zero population growth expected\n- Competitive US market expansion challenges\n- Interest rate environment uncertainties\n- Integration risks from major acquisitions\n\n**Buy Rating:** 7.8/10\n\n**Estimated Fair Value:** CAD $178-$185\n\nThe rating reflects RBC's dominant market position, successful strategic execution (particularly the HSBC integration), strong financial performance, and promising growth initiatives in AI and digital banking. However, the rating is tempered by macroeconomic headwinds, demographic challenges in Canada, and execution risks in competitive US markets. The fair value estimate represents approximately 5-10% upside from current levels, supported by the bank's strong fundamentals, dividend growth, and strategic positioning for long-term growth.",

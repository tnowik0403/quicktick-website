Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, RBC provides a full spectrum of financial services to approximately 17 million clients globally through four primary business segments: Personal and Commercial Banking (PCB), Wealth Management (WM), Insurance, and City National Bank (CNB, U.S. regional banking) within Capital Markets. \n\nIn Canada, RBC dominates retail and commercial banking with deposit, lending, mortgage, and small business services. Its WM division manages CAD 1.1 trillion in assets under administration (as of Q3 FY2024), offering investment advice, mutual funds, and private banking. Insurance provides life, health, travel, and property/casualty products, while Capital Markets delivers global investment banking, trading, and corporate lending. RBC's U.S. footprint, bolstered by CNB (acquired 2015), focuses on high-net-worth clients in key markets like California and New York.\n\nRBC emphasizes digital innovation (e.g., RBC Mobile app with 12M+ users), sustainability (net-zero by 2050 commitment), and client-centric growth. With a diversified revenue stream—43% from Canada PCB, 27% WM, 11% Insurance, 19% Capital Markets—it reported record annual revenue of CAD 56.1B in FY2023. RBC's risk-adjusted capital strength (CET1 ratio 14.9% as of July 31, 2024) and consistent dividends (yield ~3.4%) make it a cornerstone of Canadian finance.

(BIIB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Report Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Current Stock Price:** $212.45 (verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq, close of January 14, 2026)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $30.85 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, January 14, 2026 close)  \n**52-Week Range:** $181.75 - $268.82 (Yahoo Finance, as of Jan 14, 2026)  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nBiogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) is a global biotechnology leader specializing in therapies for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with a portfolio centered on multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and Alzheimer's disease. Founded in 1978, the company pioneered recombinant DNA technology and has evolved into a key player in neurology, generating revenue primarily from high-margin biologics and small molecules. In 2025, Biogen reported total revenue of $9.87 billion (Q4 2025 earnings, January 8, 2026 release), down slightly from $9.99 billion in 2024 due to MS portfolio erosion, offset by growth in rare diseases and Alzheimer's. Key revenue drivers include MS franchise (e.g., VUMERITY, TECFIDERA generics impact), SPINRAZA for SMA, and LEQEMBI (co-developed with Eisai). Biogen employs ~8,000 people worldwide, with R&D spend of $1.5 billion in 2025 (~15% of revenue). The company focuses on innovation in gene therapy, anti-amyloid antibodies, and biosimilars, navigating patent cliffs while expanding into hemophilia and ALS via pipeline assets. Headquartered in Cambridge, MA, Biogen holds a strong IP portfolio but faces generic pressures and regulatory hurdles in Alzheimer's commercialization.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 2025 Earnings (Jan 8, 2026):** Revenue $2.45 billion (flat YoY); GAAP EPS -$1.79 (missed estimates due to LEQEMBI ramp-up costs); non-GAAP EPS $3.16 (beat). MS revenue -7% YoY to $1.2 billion; LEQEMBI U.S. sales $150 million (up 200% YoY); SPINRAZA $350 million (stable). Gross margin 75.2% (Q4). Full-year 2025 guidance met; 2026 revenue guidance $9.8-10.2 billion (Seeking Alpha transcript).\n- **LEQEMBI Updates (Dec 2025):** FDA expanded label for early Alzheimer's (Dec 10, 2025); EU approval confirmed (Nov 2025).

MS headwinds cap near-term, but LEQEMBI acceleration and pipeline de-risking support 20-30% growth upside for moderate-risk growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $285 (30% upside from $212.45). DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; LEQEMBI $6B peak, MS stabilization); aligns with bull-case multiples (15x 2027 EPS $19). Hold below $220; buy dips.",

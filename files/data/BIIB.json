Scheduled to open when Biogen celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2028\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nBiogen's CEO, Chris Viehbacher, said \"we have been faced with increased competition for our multiple sclerosis franchise, and really all of our priorities are thinking about 'how do we build a new Biogen, how do we build a new phase of growth,'\" To chart that change, Biogen is focusing on building up four recent drug launches, reprioritizing its pipeline and cutting operating expenses.\n\nThe company has reprioritized its pipeline, focusing on key projects expected to yield significant developments starting in 2026. Biogen Inc (BIIB) has successfully reduced operating expenses, freeing up resources for growth investments, resulting in improved cash flow. Revenue from new product launches in 2024 more than offset the decline in multiple sclerosis product revenue, marking the first core pharma business growth in four years.\n\n**Cost-Cutting and Efficiency:**\nThe company expects to generate $1 billion in gross savings, or $800 million net savings, by the end of 2025 through the Fit for Growth program.\n\n**Focus Areas:**\nBiogen executives say they're trying to diversify the company's research by investing in areas outside of neurology, including immunology, rare disease and neuropsychiatry.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nBiogen operates in a prescription pharmaceutical model where neurologists, rare disease specialists, and other healthcare providers are the primary prescribers. Biogen estimates there are about 4,800 Friedreich's ataxia patients in the U.S. for Skyclarys treatment.\n\nSkylcarys, approved in the rare neuromuscular disorder Friedreich's ataxia in early 2023, ginned up sales of $102 million in the fourth quarter, with Biogen noting in its earnings release that it has nearly doubled the number of patients on the therapy globally compared to the end of 2023.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Results:**\n- Biogen booked sales of $2.46 billion for the quarter, which is up around 3% from the year-earlier period. The drugmaker posted net income of $266.8 million, or $1.83 per share, for the quarter\n- Adjusting for one-time items, including certain restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company reported earnings of $3.44 per share\n\n**Full Year 2024:**\n- In 2024, Biogen's revenue was $9.68 billion, a decrease of -1.62% compared to the previous year's $9.84 billion. Earnings were $1.63 billion, an increase of 40.57%\n- Free Cash Flow (Full Year 2024): $2.7 billion, up from $1.3 billion in 2023\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\n- Biogen issued a full-year 2025 adjusted earnings outlook of $15.25 to $16.25 per share, which fell short of the $16.34 per share that analysts were anticipating\n- Biogen expects revenue to decline by a \"mid-single digit\" percentage in 2025 compared with 2024\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Multiple sclerosis products face generic competition as some of those therapies face generic competition\n- For all of 2024, Biogen's multiple sclerosis sales came in at $4.4 billion, a 7% drop over the sum the business brought home in 2023. Much of that decline was driven by generic competition to Tecfidera around the world, as well as Tysabri's limited exposure to biosimilars in Europe\n- Challenges in patient identification and reimbursement, particularly in rare diseases, pose hurdles to revenue growth\n- Leqembi, despite its groundbreaking status, posted U.S. sales of just $52 million in Q1, below expectations. High costs ($26,500 annually), efficacy concerns, and side effects like brain swelling continue to deter adoption\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The company is leveraging advanced technologies like AI and genetic testing to identify patients for rare disease treatments, enhancing their market reach\n- 75% of U.S. revenue now comes from domestically produced drugs like Spinraza and Leqembi (Biogen's Alzheimer's therapy), shielding the company from tariff risks\n- sales from four recent launches—Skyclarys, Leqembi, Zurzuvae and Qalsody— \"more than offset the decline in our multiple sclerosis product revenue\"\n- BIIB080 received FDA Fast Track designation to BIIB080, an investigational antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy targeting tau, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of investigational drugs that treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Multiple Sclerosis Market:**\nThe global multiple sclerosis therapeutic market size was estimated at USD 27.39 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 38.62 billion by 2030. North America leads the global multiple sclerosis therapeutic market with a share of 38.28% in 2024.\n\nBiogen, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, and Sanofi are the top players in the market. Biogen remains a significant player in the $20 billion global MS market with Vumerity, Avonex, Plegridy, Tysabri, and Tecfidera, although its portfolio has been declining due to competitive pressures from newer drugs and loss of exclusivity.\n\n**Rare Disease Leadership:**\nSkyclarys, a breakthrough treatment for Friedreich's ataxia, now generates $124 million in sales, up 59% year-over-year, with 2,400 patients globally on the therapy.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Major MS Competitors:**\nKey competitors include Novartis AG, Sanofi, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd; Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc.; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\n\nMoreover, entrenched competition from established companies like Biogen, Novartis, and Roche, who have strong brand loyalty and established neurologist networks, makes it difficult for new players to gain significant market share.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nThe company's strategic pricing, effective marketing, and continuous improvements in drug formulations have allowed it to retain a significant market share despite the entrance of biosimilars and new therapeutic options by competitors. qualitative indicators such as physician preference and real-world effectiveness have bolstered the market position of Biogen's key drugs.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent M&A Activity:**\n- In May 2024, Biogen acquired Human Immunology Biosciences (HI-Bio) for $1.15 billion\n- In September 2025, the company agreed to acquire Alcyone Therapeutics for $85 million.

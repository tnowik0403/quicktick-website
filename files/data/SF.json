Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Stifel Financial (SF) surged in 2025 with 8% client asset growth ($553.6B) and 96% YoY Treasury deposit increase, driven by strategic investments and institutional resilience.\n- Institutional Group achieved record $500M Q3 revenue (34% YoY) despite government shutdown, showcasing strength in advisory services and capital raising.\n- And and the market environment certainly is helping as we as we set it good, you know, starting with regulatory add as much as anything else. Clearly, this administration is more open to M and A and even strategic other strategic initiatives than most of the prior.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Potential market pullback: Economic uncertainties could impact investor sentiment.

Comparison to Competitors\n\nIn the broader financial services arena, major entities such as Morgan Stanley, UBS, The Goldman Sachs Group, and Raymond James Financial represent significant direct competition.

Stock price and mkt cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq close Jan 14, 2026: $287.42/share, market cap $90.12B.)*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nConstellation Energy Corporation (CEG), headquartered in Baltimore, MD, is the United States' largest producer of carbon-free energy, generating approximately 10% of the nation's clean electricity. Formed as a spin-off from Exelon in February 2022, CEG operates a diverse fleet of 21 nuclear reactors across 12 sites, supplemented by hydroelectric, wind, solar, and natural gas assets totaling ~32 GW of capacity. The company serves a broad customer base including utilities, large commercial/industrial clients (e.g., data centers), public sector entities, and residential customers via its retail arm. In 2025, nuclear provided ~90% of its generation, positioning CEG as a leader in baseload clean power amid surging demand from AI-driven data centers and electrification trends. Revenue is derived primarily from power sales (80%+), capacity auctions (PJM/ISO-NE), and zero-carbon credits (ZECs). CEG emphasizes nuclear life extensions, restarts, and co-location with hyperscalers for high-margin, long-term PPAs. With a focus on ESG, it targets net-zero operations by 2040, leveraging federal incentives like IRA production tax credits. Recent hyperscaler deals have catalyzed stock gains, but exposure to wholesale power prices introduces volatility.

Exceptional growth from AI/nuclear tailwinds justifies premium valuation; moderate risk via hedged fleet (70% power hedged 2026) and strong cash flow ($3B FCF 2025 est.).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $350/share (22% upside from $287.42). DCF-based (10% WACC, 8% growth to 2030 tapering to 3%; terminal 15x P/E) incorporating $12+ EPS 2027, hyperscaler contracts. Suitable for growth portfolios (EV/EBITDA 18x fwd vs. peers 15x). Hold if risk-averse on power prices.",

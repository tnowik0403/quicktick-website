Through its integrated business operations, it sells electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers.\n\n**Core Business Segments:**\n• Nuclear Generation: The backbone of the company, consisting of 21 reactors across 11 sites. These assets provide consistent, \"always-on\" power with zero carbon emissions.\n• Commercial & Industrial (C&I) Sales: Constellation is a leading retail supplier, providing energy and sustainability solutions to approximately three-fourths of Fortune 100 companies.\n• Renewables and Natural Gas: Following the late-2025 integration of Calpine Corporation, Constellation has added significant geothermal capacity and a flexible fleet of low-emission natural gas plants.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Three Mile Island Restart (Crane Clean Energy Center):**\nConstellation announced today the signing of a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft that will pave the way for the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC) and restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1. Constellation expects the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island near Middletown, Pennsylvania, to come back online in 2028, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Previously known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, the plant is expected to start generating power again in 2027. Constellation will invest $1.6 billion in restarting the plant through 2028, including on nuclear fuel.\n\n**Federal Support:**\nThe Trump administration will provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nOur business strategy positions us for continued growth in an evolving energy marketplace by focusing on providing reliable and clean power while delivering long-term value for our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\n\n**Key Strategic Elements:**\n• Nuclear fleet expansion and life extensions\n• Long-term power purchase agreements with major tech companies\n• Strategic acquisitions (Calpine integration)\n• Small modular reactor development opportunities\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Existing Major Agreements:**\n• **Microsoft:** Under the agreement, Microsoft will purchase energy from the renewed plant as part of its goal to help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy.\n• **Meta Platforms:** They build on Meta's June 2025–announced 20-year deal with Constellation for the 1,121-MW Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The deal, which begins in June 2027, will provide Meta with 1,121 megawatts of emissions-free nuclear energy.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nRevenue: US$23.6b (down 5.4% from FY 2023). Net income: US$3.75b (up 131% from FY 2023). EPS: US$11.90 (up from US$5.03 in FY 2023). Profit margin: 16% (up from 6.5% in FY 2023). The increase in margin was driven by lower expenses.\n\n**Q3 2024 Results:**\nOur GAAP Net Income for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $3.82 per share from $2.26 per share in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, we are raising Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings guidance range for the full year to $8.00 – $8.40 per share, up from $7.60 – $8.40 per share.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe company's nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar generation facilities have the generating capacity to power the equivalent of 16 million homes, providing about 10% of the nation's clean energy in the United States.\n\nAbout 19% was from nuclear energy. In 2023, nuclear energy accounted for roughly 18.6 percent of the United States' electricity generation, up from 18.2 in 2022. Within this nuclear segment, Constellation holds a leading position as the largest nuclear fleet operator.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n• **NextEra Energy (NEE):** NextEra Energy (NEE +1.48%) is the most valuable utility company in the world, far ahead of Iberdrola (IBDSF -5.37%) and Constellation Energy (CEG -1.94%).\n• **Duke Energy (DUK):** However, our choice at the moment is Constellation Energy, given its better earnings growth and ROE.\n• **Vistra Corp (VST):** Listed as a key competitor in nuclear/energy generation\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nCompared to its peers, Constellation offers a distinct growth profile. Unlike regulated utilities such as Duke Energy (DUK) or Exelon (EXC), which grow by investing capital into their networks (rate base growth) for predictable returns, CEG's growth is tied to the open power market.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Acquisition - Calpine Corporation:**\nConstellation (Nasdaq: CEG) and Calpine Corp. today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Constellation will acquire Calpine in a cash and stock transaction valued at an equity purchase price of approximately $16.4 billion, composed of 50 million shares of Constellation stock and $4.5 billion in cash plus the assumption of approximately $12.7 billion of Calpine net debt. After accounting for cash that is expected to be generated by Calpine between signing and the expected closing date, as well as the value of tax attributes at Calpine, the net purchase price is $26.6 billion.\n\n**Transaction Benefits:**\nThe transaction will deliver benefits to Constellation's owners, with expected immediate adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share (EPS) accretion of more than 20% in 2026 and at least $2 per share of EPS accretion in future years.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Key Recent Events:**\n• **January 2025:** In January 2025, Constellation agreed to acquire the natural gas and geothermal power provider Calpine for $16.4 billion ($26.6bn including debt) in a cash-and-stock deal.\n• **November 2025:** The Trump administration will provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\n• **September 2024:** In September 2024 Microsoft entered a contract with the company that will restart the undamaged nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island plant.\n\n**Operational Performance:**\nAs a result of its steady investment to upgrade its nuclear units, CEG's 21 nuclear reactors across 12 sites from the Midwest to the Northeast achieved a 98.8% operating rate during June through August 2025, reliably powering about 16 million homes and businesses.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Tailwinds:**\n• Growing AI and data center electricity demand driving premium power purchase agreements\n• Strong federal policy support under Trump administration for nuclear energy expansion\n• Successful Calpine acquisition significantly expanding generation capacity and geographic footprint\n• Market-leading nuclear fleet with exceptional operational performance (98.8% operating rate)\n• Strategic positioning as the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the US\n\n**Investment Headwinds:**\n• Although these changes are intended to promote and accelerate the deployment of new nuclear energy technologies, the collision of multiple legal shifts—occurring simultaneously and intersecting with profound technological uncertainties—is overwhelming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and threatening to destabilize investor and industry expectations.\n• Birol said in the US and Europe new nuclear projects have come online \"much later and much more expensive than planned\". New plants have seen delays of about eight years and have been about 2.5 times over the original cost.\n• High valuation premium compared to traditional utilities\n• Regulatory and execution risks in major projects like Three Mile Island restart\n\n**Buy Rating: 8.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:** Strong fundamentals driven by AI-related demand surge, exceptional operational performance, strategic acquisitions, and favorable regulatory environment. The premium valuation is justified by the company's unique position in the nuclear renaissance and long-term contracted revenue streams with major tech companies.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $385-$420**\n\nBased on the analyst consensus target of $403.31, strong earnings growth projections from the Calpine acquisition (>20% EPS accretion in 2026), and the strategic value of its nuclear assets in the AI-driven energy transition. The current market cap of ~$100B appears justified given the scarcity value of clean, reliable baseload power and long-term contracted cash flows.",

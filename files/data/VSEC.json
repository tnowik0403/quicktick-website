Founded in 1959 and headquartered in Alexandria, VA, VSE operates through three segments: Aviation (55% of Q2 2024 revenue), Fleet (30%), and Federal Services (15%). The Aviation segment supplies OEM/aftermarket parts, repair/overhaul (MRO), and kit solutions for commercial (e.g., Boeing 737/787, Airbus A320) and military aircraft via subsidiaries like VSE Aviation and JETMS. Fleet focuses on medium-duty truck parts distribution through DLS and VAS Aero. Federal Services delivers logistics, engineering, and IT to DoD via primes like Lockheed Martin. With ~1,800 employees, VSE leverages M&A for scale, targeting high-margin aftermarket growth amid supply chain disruptions and aging fleets. Q2 2024 revenue hit $238.9M (up 43.4% YoY), driven by Aviation's 127% surge post-JETMS acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $32.5M (13.6% margin). VSE's niche in hard-to-source parts positions it for resilience in a $90B+ global aviation aftermarket.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 30, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings - Revenue $238.9M (+43.4% YoY), net income $13.4M, Aviation revenue $162.7M (+127% YoY).

DoD budget +4.1% FY2025. | OEM direct competition (Boeing/Airbus); potential aviation downturn if fuel prices spike; labor shortages in MRO. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Aviation (Core Revenue Driver)**: Parts distribution (OEM/PMA), MRO for rotors/engines, chemical kits for Boeing 737/787, Airbus A320, military (C-17, Black Hawk).\n- **Fleet**: Aftermarket parts for Ford F-650 trucks, school buses; e-commerce platform via DLS.\n- **Federal Services**: Supply chain management, engineering for DoD (e.g., F-35 logistics via Lockheed subs).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **737 MAX Enhanced Repairs** (launched Sep 2024): FAA-approved kits for post-2024 grounding fleets; expected $20M+ annual revenue.\n- **A320neo MRO Expansion** (Q4 2024 pilot): Partnership-driven repairs targeting narrowbody surge.\n- **EV Fleet Parts Line** (in development, 2025 launch): Medium-duty electric truck components via Fleet segment.\n- **Digital Logistics Platform** (Federal, beta Q3 2024): AI-driven inventory for DoD primes.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Share**:\n  - U.S. Commercial Aviation Aftermarket Parts/MRO: ~1-2% ($90B global market; VSE ~$400M aviation revenue).\n  - DoD Land Vehicle Logistics: ~3-5% ($20B U.S. segment).\n  - Medium-Duty Truck Aftermarket: ~2% ($15B U.S.).\n- **Forecast (2024-2026)**: Market share growth to 2.5-3.5% in Aviation via M&A/organics (company guide: 20% CAGR); stable/decline risk in Fleet if EV shift accelerates. Overall revenue CAGR 15-20% per mgmt (Q2 call).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric                  | VSEC (Q2 2024) | HEI (Q2 2024) | TDG (Q2 2024) | TGI (Q2 2024) |\n|-------------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Revenue**            | $238.9M       | $955M        | $2.0B        | $352M        |\n| **EBITDA Margin**      | 13.6%         | 32%          | 52%          | 12%          |\n| **YTD Stock Perf.**    | +115%         | +45%         | +60%         | +20%         |\n| **Market Cap**         | $1.35B        | $35B         | $75B         | $1.3B        |\n| **Strengths vs. VSEC** | N/A           | Scale, margins| Pricing power| Structures   |\n| **VSEC Edge**          | Growth rate, M&A agility | Smaller, nimble in kits | Lower valuation (EV/EBITDA 12x vs. 25x+) | Aviation focus |\n\n*Sources: Company 10-Qs (Jul-Sep 2024 filings).

Rationale: 20%+ revenue CAGR potential, undervalued vs. peers (12x 2025 EV/EBITDA vs. sector 20x), Aviation tailwinds outweigh debt risks. Moderate risk via diversified segments.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $115/share (25% upside). DCF-based (15% IRR, 20% CAGR to 2028, 10% terminal multiple) + peers comps, assuming $1B revenue/15% margins by 2026. Hold if risk aversion rises; target catalysts: Q3 earnings (Oct 31 est.), next M&A.",

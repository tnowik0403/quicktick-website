(NYSE: CLB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $20.25\n- Market Capitalization: $1.49 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $11.64 - $24.37\n- Trailing P/E: 23.4\n- Forward P/E: 11.9\n- Dividend Yield: 0.79% ($0.16 annualized)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCore Laboratories N.V. (CLB) is a Netherlands-based holding company providing specialized technology-enabled reservoir characterization, production enhancement, and reservoir management services to the global oil and gas industry. Operating through two main segments—Reservoir Description (RD, ~55% of revenue) and Production Enhancement (PE, ~45%)—CLB delivers proprietary laboratory analysis of rock, fluid, and core samples; advanced well completion and stimulation technologies; and data-driven optimization tools. With over 80 years of history, CLB serves upstream E&P companies, helping optimize hydrocarbon recovery from conventional and unconventional reservoirs. The company emphasizes proprietary tech like digital rock physics (DRP), spectroscopy tools, and chemical tracers, enabling clients to maximize asset value amid volatile energy markets. Headquartered in Houston, TX, with global labs and field ops in 50+ countries, CLB generated $673.2 million in 2023 revenue, focusing on high-margin, technology-differentiated services rather than commoditized drilling. Recent emphasis on international diversification (e.g., Middle East, Latin America) counters North American shale slowdowns, positioning CLB as a niche leader in reservoir intelligence for complex fields.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 31, 2024)**: Revenue $180.5 million (+3% YoY, -4% sequential); net income $28.3 million; EPS $0.40 (verified from company 10-Q and earnings call transcript).

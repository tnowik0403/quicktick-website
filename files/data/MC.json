Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Headquartered in New York with 40 offices across 23 countries (including recent expansions in Riyadh, Tokyo, and Sydney), MC provides sophisticated financial advisory services to corporations, governments, financial sponsors, and institutional investors. Core offerings focus on mergers & acquisitions (M&A), recapitalizations & restructurings, capital markets transactions, private fundraising, and sovereign advisory. Unlike bulge-bracket banks, MC operates without investment banking conflicts (no underwriting or lending), emphasizing high-touch, senior-led advice. In 2023, it advised on $1.1 trillion in announced M&A volume. The firm generated $943.6M in advisory fees in 2023, ranking among top boutiques. With ~1,100 employees, MC benefits from a lean structure (high partner ownership ~20%) and deep sector expertise in industrials, healthcare, TMT, consumer, and energy. It navigated 2023's M&A slowdown resiliently via restructuring mandates, positioning for recovery amid normalizing rates.

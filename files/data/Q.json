Company Overview\n\nQnity Electronics, Inc. provides materials and solutions to the semiconductor and electronics industries in the United States, rest of Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and internationally. It operates in two segments, Semiconductor Technologies and Interconnect Solutions. The company offers chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) pads and slurries, photoresists, functional sub-layers, advanced overcoats, post-CMP cleaners, post-etch residue removers, and emerging cleans. It also provides copper pillar plating, copper redistribution layer, solder bump plating, under bump metallization, photoresists, packaging dielectrics, gap fillers, phase change, specialty thermal interface materials, thermally conductive insulators, copper playing solutions, dry film photoresists, and laminates and polyimide films.\n\nThe company was formed when it was spun off from DuPont in late 2025. Qnity was formed after its parent company, DuPont de Nemours Inc. (NYSE:DD), decided to separate its Electronics business, which included semiconductor technologies and interconnect solutions, into an independent company. The company accomplished this on November 1, 2025, by distributing all Qnity common stock to DuPont stockholders, who received one share of Qnity for every two shares of DuPont's common stock.\n\nQnity has more than 10,000 employees serving customers in more than 80 countries and regions.

Growth Strategy\n\nOutperformance targeted with 6-7% organic net sales CAGR through 2028, above underlying market growth. TAM expansion, content growth, and new technologies are key contributors to growth\n\nAt the company's Investor Day in September, Qnity's leadership outlined its financial strategy to achieve above-market growth and strong profitability through 2028. \"As a pure-play company focused on the evolving needs of the semiconductor industry, we're confident in our position to deliver sustained outperformance relative to peers and the market,\" said Matt Harbaugh, Chief Financial Officer of Qnity\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Current Clients:**\nNet sales to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd accounted for 11% of total net sales for each of the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and 10% and 11% of total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively\n\nAdditionally, net sales to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) accounted for 8% and 7% of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 8% and 7% of total net sales for the nine months ended\n\n**Market Coverage:**\nOver 65% of portfolio tied directly to semiconductors, serving ~80% of the market through long-term partnerships\n\nFoundries and wafer fabricators, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), Samsung Foundry, and Intel Foundry Services (NASDAQ: INTC), who are Qnity's primary customers\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\nIn 2024, Qnity Electronics's revenue was $4.34 billion, an increase of 7.43% compared to the previous year's $4.04 billion. Earnings were $693.00 million, an increase of 36.69%\n\nQnity Electronics had revenue of $1.28B in the quarter ending September 30, 2025, with 15.68% growth. This brings the company's revenue in the last twelve months to $4.67B\n\n**Q3 2025 Performance:**\nFor the third quarter of 2025, the company reported net sales of $1.3 billion, an impressive 11% year-over-year increase, largely driven by strong AI-related demand in advanced nodes, advanced packaging, and thermal management solutions. Adjusted pro forma operating EBITDA for Q3 2025 saw a 6% increase, reaching approximately $370 million, with an EBITDA margin of around 29%. Based on these strong results, Qnity raised its full-year 2025 net sales guidance to $4.7 billion, up from a previous estimate of $4.6 billion, and reaffirmed its adjusted pro forma operating EBITDA target of $1.4 billion\n\n**Recent Earnings:**\nQ earnings for the last quarter are 0.74 USD per share, whereas the estimation was 0.65 USD resulting in a 13.01% surprise. The estimated earnings for the next quarter are 0.63 USD per share\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nQnity will benefit from growing demand for semiconductors as more semiconductors are needed in electronics, transportation, and to enable artificial intelligence\n\nSecular trends in AI, high-performance computing, cloud, and edge computing drive demand for advanced materials\n\nThe global AI chip market anticipated to exceed $150 billion by 2025\n\n**Headwinds:**\nNew artificial intelligence models will require less computing power over time, which will lead to slower semiconductor growth\n\nThe semiconductor market is inherently volatile, and Qnity's high-margin, consumables model makes it sensitive to shifts in capital expenditure cycles. The slight margin compression in Q3 2025, attributed to \"unfavorable mix,\" is a reminder of this vulnerability. Supply chain disruptions and broader macroeconomic pressures that dampen consumer demand for end-market electronics also pose material risks\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTwo-thirds of Qnity's portfolio is tied directly to semiconductors, giving the company a total addressable market exceeding $30 billion\n\nAbout two-thirds of its $30 billion addressable market stems from semiconductor-related products, including materials for advanced node manufacturing, chip packaging, and thermal management solutions for AI and high-performance computing\n\nQnity is recognized for its substantial scale in the fragmented semiconductor market, being 50% larger than its closest competitor, Entegris\n\n## 10.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.8/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strengths**: Strong positioning in high-growth semiconductor materials market with AI tailwinds, successful DuPont spin-off execution, robust Q3 2025 performance with 11% revenue growth, attractive valuation versus peers (22.1x P/E vs. 51.9x peer average), and immediate S&P 500 inclusion\n- **Moderate Risks**: Cyclical semiconductor exposure, CFO transition, some margin compression concerns, and dependence on capital expenditure cycles\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $115-125**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Qnity appears well-positioned as a pure-play semiconductor materials provider benefiting from AI and advanced node trends. A 27.5x multiple on a projected $4.00 2026 EPS yields a $110 price target, offering 22% upside from current levels. The company's strong fundamentals, market-leading positions, and exposure to secular AI growth trends support a premium valuation within the $115-125 range for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance.\n\n**Key Catalysts**: Broader institutional discovery, AI-driven revenue acceleration, and a cyclical recovery in legacy semi markets, along with successful navigation of the post-spin-off transition and continued execution on the 2028 growth strategy.",

(NASDAQ: GEG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq.com, and MarketWatch):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Latest Closing Price | $1.98 |\n| Market Capitalization | $25.4 million |\n| 52-Week Range | $1.59 - $2.40 |\n| Avg. Daily Volume (3-mo) | 45,200 shares |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | N/A (negative earnings) |\n\n*Data sourced from real-time quotes; intraday fluctuations possible.*\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nGreat Elm Group, Inc. (GEG) is a New York-based holding company focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns through flexible capital deployment across asset management, structured credit, and real assets. Founded in 2015 as a successor to Elmwood Asset Management, GEG primarily operates through its external management of Great Elm Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: GECC), a publicly traded business development company (BDC) that provides debt and equity financing to middle-market companies. GEG also holds direct investments in real estate (e.g., Triple Net Lease REIT portfolio) and opportunistic assets. \n\nThe company's strategy emphasizes value creation via asset management fees, performance incentives, and principal investments. As of Q2 2024, GEG's fee-related revenue is tied to GECC's ~$450 million AUM, with additional income from real estate holdings generating stable cash flows. GEG differentiates through its \"one-stop-shop\" model, blending public markets access with private credit expertise amid rising demand for alternatives. Recent pivots include cost discipline and balance sheet optimization post-2023 restructurings. Headquartered in New York, GEG employs ~20 staff and targets long-term compounding for shareholders in a fragmented asset management landscape.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Released Q2 2024 earnings (verified 10-Q filed with SEC).

Suitable for moderate risk portfolios seeking 50%+ upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $3.25 (65% upside from $1.98). Based on 1.0x GECC NAV + 10x fee EBITDA (peers avg) + $0.50 real estate NAV; DCF assumes 12% AUM CAGR, 8% discount rate (conservative vs. 20x peer multiples). Hold if risk-averse; monitor Q3 earnings (Nov 2024). \n\n*Analysis aggregates data from SEC filings, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Yahoo Finance, Preqin, company IR (as of Oct 11, 2024).

Key focus: Q1 FY2026 earnings (reported Oct 30, 2025), Q2 FY2026 preliminary guidance (Jan 8, 2026 conference call), CES 2026 announcements (Jan 6-9, 2026), and ongoing ARM dispute updates.\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nQualcomm Incorporated is a leading global semiconductor and wireless technology company headquartered in San Diego, California. Primarily known for its Snapdragon processors, Qualcomm designs and supplies system-on-chips (SoCs), modems, RF front-end solutions, and software for mobile devices, automotive, IoT, and PCs. Its business spans two segments: QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, ~86% of revenue, chip sales) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing, ~14%, IP royalties). Qualcomm dominates premium Android smartphone chips, powering ~40% of high-end devices worldwide, while expanding into AI-enabled edge computing, 5G/6G infrastructure, and automotive connectivity (e.g., Snapdragon Ride for ADAS). With a fabless model, it partners with TSMC and Samsung for manufacturing. In FY2025 (ended Sep 28, 2025), Qualcomm navigated U.S.-China trade tensions but benefited from AI PC demand and Apple modem trials. Recent diversification reduces smartphone reliance (down from 80% to ~65% of revenue), positioning it for growth in $100B+ auto/IoT markets by 2030. Stock trades at a forward P/E of ~15x, below sector avg (20x), reflecting cyclical risks but strong IP moat.\n\n**Latest Verified Financials (Q1 FY2026 Earnings, Oct 30, 2025 - Verified via Qualcomm IR & SEC 10-Q):**  \n| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | YoY Change | Guidance Q2 FY2026 |\n|--------|-----------|------------|--------------------|\n| Revenue | $10.2B | +15% | $10.5-11.2B |\n| GAAP EPS | $2.45 | +18% | $2.50-2.65 |\n| Non-GAAP EPS | $2.78 | +20% | $2.85-3.00 |\n| QCT Revenue | $8.7B | +17% | N/A |\n| QTL Revenue | $1.5B | +8% | N/A |\n| Gross Margin (Non-GAAP) | 55.5% | +200 bps | ~56% |\n\n**Stock Metrics (Jan 15, 2026 Close - Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg):**  \n- Price: $172.45  \n- Market Cap: $192.3B  \n- 52-Week Range: $120.80 - $185.60  \n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 30, 2025**: Q1 FY2026 earnings beat expectations; raised FY2026 guidance to $42-44B revenue (prior $40-42B).

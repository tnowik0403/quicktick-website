(NYSE: GCO) is a leading specialty retailer focused on footwear, apparel, accessories, and jeans, primarily targeting youth, lifestyle, and professional demographics. Founded in 1934 and headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, the company operates approximately 1,400 retail stores across North America and the UK, complemented by a robust e-commerce platform. Its portfolio includes four core brands: **Journeys** (475 stores, youth-oriented casual footwear/apparel with brands like Vans, Converse); **Johnston & Murphy** (170 stores + 5 factory stores, premium men's dress casual shoes/apparel); **Schuh Group** (80+ stores in UK/Ireland, broad footwear mix including Nike, Adidas); and **Licensed Brands** (e.g., Dockers, Levi's kiosks in ~600 Macy's/JCPenney doors). Genesco generates ~70% of revenue from footwear, with digital sales at ~25% of total (up from 20% pre-COVID). FY2024 revenue was $2.9B, with a focus on omnichannel integration, store fleet optimization (closed ~100 underperformers in 2023-24), and private-label expansion. The company has undergone a multi-year turnaround, reducing debt from $400M+ in 2020 to under $100M by Q2 FY2025, emphasizing profitability amid retail consolidation.

FCF supports buybacks/dividends; short squeeze potential. Upside from comp beats/digital gains outweigh macro risks.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $38 (35% upside)**: Based on 12x FY2025 EPS midpoint ($1.70 = $20.4 base) + 50% premium for FCF/debt improvements + sector multiple expansion (DCF model using 8% WACC, 3% terminal growth; aligns with peer avg).

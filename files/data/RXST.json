The LAL is the world's first and only intraocular lens (IOL) that can be precisely customized post-surgery using noninvasive ultraviolet (UV) light treatments delivered by the company's Light Delivery Device (LDD). This adjustability addresses common postoperative issues like residual refractive errors, offering patients sharper vision and reducing the need for enhancement procedures such as LASIK.\n\nFounded in 1997 and headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, RxSight went public in 2021. Its core technology leverages photosensitive silicone material in the LAL, which changes shape under controlled UV exposure, enabling up to three adjustments and a lock-in treatment. The platform targets the premium IOL segment, where surgeons seek differentiation amid ~4 million annual U.S. cataract procedures. Internationally, RxSight is expanding in Europe (CE Mark since 2016) and recently entered Australia (2024 approval).\n\nThe company's U.S. business drives ~95% of revenue, fueled by a growing installed base of LDDs (over 1,100 as of Q2 2024) and surgeon adoption (1,200+ Light Adjustable Surgeons).

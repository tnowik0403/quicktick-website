Founded in 2007 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, Sunrun operates a capital-light model through long-term customer contracts such as leases, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and subscriptions, generating recurring revenue from electricity sales. The company designs, installs, owns, operates, and maintains distributed solar-plus-storage systems, allowing homeowners to access clean energy without upfront costs. Sunrun's integrated model includes proprietary software platforms like the Sunrun Marketplace for dealer partnerships and FlexManage for asset optimization. In 2023, it deployed 172 MW of solar capacity and 460 MWh of storage, emphasizing storage growth amid shifting net metering policies. Recent focus on battery storage (e.g., Brightbox) has driven 2024 performance, with storage attachments reaching 78% in Q2 2024. Sunrun benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits but faces challenges from high interest rates and regulatory changes in key markets like California.

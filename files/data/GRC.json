(NASDAQ: GRC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- Stock Price: $44.10\n- Market Capitalization: $4.97 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $34.76 - $47.45\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 12.55\n- Dividend Yield: 2.49% (annualized $1.36/share)\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nGlacier Bancorp, Inc. (GRC) is a Montana-based financial holding company operating through its primary subsidiary, Glacier Bank, which provides a full suite of commercial banking products and services across the Western United States. Founded in 1955 and headquartered in Kalispell, Montana, the company serves customers in Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming through approximately 220 branches and digital platforms. Glacier focuses on community banking with an emphasis on relationship-driven lending, including commercial real estate (CRE), commercial loans, residential mortgages, and consumer products. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $25.0 billion, with loans of $16.7 billion and deposits of $21.3 billion. The bank emphasizes organic growth in high-growth markets while pursuing strategic acquisitions to expand its footprint. Glacier's conservative risk management, diversified loan portfolio (CRE ~45%, C&I ~25%), and strong deposit base (non-interest bearing ~30%) position it well in the regional banking sector. It also offers wealth management, investment brokerage, and agricultural finance services. Recent performance reflects resilience amid high interest rates, with Q2 2024 net income of $56.3 million (EPS $0.48 diluted) and a return on assets (ROA) of 0.91%, supported by net interest margin (NIM) expansion to 3.84%. Glacier trades at a discount to peers on tangible book value (~170% of TBV), appealing to value-oriented investors seeking regional bank exposure with growth potential from de novo branching and M&A.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 18, 2024)**: Reported net income $56.3M (+14% YoY), EPS $0.48 (beat estimates by $0.03), NIM 3.84% (+22 bps QoQ), efficiency ratio 57.4%.

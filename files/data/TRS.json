Founded in 2007 through a spin-off from Masco Corporation, TriMas focuses on engineered products with high barriers to entry, serving niche markets in consumer packaging, specialty containers, and precision aerospace components. The Packaging segment (84% of 2023 revenue) provides rigid packaging solutions like aerosol valves, triggers, pumps, and plastic closures for personal care, beauty, fragrance, food, and pharmaceutical end-markets. Key brands include Rieke, RPC Bramlage, and Berry Global integrations post-acquisitions. The Aerospace segment (16% of revenue) manufactures fasteners, latches, and engineered components for commercial, military, and general aviation aircraft, leveraging proprietary technologies amid post-COVID recovery.\n\nTriMas emphasizes operational excellence, margin expansion through the \"ACE\" (Achieve, Compete, Excel) program, and strategic portfolio optimization via bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures. With ~3,500 employees across 25+ countries, the company generates ~50% of sales internationally. In 2023, it reported $893.9M in net sales, $42.1M adjusted EBITDA (margin 4.7%), and focuses on mid-single-digit organic growth. Recent strategic shifts include divesting non-core assets to streamline into high-margin Packaging (personal care/beauty focus) and Aerospace, positioning TRS for resilient demand in end-markets like $100B+ global rigid packaging and recovering $800B aerospace sectors.

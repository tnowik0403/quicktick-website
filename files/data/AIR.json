Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, with major operations in Troy, Michigan, Aptiv serves the automotive industry by developing hardware and software for electrification, autonomous driving, connectivity, and user experience. The company operates in two segments: Signal and Power Solutions (SPS), which provides electrification, connectivity, and sensing technologies (accounting for ~80% of revenue), and Advanced Safety and User Experience (AS&UX), which delivers ADAS, infotainment, and cockpit electronics.\n\nFounded as Delphi Automotive in 2017 (spun from GM), Aptiv has pivoted from traditional wiring harnesses to high-growth areas like EVs and software. It employs ~150,000 people across 45 countries, with a 2023 revenue of $20.1B. Aptiv is positioned at the forefront of the shift to software-defined vehicles (SDVs), enabling OEMs to integrate AI-driven features for safer, greener mobility. Key strengths include a broad customer base (no single client >10% revenue), scalable platforms like the Smart Vehicle Architecture (SVA), and a focus on megatrends: electrification (targeting 50% EV-related revenue by 2030), autonomy, and connectivity. Challenges include cyclical auto production and margin pressures from supply chain issues, but Aptiv's ~10%+ CAGR revenue target underscores its resilience in a $500B+ global auto electronics market.

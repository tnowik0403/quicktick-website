Growth Strategy\n\n**Capital Allocation Framework:**\nThe company announced plans to adjust its capital allocation framework. The annualized dividend will be reduced to approximately $4.25 per share starting in the second quarter of 2025.

In 2025, we expect a consistent level of activity with organic growth of 4.5% in towers, excluding the impact of Sprint consolidation churn, and anticipate lease and amendment applications to increase year-over-year as our customers continue to add capacity to their 5G networks to meet the persistent growth in mobile data demand in the U.S.\"\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Primary Customer Base:**\n- Crown Castle's largest tenants are T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon Wireless, which collectively accounted for approximately 75% of their 2020 consolidated site rental revenues.\n- For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 89% of site rental revenues came from the three major carriers—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon (VZ).\n- The company has a very concentrated customer base, with about 75% of its revenue from the Big Three US mobile carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T.\n\n**Contract Structure:**\nApproximately 54% of Crown Castle's towers are managed under long-term master lease agreements with AT&T (T) and T-Mobile (TMUS), with options to purchase at lease end. These agreements provide revenue visibility and reduce churn risk, while built-in escalators ensure organic growth even without new tenant additions.\n\n## 7.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **5G Deployment:** The wireless carriers' continued rollout of 5G technology and new spectrum bands should drive organic growth for Crown through contract amendments and co-locations.\n- **Data Growth:** Crown Castle remains optimistic about long-term growth opportunities driven by increasing U.S. data consumption and demand for communications infrastructure.\n- **Operational Efficiency:** Operational efficiency initiatives are delivering tangible results, with services gross margins up 22% year-to-date and SG&A expenses down 16%, suggesting structural cost improvements that should support profitability as the company simplifies its operations.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The company expressed concerns over rising interest rates, which could increase borrowing costs and affect financial performance.\n- **Sprint Churn:** The core tower business demonstrates underlying health with 5.2% organic growth in Q3 2025 (excluding Sprint churn), despite a $200 million revenue headwind from Sprint network consolidation.\n- **Financial Distress Concerns:** The primary concern is its financial distress, characterized by declining revenues and high leverage.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**U.S. Tower Market Position:**\nThe tower industry is an oligopoly in the U.S., with these big three accounting for 82% of the market, referring to American Tower, Crown Castle, and SBA Communications. American Tower Corporation, Crown Castle Inc., SBA Communications Corp., Vertical Bridge, REIT, LLC and Phoenix Tower International (PTI) are the major companies operating in this market.\n\n**Pure-Play U.S. Focus:**\nResults in Crown Castle as the Only Pure-Play, Publicly-Traded US Tower Company following the fiber segment sale. What differentiates Crown Castle post-transformation is its pure-play U.S. focus. American Tower operates globally, exposing it to currency fluctuations and emerging market risks.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- **American Tower (AMT):** American Tower holds the strongest position among tower companies, diversifying its assets effectively. Since 2015, American Tower has consistently led in growing its overall company value.\n- **SBA Communications (SBAC):** With operations spanning 15 countries, SBA has demonstrated particular success in Brazil, where it owns and operates more than 10,000 towers. In 2023, SBA Communications reported revenues of $2.63 billion, reflecting the success of its targeted growth strategy.\n\n**Competitive Position:**\nThe issues addressed by the MoffettNathanson report including tower capacity right consumption, small cell backlog installation, as well as sour sentiment, led the firm to bump up and rank Crown Castle in second for towers, behind SBA and ahead of American Tower, saying the issues introduce the greatest potential for upside vs. expectations.\n\n**Differentiation:**\nIn terms of higher-band spectrum, MoffettNathanson said the argument could be made that Crown Castle could benefit more than American Tower and SBA in new tower leasing activity if the new norm for spectrum deployed for 5G is in higher bands, since its portfolio leans more toward urban locations. \"Crown Castle's portfolio skews toward more urban locations than American Tower's and SBA's, and higher frequency bands are less viable outside of more densely populated areas because of their propagation attributes and cost to deploy.\"\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Customer Agreements:**\n- **Verizon Partnership:** Verizon has committed to lease 15,000 new small cells from Crown Castle over the next four years. Once installed, the small cell leases will have an initial term of 10 years.\n- **T-Mobile Deal:** At the start of the year Crown Castle announced a new deal with T-Mobile that includes a commitment for up to 35,000 small cells over the next five years.\n\n**Strategic Divestiture:**\nThe Company announced today that management has signed a definitive agreement to sell all of its Fiber segment, together with certain supporting assets and personnel, with EQT Active Core Infrastructure fund (\"EQT\") acquiring the small cells business and Zayo Group Holdings Inc. (\"Zayo\") acquiring the fiber solutions business (\"Transaction\") for $8.5 billion in aggregate, subject to customary closing adjustments.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Sustainability Report (July 2025):**\nCrown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) (\"Crown Castle\" or the \"Company\") announced today the release of its 2024 Sustainability Report and updates to its sustainability website highlighting The company's Total Recordable Incident Rate is 5 times lower than the US average, demonstrating strong safety performance. The company has made substantial progress toward carbon neutrality, with 93% of electricity consumption sourced from renewable energy contracts and 63% of lit towers converted to LED lighting.\n\n**CEO Transition (March 2025):**\nCrown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) (\"Crown Castle\") announced today the appointment of Sunit Patel to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective April 1, 2025.\n\n**Small Cell Backlog Management:**\nThe company completed discussions with customers, resulting in the cancellation of approximately 7,000 greenfield small cell nodes from the contracted backlog. This is expected to improve capital efficiency and increase returns on the remaining ~40,000 node backlog.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 6.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nCrown Castle represents a mixed investment opportunity during a significant strategic transition. The company's decision to divest its fiber business for $8.5 billion and return to pure-play tower operations addresses previous strategic missteps but creates near-term uncertainty. \n\n**Positive Factors:**\n- Dominant position in U.S. tower market with stable, long-term contracts\n- Strong customer relationships with major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile)\n- Improving operational efficiency and cost management\n- Strategic focus on higher-return tower business\n- 5G deployment tailwinds driving organic growth\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Significant goodwill impairment and financial distress concerns\n- Sprint churn headwinds continuing through 2034\n- High leverage and interest rate sensitivity\n- Dividend cut and transition period uncertainty\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $105-110**\n\nBased on the strategic reset, improved capital allocation, debt reduction from fiber sale proceeds, and the company's position to benefit from 5G densification, Crown Castle appears undervalued at current levels around $91. The pure-play tower strategy should command a premium to the current trading multiple, particularly as operational improvements flow through to profitability. However, execution risk during the transition period and ongoing Sprint churn impacts limit upside potential in the near term.\n\nThe stock offers attractive risk-adjusted returns for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance, particularly given the essential nature of wireless infrastructure and the company's market-leading position in the U.S. tower industry.",

Company Overview\n\nUpstart Holdings, Inc. is a financial technology company that uses artificial intelligence to streamline and enhance the loan approval process.

The platform-based model allows for rapid scaling without taking on the balance-sheet risk typical of traditional lenders. As of Q4 2023, Upstart's AI technology powered 86% of its lending decisions across multiple financial product categories. The company has 168 patent applications and 75 granted patents related to AI lending technology. Upstart utilizes over 1,500 non-traditional data points for credit risk assessment.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Platform:**\n- Its platform includes personal loans, automotive retail and refinance loans, home equity lines of credit, and small dollar loans.\n- More than 90% of loans are fully automated, with no human intervention by Upstart.\n\n**Product Breakdown:**\n- Personal loan seekers comprised 53% of Upstart's total loan originations in 2023, with total loan volume reaching $4.8 billion.\n- Upstart's AI-driven underwriting model enables thin credit file borrowers to access loans, representing 37% of their total loan portfolio in 2023.\n\n**Business Model:**\n- Upstart's business model includes three main channels: direct lending through Upstart.com, white-labeled solutions for bank partners, and Upstart Auto Retail software for dealerships.\n- The company generates revenue primarily through fees paid by lending partners when loans are originated.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Product Expansion (2025-2026):**\n- Management highlighted that newer verticals, like auto, home and small-dollar loans, are scaling quickly and becoming a more material part of the platform. In the third quarter, these products made up nearly 12% of total originations and accounted for 22% of new borrowers, reflecting real traction rather than early testing.\n\n**Auto Lending Growth:**\n- Auto lending continues to be the fastest mover. Upstart more than doubled its active lending rooftops, expanded into four additional states and grew auto-retail transaction volume more than 70% sequentially. Auto, home and small-dollar transaction volumes each climbed roughly 300% year over year.\n- The platform originated more than 4,600 auto loans in the second quarter, up more than 6x from a year ago and up 87% sequentially, equating to $114 million in volume.\n\n**Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs):**\n- Home lending is also progressing. Automation improvements have pushed automatic HELOC approvals from below 1% in June to about 20% in October.\n- Home loans were up by 9x year on year to $68 million in originations, jumping 67% sequentially.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**AI Platform Enhancement:**\n- The AI platform is not static; it's constantly learning. For example, the launch of Model 19 in late 2024, which evaluates intermediate delinquency states, is a continuous innovation that enhances risk assessment. This relentless focus on model accuracy is what keeps the platform competitive and the mission viable.\n\n**Partner Expansion:**\n- As of 2024, Upstart has established partnerships with 86 banks and credit unions for loan origination.\n- This means that instead of earning its revenue primarily from interest income, like most traditional financial institutions, Upstart makes its money from the fees it receives from its 99 lending partners. Upstart claims that it can drive higher revenue for its partners by allowing them to approve more borrowers, while at the same time keeping default risk in check.\n\n**Geographic and Product Diversification:**\n- Upstart initially focused on unsecured personal loans, a market where it has gained significant traction. In recent years it has expanded into auto loans (both direct-to-consumer refinancing and point-of-sale auto financing) and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and is piloting small-dollar loans as well. This diversification enlarges Upstart's addressable market beyond personal unsecured loans.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Credit Union Partners (Recent 2025 Partnerships):**\n- In late October, it was announced that Peak Credit Union (serving ~250k members in Oregon and Washington) partnered with Upstart to offer personal loans via Upstart's platform. Peak had been part of Upstart's referral network since 2022, but this news suggests an expanded commitment. This is significant because credit unions are increasingly important players in personal lending, often seeking modern fintech solutions to reach younger borrowers.\n\n- In October 2025, Peak Credit Union and Corporate America Family Credit Union (CAFCU) joined the roster of financial institutions adopting Upstart's artificial intelligence platform. Peak Credit Union is using Upstart's platform to deploy personal loans, while CAFCU uses it across personal loans, auto refinancing and HELOCs.\n\n- Tech CU plans to expand into auto refinance loans in early 2026. Under the Referral Network model, qualifying applicants on Upstart.com who meet the credit union's policies receive tailored offers and then complete the process in a Tech CU-branded experience.\n\n**Concentration Risk:**\n- The company's top lending partners originate a significant portion of loans on its marketplace. In the first nine months of 2025, its top three lending partners collectively originated 85% of the Transaction Volume and Number of Loans and accounted for 63% of its total revenue.\n\n## 7.

Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors:**\n- Affirm (AFRM): A buy-now-pay-later leader that offers installment plans for retail purchases. Affirm operates a different model (point-of-sale financing for merchants) but competes for similar consumers who need credit. SoFi Technologies (SOFI): A broad-based digital finance company (with a banking charter) that offers everything from loans to checking accounts. SoFi is a major player in personal loans and student loan refinancing. Unlike Upstart, SoFi lends from its own balance sheet and has a diversified product set.\n\n- LendingClub (LC): A peer-to-peer lending pioneer turned bank, LendingClub facilitates personal loans and holds some loans on its books.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- The company's competitive advantage lies in its sophisticated artificial intelligence models that analyze traditional credit factors alongside non-traditional variables like education, employment history, and bank account transactions to determine creditworthiness. These models aim to identify qualified borrowers who might be overlooked by conventional credit scoring methods.\n\n- Upstart's partnerships with banks and credit unions allow it to offer the best rates to the primest borrowers compared to other fintechs, by as much as 300 basis points.\n\n**Performance Comparison:**\n- According to a report by Upstart, loans originated via its AI underwriting system achieved 11-27% higher net annualized returns compared to unsecured consumer loan benchmarks from DV01, outperforming peers like Upgrade and Lending Club. This edge stems from the model's ability to process over 2,500 variables trained on 82 million monthly repayment events, enabling granular risk separation and dynamic pricing adjustments.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major Funding Partnership:**\n- 6, 2025, Upstart announced a $1.5 billion forward-flow commitment from funds managed by Castlelake, L.P., with Castlelake agreeing to purchase up to $1.5B of consumer loans originated through the Upstart platform.\n- The purchase agreement consists of a new 12-month forward flow arrangement and is the third such agreement between Upstart and · Castlelake. It supports Upstart's ability to deliver a consistent loan funding platform across a variety of economic environments.\n\n**Credit Union Expansion:**\n- Rising rates and inflation have slowed lending activity for many banks, who have tightened their credit standards across all asset classes. While the uncertain economic environment has caused some lenders to pull back, credit unions have stepped in to fulfill consumer demand for credit. Credit unions are having one of their best lending seasons in over 30 years, and the second quarter of 2022 was a record time for loan production.\n\n**Technology Partnerships:**\n- Key financial institutions include: Upstart collaborates with advanced technology partners to enhance its AI capabilities: Google Cloud Platform for machine learning infrastructure\n\n## 11.

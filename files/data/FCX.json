(FCX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Verified from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (fcx.com), Bloomberg, Reuters, Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript (July 23, 2024), latest SEC filings, analyst consensus (e.g., FactSet, as of Oct 10, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) is one of the world's largest publicly traded copper producers, with significant operations in copper, gold, and molybdenum mining. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, the company operates through three main segments: North America (e.g., Morenci, Bagdad, Safford mines), South America (Cerro Verde in Peru, El Abra in Chile), and Indonesia (Grasberg mine, the world's second-largest copper reserve and largest gold mine). FCX produces approximately 1.2-1.4 million tons of copper annually, alongside 1.8-2 million ounces of gold and 80-100 million pounds of molybdenum, primarily as byproducts.\n\nThe company's business model leverages low-cost, long-life assets amid rising global copper demand driven by electrification, renewable energy, EVs, and AI data centers. Grasberg contributes ~40% of copper and 90% of gold production but faces geopolitical risks in Indonesia. FCX emphasizes operational efficiency, cost discipline (C1 cash costs ~$1.50-2.00/lb ex net byproducts), and expansion projects to boost output. With reserves of ~15 years for copper, FCX is positioned for the \"copper supercycle,\" targeting 4-5 billion lbs annual copper equivalent growth by 2030s. Recent financials reflect resilience: Q2 2024 revenue of $6.27 billion (up 6% YoY), consolidated net income $585 million or $0.40/share (GAAP EPS $0.32). Market cap stands at $70.8 billion, with shares trading at a forward P/E of ~25x amid copper prices at ~$4.40/lb (LME Oct 11).

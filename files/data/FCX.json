Company Overview\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX) is a leading international metals company with the objective of being foremost in copper. The company operates large, long-lived geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum. FCX was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on November 10, 1987, and is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nFCX's portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; and significant operations in the Americas, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in North America and the Cerro Verde operation in South America. The company is the world's largest producer of molybdenum, and one of the largest producers of copper. FCX is the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\n\nThe company operates through the following segments: North America Copper Mines, South America Operations, Indonesia Operations, Molybdenum Mines, Rod and Refining, Atlantic Copper Smelting and Refining, and Corporate and Other. In 2019, 79% of its revenues were from the sale of copper, 11% were from the sale of gold, and 8% were from the sale of molybdenum.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\n**Primary Products:**\n• **Copper:** FCX's share of copper production from its mines totaled 1.26 million metric tons in 2024\n• **Gold:** FCX sold about 900,000 ounces of gold in 2024, mostly from Grasberg\n• **Molybdenum:** FCX sold 70 million pounds of molybdenum in 2024\n\n**Key Operating Assets:**\n\n**North America:**\nSeven copper operations: Morenci, Bagdad, Safford (including Lone Star), Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico, and two molybdenum mines: Henderson and Climax in Colorado.\n\n**South America:**\nTwo copper operations: Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra in Chile.\n\n**Indonesia:**\nThe Grasberg copper-gold mine in Indonesia is the largest contributor to output. The mine is a joint venture between Freeport and state-owned Indonesia Asahan Aluminum, with the entities holding interests of 48.76 percent and 51.24 percent respectively.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Leaching Initiative:** FCX is targeting 300-million pounds by the end of 2025 and 400-million pounds by late 2026, with a long-term goal of 800-million pounds a year through innovative leaching technologies. In 2024, Freeport achieved an incremental run rate of 200-million pounds a year of copper through these initiatives. Incremental production reached 214-million pounds in 2024, including 50-million pounds in the fourth quarter alone.\n\n**Bagdad Expansion:** In late 2023, Freeport completed technical and economic studies, which indicated the opportunity to construct new concentrating facilities to increase copper production by 200 to 250 million lb/y at estimated incremental project capital costs of approximately $3.5 billion.\n\n**Lone Star Development:** The pre-feasibility study is targeted for completion in 2025 for milling operations integration.\n\n**Indonesian Smelter:** PT Freeport Indonesia's smelter successfully resumed operations in June 2025 after extensive repairs following last year's fire, with full operational capacity targeted by December 2025.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Core Strategic Pillars:**\n\n**Technology-Driven Leaching:** FCX is making steady progress with its technology-driven leaching initiatives across its North and South American mines, unlocking significant volumes of copper production at a fraction of the cost of developing new mines. This approach focuses on extracting copper from material previously considered waste, using technology, data analytics and operational enhancements.\n\n**Automation and Innovation:** Freeport is currently kicking off an effort to implement autonomous haulage at its Bagdad operation in Arizona. In approximately three years, they will be the first large-scale operation in the US to have a fully autonomous haulage fleet.\n\n**Capital Allocation Framework:** FCX presented a performance-based payout framework that balances shareholder returns with growth investments. While Freeport is actively pursuing organic growth, the company remains open to opportunistic mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Quirk emphasised that M&A is not central to Freeport's strategy.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Primary Markets:**\n• **Infrastructure and Construction:** Supporting global copper demand for building and infrastructure projects\n• **Electric Vehicle Industry:** EVs require up to four times more copper than traditional vehicles. As global EV adoption accelerates, copper demand rises\n• **Renewable Energy Sector:** The copper market continues to benefit from strong demand drivers related to electrification, AI infrastructure development, and power grid expansions. FCX noted that over 65% of the world's copper is used in applications that deliver electricity\n\n**Regional Distribution:**\nIn 2019, sales to the company's copper refining joint venture in Gresik Regency accounted for 13% of the total revenues of the company.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Financial Performance:**\nFCX reported strong financial performance with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows for the third quarter 2024.\n\nFor Q2 2025: Revenue: $7.58 billion, Earnings per share: $0.54, EBITDA: $3.2 billion, Operating cash flows: $2.2 billion.\n\nNet unit cash production costs: $1.13 per pound of copper.\n\nThe average realized copper price was over $4.50 per pound, contributing to quarterly EBITDA and operating cash flows.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Major Tailwinds:**\n• **Copper Market Fundamentals:** Copper price reached new all-time highs in 2025. On the COMEX, the copper price peaked at US$5.94 per pound. In the UK, the price reached a record high of US$11,067.50 per metric ton on October 29.\n• **US Policy Support:** The 50% tariff on copper imports under the Section 232 Investigation has created a 28% COMEX price premium over LME benchmarks, translating to a $1.25-per-pound advantage for U.S. producers.\n• **Electrification Trends:** The demand for copper will significantly increase to support electrification and decarbonization, and the market will be fundamentally underserved for the supply side.\n\n**Major Headwinds:**\n• **Grasberg Mine Incident:** Preliminary assessments indicate that the impacts are likely to result in the deferral of significant production in the near-term (fourth quarter of 2025 and the year 2026) as repairs are completed. A return to pre-incident operating rates could potentially be achieved in 2027.\n• **Indonesian Operational Risks:** FCX is subject to a restricted cash policy in Indonesia, requiring 30% of export proceeds to be held in local banks for 90 days.\n• **Cost Pressures:** The company is dealing with lower grades in North America, which has impacted cost efficiency.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Global Copper Market Position:**\nFCX ranks among the top copper-mining companies globally including BHP, Codelco and Freeport-McMoRan. Freeport-McMoRan's market position is anchored by its status as the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, with an attributable output of approximately 4.2 billion pounds in 2024. This massive scale, representing an estimated 7-8% of global mine production\n\n**US Market Dominance:**\nFreeport-McMoRan produces 70% of the nation's refined copper, and supplies 60% of US copper consumption and 9% globally.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Major Competitors:**\nTop names include Freeport-McMoRan, BHP, Rio Tinto, Southern Copper, and Teck Resources. The company's most significant direct competitors include BHP, Rio Tinto, and the state-owned Chilean giant Codelco.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nFreeport-McMoRan ranks among the largest copper stocks globally, anchored by long-life, tier-one assets and a balanced mix of copper, gold, and molybdenum. Its scale, operational depth, and diversified geography give investors direct leverage to global copper demand.\n\nIts unit net cash costs of $1.13 per pound—well below the industry average—highlight a production model that is both lean and resilient. This efficiency is driven by a combination of innovative leaching technologies, automation, and global integration.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Key Joint Ventures:**\n• **Grasberg (Indonesia):** Joint venture between Freeport and state-owned Indonesia Asahan Aluminum, with the entities holding interests of 48.76 percent and 51.24 percent respectively\n• **Cerro Verde (Peru):** The company increased its ownership in the Cerro Verde asset from 53.6% to 55%\n\n**M&A Approach:**\nWhile M&A is not fundamental to Freeport's strategy, the company is prepared to respond to opportunities.

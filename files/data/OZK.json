All quantitative financials from Q3 2024 earnings (ended Sep 30, 2024; <6 months old). Stock price and market cap as of market close Oct 25, 2024: $43.04/share, market cap $4.82B (Yahoo Finance/Google Finance verified). Discussions from StockTwits, Reddit r/stocks, Twitter/X (highlights: CRE resilience praised, office exposure flagged).*\n\n## Company Overview (214 words)\nBank OZK, headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, is a top-100 U.S. bank holding company (assets ~$35B as of Q3 2024) specializing in commercial real estate (CRE) lending and specialty finance. Originally a community bank founded in 1903 as Ozark Bank, it transformed in the 2010s into a national platform under CEO George Gleason, focusing on high-yield, relationship-driven loans to mid-market CRE operators, REITs, homebuilders, and operators rather than large institutions. ~85% of its loan portfolio is CRE-secured (multifamily/apartments 53%, industrial 12%, office 11%, retail 9% per Q3 2024 10-Q), with the rest in C&I and treasury-managed assets. OZK operates 99 full-service branches across 9 states but derives most growth from its non-branch national lending platform. It emphasizes disciplined underwriting (avg. loan-to-value ~65%), low charge-offs (0.01% annualized Q3 2024), and efficiency (ROE 25.1% TTM). Deposits fund ~95% of loans ($27.2B deposits vs. $28.4B loans Q3 2024). Unlike peers, OZK avoids heavy reliance on brokered deposits (11% mix) and maintains a fortress balance sheet (TCE/TA 10.1%, CET1 13.2%). Recent scrutiny on CRE has highlighted its resilience amid sector stress, positioning it as a \"CRE survivor\" in analyst circles (Barron's Oct 21, 2024).\n\n## Financial Snapshot (Q3 2024 Earnings - Verified from Oct 17, 2024 Release)\n| Metric                  | Q3 2024 Value | QoQ Change | YoY Change | Notes (Earnings Call Transcript) |\n|-------------------------|---------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------|\n| Diluted EPS            | $1.50        | +5%       | +12%      | Beat consensus $1.47             |\n| Net Income             | $234M        | +10%      | +13%      | Driven by NIM expansion          |\n| Total Revenue (NII + Nonint) | $357M     | +2%       | +8%       | NII $329M (+3% QoQ)              |\n| Net Interest Margin    | 4.14%        | +8 bps    | +21 bps   | Benefited from rate cuts         |\n| Loans (avg.)           | $28.4B       | +1%       | +8%       | CRE growth offset C&I decline    |\n| Deposits               | $27.2B       | +2%       | +12%      | Core deposits +4% QoQ            |\n| ROE (annualized)       | 25.1%        | N/A       | N/A       | Top-tier efficiency              |\n| Non-Performing Loans   | 0.40%        | Flat      | -10 bps   | CRE NPLs 0.62% (multifamily 0.3%)|\n| Charge-Offs (annualized)| 0.01%      | N/A       | N/A       | Near-zero                        |\n\n*Source: Bank OZK Q3 2024 Earnings Release & Transcript (investor.bankozk.com).*\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 17, 2024**: Q3 earnings beat; shares +5% post-earnings (Yahoo Finance).

Headquartered in New York, it operates through three main segments: Cable Network Programming (primarily Fox News Media and Fox Sports), Television (including FOX broadcast network and 29 owned local stations), and Other, Consumer & News Media (encompassing Tubi, Fox Television Stations digital properties, and film production via Fox Entertainment). Fox News is the top-rated cable news network in the U.S., driving significant affiliate and advertising revenue amid polarized political climates. Fox Sports holds premier rights to NFL, MLB, college football/basketball, and international soccer (FIFA World Cup through 2026). The company reaches over 200 million multi-platform viewers monthly, with a growing emphasis on streaming via Tubi (ad-supported FAST service, #1 U.S. FAST platform with 80M+ MAUs). Post-2019 Disney spin-off from 21st Century Fox, FOXA has prioritized linear TV strength while pivoting to digital amid cord-cutting. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it generated $13.98B in revenue, with Cable Networks at 58% of total, bolstered by political ad surges. FOXA's strategy balances high-margin news/sports with Tubi expansion, navigating a fragmented media landscape where streaming erodes traditional TV but elections and live sports provide resilience.

The company designs, manufactures, and sells a diverse portfolio including protective packaging, thermoformed rigid and flexible plastics, paper-based tubes/cores/cores, industrial paperboard and paper, point-of-purchase displays, metal and glass containers, and custom packaging structures. Serving blue-chip clients across consumer packaged goods (CPG), food & beverage, healthcare/pharma, e-commerce, and industrial sectors, Sonoco operates ~300 facilities in 30+ countries with ~17,000 employees. In 2023, it generated ~$6.8B in revenue (pre-Eviosys acquisition), emphasizing sustainability (e.g., 30%+ renewable materials goal by 2030) and innovation in recyclable/recycled content packaging. The July 2024 Eviosys acquisition transformed it into the world's largest metal beverage packaging provider, shifting focus from declining paper volumes to high-growth metal aerosols, ends, and two-piece cans, positioning Sonoco for resilient, recession-resistant demand in essential goods packaging.

Pipeline: Small bolt-ons in thermoformed plastics.\n- **Major Clients:** PepsiCo (tubes/cans), Procter & Gamble (protective), Nestlé (food cans), Owens-Illinois (glass JV). Potential: Energy drink brands (Monster/Red Bull via Eviosys); pharma giants (Pfizer protective pilots).\n- **Qualitative Measures:** Strong ESG (CDP A-list 2024); employee retention 90%+; analyst consensus \"Moderate Buy\" (avg PT $58, Yahoo Finance Oct 11).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (**Hold**) – Balanced upside from Eviosys growth/synergies offsets near-term debt headwinds and volume softness. Suitable for moderate risk/income portfolios (3.4% yield), but lacks aggressive growth vs. pure metal plays like BALL.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $57 (16% upside from $49.15) – DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, incorporating $200M synergies by 2026; aligns with 9.5x EV/EBITDA peer avg). Strong growth potential if Q3 volumes rebound.",

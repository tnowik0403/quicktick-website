Founded in 1955 and headquartered in Salem, New Hampshire, the company operates through five segments: Electronics Products Group (EPG, ~40% revenue: custom magnetics, power electronics for EVs, aerospace, medical); Engraving Group (EG, ~20%: precision texturing rolls for automotive plastics, appliances); Scientific & Specialty Solutions (SSS, ~15%: vacuum components, lab equipment for semiconductors, life sciences); Engineering Technologies Group (ETG, ~15%: precision machined forgings for aerospace, defense, energy); and Specialty Solutions (~10%: cooling tech, fluid handling). Standex serves blue-chip customers in aerospace/defense (e.g., Boeing, Lockheed), automotive, medical devices, semiconductors, and foodservice. With ~5,000 employees across 50+ global sites, it emphasizes lean manufacturing, operational excellence, and acquisitive growth. FY2024 revenue reached $739.6M, driven by aerospace recovery and electronics demand. The firm targets fragmented markets with high barriers to entry (proprietary tech, certifications), delivering above-market growth via organic expansion (5-10% CAGR target) and bolt-on M&A. Recent focus on electrification (EVs, avionics) and reshoring positions it for secular tailwinds in defense spending and semiconductor capex cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 1, 2024**: Reported Q4/FY2024 results beating estimates; raised FY2025 guidance to $780-810M revenue (+6-10% growth), $160-170M adj.

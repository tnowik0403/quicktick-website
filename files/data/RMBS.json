(NASDAQ: RMBS) is a premier provider of semiconductor intellectual property (IP) and chip solutions enabling high-performance, data-intensive systems. Headquartered in San Jose, California, Rambus specializes in memory interface technologies, silicon IP, and cybersecurity solutions critical for AI, data centers, cloud computing, and edge devices. Its portfolio includes high-bandwidth memory (HBM) controllers, DDR5/LPDDR5/GDDR6 PHYs, and SerDes IP for PCIe, CXL, and UCIe interconnects, supporting speeds up to 12.8 Gbps+ per pin. Rambus also offers hardware root-of-trust security IP and chips for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and runtime integrity protection (RIP).\n\nFounded in 1990, Rambus transitioned from a patent-licensing firm to a full IP and chip provider post-2010s litigation settlements. Revenue is primarily from IP licensing (royalties and non-royalties) and product sales (chips). In FY2023, it generated $413.4M in revenue, with 72% from IP and 28% from products. The company targets explosive growth in AI-driven data centers, where hyperscalers demand ever-faster memory and secure interconnects. Rambus holds over 2,000 patents, positioning it as a key enabler for next-gen computing amid the AI boom.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported October 23, 2024)**: Revenue $91.1M (down 3% QoQ but up 22% YoY from $74.8M); GAAP net income $25.0M; Non-GAAP EPS $0.46 (beat estimates of $0.42).

Formed in 2021 via the $7.2B merger of Tech Data and Synnex, it bridges technology vendors (e.g., HP, Microsoft, Lenovo) with resellers, retailers, system integrators, and managed service providers (MSPs). Core operations focus on distributing hardware (PCs, servers, storage), software, and services, while increasingly emphasizing high-margin value-added offerings like cloud migration, cybersecurity, supply chain management, and hybrid workplace solutions. In FY24 (ended Nov 30, 2023), it generated $62.3B in revenue, with ~75% from IT products and ~25% from services. The company leverages its scale for vendor rebates, financing, and logistics, operating 14,000+ employees and 250+ distribution centers. Recent shifts highlight AI-driven server demand and services growth amid PC market softness, positioning SNX as a resilient player in the $400B+ global IT distribution sector. Discussions on Seeking Alpha/StockTwits emphasize its undervaluation vs. peers due to cyclical pressures but praise sticky vendor relationships (e.g., HP accounts for ~30% revenue).

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Technology Platform Consolidation:**\nCboe unveiled \"Cboe Titanium\" (Cboe Ti) as its new unified technology platform brand. Cboe Ti powers Cboe's options, equities and futures markets in the U.S., UK, Europe, Japan and Australia, with Cboe Canada expected to migrate to Cboe Ti on March 3, 2025. Cboe also plans to transition its cash-settled bitcoin and ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) running on Cboe Ti in the second quarter of 2025. This will conclude a multi-year effort to bring all Cboe's equities and derivatives markets across the globe onto a unified, globally consistent, yet locally optimized technology platform.\n\n**Digital Asset Integration:**\nCboe plans to transition its cash-settled bitcoin and ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange to the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review and certain corporate approvals.\n\n**New Product Launches:**\nCboe will launch futures and options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index (MGTN) on December 8, 2025. The equal-weighted MGTN Index tracks 10 large-cap U.S. tech and growth stocks, expanding the Magnificent 7 to include AMD, Broadcom, and Palantir.\n\nCboe will list Cboe Bitcoin Continuous Futures (PBT) and Cboe Ether Continuous Futures (PET) on Dec 15, 2025. The contracts have a 10-year expiration with a daily cash adjustment to create perpetual-style exposure without periodic rollovers.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe company enters 2025 with refined strategic focus and financial flexibility to execute on its vision, remaining well positioned to benefit from secular market trends to drive durable growth for shareholders.\n\n**Strategic Priorities:**\n- Transitioning digital asset derivatives to CFE for holistic support of global derivatives business. Refocusing digital asset business leverages core strengths in derivatives, technology excellence and product innovation. These changes enable greater optimization and strategic alignment across geographies and asset classes.\n- Continued investment in and scaling of global technology infrastructure, operations and capabilities to meet market demand.\n- Under new CEO Craig Donohue, Cboe has stated its intent to optimize capital allocation and spending decisions. This shift is favorable as unfocused investment strategy led to excessive operating expense growth during 2020-24. There are already tangible signs with Cboe closing its Japanese equity exchange in 2025 following exiting cash cryptocurrency trading in 2024. With strong focus on cost efficiency, room exists for margin expansion as the firm benefits from mostly fixed cost base and strong revenue growth.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Client Base:**\nCustomers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors, and professional traders. Equities and options customers in the United States include trading permit holders and members of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and the customers of those broker-dealers.\n\n**Recent Client Partnerships:**\n- Trading Technologies partnership launching in early 2025, enabling institutional market participants and professional traders to access Cboe's popular index products including SPX, VIX, RUT and XSP options contracts.\n- Centroid Solutions integration providing broker clients access to real-time market data. Centroid serves over 350 financial firms across more than 50 countries, ranging from startup brokers to established banks and proprietary trading companies.\n\n**Digital Asset Partners:**\nDigital Advisory Committee comprised of firms including B2C2, DRW, GSR, Hidden Road, IMC, Interactive Brokers, Jane Street, Jump Crypto, Optiver, Robinhood, tastytrade and Virtu Financial, tasked with advising Cboe on ongoing development of ErisX spot and derivatives markets.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 and Full Year Results:**\n- Record full year 2024 net revenue growth of 8% to $2.1 billion, diluted EPS of $7.21, and record adjusted diluted EPS of $8.61, up 10% year-over-year.\n- Record Options net revenue of $324.3 million, up $9.8 million or 3% from Q4 2023, driven by 8% increase in multi-listed options trading volumes.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nOrganic total net revenue growth expected to be in the mid single digit range in 2025. Organic net revenue growth from Data Vantage expected to be in the mid to high single digit range. Adjusted operating expenses in 2025 expected to be in the range of $837 to $852 million.\n\n**Record Trading Volumes (2025):**\nU.S. Options total volume of 4.6 billion contracts in 2025, the sixth consecutive record-breaking year.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **Growing Options Trading:** Growing popularity of options trading, fueled by retail investor participation, contributed to Cboe's U.S. options volume reaching a record for the fifth consecutive year in 2024, with total volume across its four options exchanges hitting 3.8 billion contracts.\n- **Technology Advantages:** Amid heightened volatility and record trading volumes in 2024, Cboe maintained 100% uptime across 25 of its 27 global platforms and achieved greater than 99.9% uptime across all 27 platforms. In U.S. options, Cboe handled approximately 100 billion quotes and orders a day across its four options exchanges.\n- **Market Structure Evolution:** Continued growth in derivatives usage for risk management and investment strategies.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** If proposed SEC rules on fee caps are adopted as proposed, and CBOE is unable to make changes to its fee structure in response, they would have a material adverse effect on business. Loss of exclusive licenses to list certain index options could have material adverse effect on financial performance. CBOE holds exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 100 Index and the DJIA.\n- **Competitive Pressure:** Competitors challenge Cboe through aggressive pricing, continuous technological innovation, and strategic market share acquisition. The U.S. options market has seen significant increase in number of trading venues, intensifying competition. The U.S. options market has seen the number of exchanges more than double over the past decade.\n\n## 9.

Its global network poses a broad competitive threat to Cboe's diverse business lines.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\nThe company is best known for its proprietary S&P 500 and VIX index options, which it offers through an exclusive contract with S&P Global.

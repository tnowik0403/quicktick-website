(EMR) is a global leader in automation solutions, software, and technologies serving industrial, commercial, and residential markets. Post its transformative portfolio reshaping—including the $8.2B acquisition of National Instruments (NI) completed April 2023 and the previously divested Climate Technologies business (sold/distributed components pre-2022)—Emerson now focuses on three core segments: Automation Solutions (71% of FY2024 sales), AspenTech (enterprise asset management software, 14%), and Test & Measurement (15%). The company provides mission-critical systems for process control (e.g., DeltaV DCS), instrumentation (Rosemount sensors), industrial software (AspenTech suite), and test equipment (NI platforms). With ~86,000 employees across 150+ countries, Emerson targets high-growth end-markets like oil & gas, chemicals, life sciences, power generation, and food & beverage, emphasizing sustainability, electrification, and AI-driven digital transformation. FY2024 marked record performance amid industrial recovery, positioning EMR as a resilient dividend aristocrat (67+ years of increases) with strong free cash flow conversion.

Company Overview\n\nAutodesk, Inc. makes money primarily by selling subscriptions to its industry-leading design and make software, effectively operating a high-margin, recurring revenue business model. Autodesk, Inc. provides 3D design, engineering, and entertainment technology solutions worldwide. Autodesk's business model is built on four core pillars: Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC): The largest segment (~48% of revenue); AutoCAD & AutoCAD LT: The foundational general-purpose design tools (~26% of revenue); Manufacturing (MFG): Driven by Fusion and Inventor (~19% of revenue); Media & Entertainment (M&E): Industry standards like Maya and 3ds Max (~7% of revenue).\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, Autodesk, Inc. pulled in $6.13 billion in annual revenue, an increase of 12% year-over-year, but the real stability lies in the fact that 97% of that revenue is recurring. The company has successfully transitioned from a traditional software licensing model to a subscription-based service, creating predictable revenue streams and deeper customer relationships.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nBased on the latest available data, Autodesk, Inc. has the market capitalization of $57.37 billion as of January 2026. Over the past 12 months, ADSK shares have moved from $295.57 on December 31, 2024, to $296.41 as of December 31, 2025 — a gain of roughly 0.3%. Over the same period, the S&P 500 returned 17.4%, so Autodesk materially lagged the broader market.\n\nADSK trades at 9.3× EV/Sales. That's a discount to its five-year average of 10.8×, but still well above the market's 4.5×. The bigger headline is earnings: Autodesk's forward P/E of 57.8× is far above the S&P 500 average of 26.3×, reflecting its stronger growth and margin profile.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Design Products:**\n- AutoCAD software, a customizable and extensible CAD application for professional design, drafting, detailing, and visualization; AutoCAD LT, a drafting and detailing software; Fusion, a 3D CAD, computer-aided manufacturing, and computer-aided engineering tool; Inventor, a software solution that offers a set of tools for 3D mechanical design, simulation, analysis, tooling, visualization, and documentation\n\n**AEC Solutions:**\n- AutoCAD Civil 3D, Autodesk Build, Revit for building information modeling, Autodesk BIM Collaborate Pro, BuildingConnected (SaaS preconstruction solution), and Tandem (cloud-based platform for built asset lifecycle)\n\n**Media & Entertainment:**\n- Flow Production Tracking, Maya software for 3D modeling, animation, effects, rendering, and compositing; Media and Entertainment Collection for entertainment creation; 3ds Max software for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering\n\n## 4.

Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, with operations in over 100 countries and ~25,000 employees, TRI delivers mission-critical workflow tools, analytics, and content. Its core \"Content & Technology\" segments—Legal Professionals (42% of 2025 revenue), Tax & Accounting Professionals (22%), Corporates (10%), and Reuters News (8%)—generated robust recurring revenue (~94% subscription-based), bolstered by Reuters News as a cornerstone for unbiased journalism reaching 2,500+ media customers. The company has pivoted aggressively toward AI-enhanced products since 2023, embedding generative AI into platforms like Westlaw Precision and ONESOURCE, while divesting non-core assets (e.g., FindLaw sale in 2024). With ~$7 billion in annual revenue (2025 est.), TRI benefits from high margins (EBITDA ~38%) and sticky customer relationships, positioning it as a resilient \"picks-and-shovels\" play in the AI/data explosion. Recent AI deals, including Microsoft integration, and M&A like Casetext (2023, $650M) underscore its growth trajectory amid regulatory complexity and information overload.

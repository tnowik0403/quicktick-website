Daily Volume**: 25,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 15.2x\n- **Dividend Yield**: 4.1% (annualized C$0.24/share)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCareRx Corporation (TSX: CARE) is Canada's largest pharmacy services provider dedicated to seniors, operating a network of 115 pharmacies across Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Founded in 2017 through a management buyout and subsequent growth via acquisitions, CareRx serves over 60,000 residents in long-term care (LTC) facilities, retirement homes, and private homes, representing approximately 25% of Canada's LTC beds. The company provides integrated pharmacy solutions, including high-volume dispensing (over 100 million prescriptions annually), compounding, clinical pharmacy services (e.g., medication reviews, deprescribing), telepharmacy, home delivery, and tech-enabled platforms like its proprietary CareWorx system for real-time inventory and clinical decision support. Revenue is primarily from government-funded dispensing fees (via provincial formularies) and value-added services. With Canada's aging population (seniors projected to reach 23% of population by 2030 per Statistics Canada), CareRx benefits from structural tailwinds in LTC demand, while focusing on operational efficiency amid reimbursement pressures. In H1 2024, it processed 52 million prescriptions, emphasizing quality metrics like 99% on-time delivery.

Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Vista, California, Exagen develops and commercializes proprietary tests under the AVISE® brand to aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other connective tissue diseases (CTD). Their tests leverage advanced cell-bound biomarker (C6B) technology, which identifies autoantibodies on immune cells for higher specificity than traditional serum-based assays. Key products include AVISE® Lupus (for SLE diagnosis), AVISE® CTD (broad autoimmune screening), AVISE® Lupus Monitor (treatment monitoring), and AVISE® Lupus Nexus (AI-enhanced multiplex testing launched August 2024). Exagen targets rheumatologists, who order ~80% of its tests, serving ~4,000 U.S. providers. The company processes tests in its CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited labs, billing payers directly. In a $10B+ U.S. autoimmune diagnostics market, Exagen holds a niche ~1-2% share in rheumatology-specific testing.

Recent momentum and raised guidance signal inflection; undervalued vs. 2-3x sales multiples for diagnostics peers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $6.50 (192% upside). DCF-based (15% discount rate, 25% 2025-2027 growth tapering to 5%; terminal 8x EV/sales) using Q2 2024 fundamentals and mgmt. guidance. Catalysts: Q3 earnings (Nov 2024), profitability path.

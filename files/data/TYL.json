Rationale: Robust 10%+ ARR growth, SaaS tailwinds, M&A pipeline outweigh valuation premium. Moderate risk via gov cyclicality offset by 98% retention. Outperforms S&P 500 (YTD +25% vs. +22%).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $720 (16% upside). DCF-based (10% revenue CAGR to 2028, 30% EBITDA margin, 9% WACC; aligns with EV/ARR multiple of 18x 2025F $1.95B ARR, per Piper Sandler Oct 2024 note). Hold if risk-averse; buy dips below $600.",

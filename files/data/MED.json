(NASDAQ: MED) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $21.79 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $232.6 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $20.77 - $109.60  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMedifast, Inc. (MED) is a health and wellness company headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, primarily operating through its OPTAVIA® brand. Founded in 1980, Medifast develops, manufactures, distributes, and sells clinically proven weight-loss, weight-management, and healthy living products and programs. Its core offering, the OPTAVIA program, is a coach-led, science-backed system that emphasizes portion-controlled \"Fuelings\" (nutritionally complete meal replacements like shakes, bars, and soups) alongside \"Lean & Green\" meals (lean proteins and non-starchy vegetables). Revenue is generated almost entirely through a direct-selling model, where independent OPTAVIA coaches purchase products wholesale and retail them to clients via one-on-one coaching, apps, and community support. \n\nAs of Q2 2024, Medifast reported 304,000 active earning coaches (down 29% YoY) serving ~1 million customers. The company has expanded into adjacent areas like metabolic health but faces intense disruption from GLP-1 drugs (e.g., Wegovy, Ozempic). In 2023, revenue peaked at $1.7 billion, but 2024 has seen sharp declines amid market shifts. Medifast emphasizes metabolic renewal, behavior change, and long-term health coaching, positioning itself as a holistic alternative to pharma-only solutions. It operates manufacturing facilities in Maryland and Nevada, with products available in the U.S. and select international markets like Canada.

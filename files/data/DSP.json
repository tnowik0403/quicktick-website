(DSP) is a leading people-based advertising technology company that powers programmatic digital advertising through its AI-driven demand-side platform (DSP), Adelphic. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Irvine, California, Viant enables advertisers to plan, buy, optimize, and measure omnichannel campaigns across connected TV (CTV), desktop, mobile, and digital out-of-home (DOOH) channels. The company's proprietary Household ID technology provides privacy-compliant, cookie-independent targeting using first-party and matched second-party data from its T1 Data Marketplace, aggregating anonymized signals from 200+ million households (covering ~90% of US households). \n\nViant's platform leverages AI for audience discovery, creative optimization, and performance attribution, serving over 1,000 advertisers including Fortune 500 brands. In 2023, it processed $2.4B in media spend across 120+ categories. The company went public via SPAC merger in 2021 and focuses on high-growth areas like CTV (48% YoY growth in Q2 2024) and retail media networks (RMNs). With a scalable SaaS model, Viant reported Q2 2024 revenue of $61.8M (up 27% YoY), achieving profitability with net income of $10.7M and Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6M. Its take rate improved to 19.1%, driven by self-serve adoption and AI efficiencies. Viant differentiates in a post-cookie world by emphasizing deterministic data and AI automation, positioning it for the shift to privacy-first advertising amid regulatory changes like GDPR and CCPA.

Potential tuck-in for data/RMN.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Top tiers include Verizon, Coca-Cola, Disney, JPMorgan, Pfizer (~40% revenue from top 10).\n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding to pharma (e.g., Pfizer pilots), CPG giants via RMN, agencies like IPG/Omnicom.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Tim Mahoney (ex-Weather Channel) strong track record; insider ownership ~15%.\n- **ESG**: High privacy compliance scores; carbon-neutral data centers.\n- **Risks**: Volatility (beta 1.8); litigation exposure in adtech.\n- **Moat**: Household ID moat in cookie-less era; AI IP portfolio (50+ patents).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (Strong Buy – Hold for growth upside). Rationale: 20%+ growth at 1.2x P/S undervalues CTV/AI momentum vs. peers (TTD 18x); Q3 beat likely; moderate risk from ad cyclicality offset by profitability/cash hoard.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $20.00/share (68% upside). Based on 2.5x 2025E EV/Revenue ($320M rev at 25% growth, 20% margin), discounted for size risk. DCF implies $22 (10% WACC, 25% CAGR 3Y). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 30%+ IRR. \n\n*Sources: Company filings (Q2 2024 10-Q, earnings call transcript Aug 7), Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (Oct 18 data), Seeking Alpha/Benzinga articles (Oct 2024), eMarketer/IAB reports.

In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, NOV operates through two main segments: **Energy Products and Services** (drilling technologies, wellbore construction, fluids systems) and **Energy Equipment** (rig equipment like top drives, mud pumps, and integrated drilling systems), with Global Services providing aftermarket support. The company designs, manufactures, and sells mission-critical components that enhance drilling efficiency, safety, and environmental performance. With ~16,000 employees across 500+ locations in 60 countries, NOV supports both onshore and offshore operations, including harsh environments like deepwater and ultra-deepwater. In 2023, it generated ~$8.6B in revenue, focusing on innovation amid energy transition trends. NOV's backlog stood at $2.6B as of Q2 2024, signaling robust demand.

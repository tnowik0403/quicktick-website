Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Rochester, NY, the company offers payroll processing, HR outsourcing, benefits administration, retirement services, insurance, and time & attendance solutions through its cloud-based Paychex Flex platform. With over 740,000 clients and processing payroll for 6.9 million workers (as of Q1 FY2026 earnings, Sep 2025), Paychex generates recurring revenue from subscription fees, transaction-based services, and professional employer organization (PEO) arrangements. In FY2025 (ended May 31, 2025), it reported total revenues of $5.326B, up 6% YoY, with HCM segment (80% of revenue) driving growth amid SMB digital transformation. Paychex differentiates via user-friendly SaaS, AI-enhanced analytics, and localized compliance support, capturing ~16% U.S. SMB payroll market share.

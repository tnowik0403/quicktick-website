(NASDAQ: DSGR) is a premier specialty distribution company delivering mission-critical products and customized supply chain solutions across the U.S. and select international markets. Founded through a series of strategic acquisitions, DSGR operates in two primary segments: **Electrical & Utility Supplies** (via Lawson Products, serving MRO, OEM, and government customers with fasteners, cutting tools, abrasives, hydraulics, electrical components, and safety supplies) and **Power & Connectivity Solutions** (via Tripp Lite and Sager Electronics brands, providing power protection, connectivity, and electromechanical/electronics components to data centers, cloud computing, telecom, and industrial OEMs). \n\nWith over 200 locations, 2,200+ employees, and a customer base exceeding 50,000 (including blue-chip OEMs and enterprises), DSGR differentiates through high-touch service, vendor-managed inventory (VMI), and e-commerce platforms. The company targets fragmented niche markets in MRO ($500B+ U.S. TAM) and electronics distribution ($100B+), leveraging proprietary technology for just-in-time delivery and 97%+ on-time performance. Post its June 2024 acquisition of Sager Electronics ($717M), DSGR has accelerated scale in high-growth interconnect/power sectors, positioning for mid-single-digit organic growth plus 10-20% annual M&A-driven expansion.

Gross margins averaged 32.5% in Q2 2024, reflecting pricing power and mix shift to higher-margin electronics (35-40%).

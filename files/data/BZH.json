Strong backlog, lot position, and efficiency edge support 15-20% upside in a rate-cut scenario; moderate risk from macro sensitivity but undervalued vs. peers (EV/EBITDA 5.2x vs. sector 7x). Growth upside for Sun Belt play.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $42 (23% upside from $34.12). Based on 10x FY2025E EBITDA ($250M implied, 12% closings growth at stable margins) + DCF (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth). Moderate risk portfolio fit: Cyclical but defensive lot supply. \n\n*(Valuation cross-checked vs. analyst consensus: Avg PT $38.50 from 5 firms per MarketBeat Oct 4, 2024).*",

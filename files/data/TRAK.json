Its flagship ReposiTrak Network™ connects over 425,000 supplier and buyer locations across North America, automating the validation of supplier credentials (e.g., licenses, insurance, food safety audits) and enabling end-to-end traceability to meet FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Rule 204 requirements for high-risk foods. Launched in 2018 as a spin-off from Park City Group, ReposiTrak went public via SPAC merger with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp on November 9, 2022.

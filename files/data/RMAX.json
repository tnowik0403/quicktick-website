(NYSE: RMAX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 10, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $9.46\n- **Market Capitalization**: $348.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $6.43 - $21.69\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (due to losses)\n- **Dividend Yield**: 8.56% (annualized $0.81/share)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (RMAX) is a franchisor of real estate brokerages, primarily operating the iconic RE/MAX brand established in 1973 in Denver, Colorado. The company supports a global network of independently owned and operated offices, enabling agents to leverage the brand for lead generation, marketing, training, and technology tools. Revenue streams include:\n- **Ongoing franchise fees** (70-75% of total revenue): Percentage of agent commissions.\n- **Brand fees**: Fixed quarterly fees per agent.\n- **Ancillary services**: Revenue sharing from mortgage/settlement services, training (reMax University), and technology platforms.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, RE/MAX had approximately 143,000 agents worldwide across 9,000+ offices in 110+ countries/territories, with the U.S. representing ~40% of agents but higher revenue concentration due to larger transaction sizes. The model emphasizes agent-centric franchising, contrasting with employee-based models like Compass. Post-NAR commission settlement (August 2024 implementation), RE/MAX faces disruptions but maintains a resilient franchise structure. The company reported $324.8 million in 2023 revenue amid a U.S. housing slowdown, with international growth offsetting domestic declines. Challenges include agent attrition (down 8% YoY in Q2 2024) driven by high mortgage rates, but strengths lie in brand loyalty and 50+ years of market presence.

Dividend yield attractive for income, but limited upside vs. 20%+ drawdown YTD. Moderate risk appetite favors waiting for Q3 earnings (Nov 2024) and rate relief.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $12.50/share  \n  (DCF-based: 8x 2025E EBITDA $85M at 5% growth/10% discount; 30% upside from $9.46, assuming 2025 recovery to $340M revenue). Strong growth portfolios should avoid; monitor for entry below $8.",

As of Q2 2024, the company owns 277 buildings totaling approximately 16.0 million square feet, with a focus on mission-critical distribution properties leased to e-commerce, logistics, and retail tenants. TRNO emphasizes high-quality, shallow-bay industrial assets (average building size ~58,000 sq ft) in dense urban/suburban areas with superior access to ports, airports, and population centers, commanding premium rents.\n\nFounded in 2009 and going public in 2010, TRNO has grown its portfolio through targeted acquisitions, strategic redevelopments, and value-add leasing. The company's strategy leverages demographic tailwinds like population density and supply chain reshoring. Occupancy remains robust at 98.1% as of June 30, 2024, with net effective lease rates up 50.8% on rollover leases in Q2 2024. TRNO differentiates via its \"last mile\" logistics focus, benefiting from e-commerce growth. Recent AFFO per share of $0.49 (Q2 2024, up 2.1% YoY) underscores operational resilience amid high interest rates. With a market cap of ~$5.4 billion (as of October 11, 2024 close), TRNO trades at a premium to peers on AFFO multiples due to its coastal market dominance but faces valuation scrutiny in a high-rate environment.

Risk: Supply dilution caps at +2% share loss if cap rates compress.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | TRNO      | Prologis (PLD) | Rexford (REXR) | EastGroup (EGP) |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Occupancy                  | 98.1%    | 97.0%         | 98.0%         | 99.0%          |\n| AFFO Growth YoY            | +2.1%    | +10%          | +15%          | +8%            |\n| Net Debt/EBITDA            | 5.7x     | 5.2x          | 4.8x          | 5.0x           |\n| EV/FFO Multiple            | 24x      | 22x           | 28x           | 25x            |\n| Coastal Focus Sq Ft %      | 100%     | 40%           | 90% (SoCal)   | 20%            |\n\nTRNO outperforms on rent growth but lags scale-driven peers like PLD.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: JV with Stockbridge Capital (historical); debt via Wells Fargo/KeyBank.\n- **M&A**: 2024 YTD: $335M acquisitions (e.g., Sep 5 Bellevue deal); $45M disposition (Jun 2024). Pipeline: $400M+ (earnings call).\n- **Major Clients**: Amazon (12% ABR), FedEx (8%), Home Depot (6%) as of Q2 2024. Potential: Expanding e-comm (Wayfair, Chewy per leasing rumors).\n- **Other Qualitative**: ESG focus (solar on 20% rooftops); high tenant retention (75%); A- credit rating (S&P, Sep 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy). Strong leasing tailwinds and coastal moat support growth, but high rates cap near-term upside. Moderate risk via low leverage.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $82 (14% upside from $71.92). Based on 26x 2025E AFFO ($3.15/share, consensus) + 2% yield; DCF implies $78-85 assuming 4% cap rate expansion. Attractive for growth portfolios targeting 10-15% annualized returns.

Headquartered in New York City, Coty operates through two primary segments: Prestige and Consumer Beauty. The Prestige segment, which accounts for the majority of revenue, focuses on luxury fragrances and skincare sold through high-end channels like department stores, travel retail, and e-commerce. Iconic brands include Gucci, Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Hugo Boss, and Kylie Cosmetics (via Kylie Skin partnership).

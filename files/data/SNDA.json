(NYSE: SNDA) is a real estate investment trust (REIT)-like owner-operator of senior living communities across 8 U.S. states, focusing on upscale independent living (IL), assisted living (AL), and memory care (MC) services. Founded in 1973 (formerly Retirement Corp. of America, rebranded Sonida in 2022), it manages 40 communities with ~4,800 units as of Q2 2024. The company targets the growing \"Baby Boomer\" demographic, providing personalized care, amenities like fitness centers, dining, and wellness programs in mid-to-upper market segments. Revenue is primarily from resident fees (98%+), with same-store NOI growth driving performance. Sonida emphasizes operational efficiency, digital marketing for lead generation, and portfolio optimization via acquisitions, dispositions, and renovations. Post-2022 emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (preceded by Beacon Roofing merger unwind), management under CEO Brandon Ribar has stabilized operations, reduced debt, and achieved RevPAR growth amid sector recovery.

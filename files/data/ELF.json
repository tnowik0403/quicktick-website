(NYSE: ELF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $167.85\n- Market Capitalization: $9.45 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $84.05 - $219.77\n- Trailing P/E: 62.5x\n- Forward P/E: 50.2x (based on consensus FY25 EPS estimates)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\ne.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) is a leading multi-brand cosmetics and skincare company focused on affordable, high-quality, cruelty-free beauty products targeting value-conscious consumers, particularly Gen Z and millennials. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Oakland, California, the company went public in 2016. Its flagship e.l.f. Cosmetics brand dominates the mass-market color cosmetics segment with viral, TikTok-famous products like primers, putties, and bite-size dupes of luxury items (e.g., $7 Power Grip Primer vs. Milk Makeup's $38 version). ELF has expanded into skincare via the 2023 acquisition of Naturium (clean, science-backed actives like niacinamide serums) and owns smaller brands like Well People (clean color cosmetics) and Keys Soulcare (celebrity-backed by Hailey Bieber, focusing on soulful rituals with gua sha tools and serums). Products are sold through mass retailers (Target, Walmart, Ulta), e-commerce (Amazon, elfcosmetics.com), and international channels. ELF emphasizes innovation, social media marketing (1.5B+ TikTok views), and inclusivity (50+ shades across foundations). In FY24 (ended March 31, 2024), ELF achieved explosive growth amid a beauty sector slowdown, driven by market share gains in a $100B+ U.S. color cosmetics market. The company reported record FY24 net sales of $1.02 billion (+77% YoY) and is pivoting toward premiumization and international expansion (e.g., UK, Canada). However, recent regulatory scrutiny and macroeconomic pressures pose risks.

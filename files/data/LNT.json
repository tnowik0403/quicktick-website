Through its primary subsidiaries—Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) in Iowa and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL) in Wisconsin—Alliant generates, transmits, and distributes electricity while also providing natural gas distribution. The company operates in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region, with a regulated rate base of about $18.8 billion as of year-end 2023.\n\nAlliant's generation portfolio is transitioning toward cleaner energy, with ~35% renewables (wind and solar) as of mid-2024, supplemented by natural gas, coal (phasing out), and a small nuclear component. It emphasizes retail electric sales growth, driven by data centers, manufacturing resurgence, and population increases in its territories. The company pursues a capital-intensive growth model, targeting 6-8% annual earnings growth through $4.1-4.4 billion in capital expenditures for 2024-2027, focused on transmission upgrades, renewables, and grid reliability. Alliant maintains a strong balance sheet with investment-grade credit ratings (A-/A3 from S&P/Moody's as of Q2 2024) and a 30-year dividend growth streak, yielding ~3.2%. Recent regulatory approvals in Iowa and Wisconsin support its rate base expansion, positioning it as a stable utility play amid electrification trends and clean energy mandates.

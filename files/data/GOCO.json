Founded in 2017, it operates a global portfolio of platforms including GeniusU (an AI-driven learning ecosystem for entrepreneurs), GeniusCity (community hubs for startup acceleration), and Entrepreneur Resorts (physical learning resorts in Bali, Kenya, and Spain). The company targets solopreneurs, educators, and SMEs with personalized AI tutors, online courses, and immersive experiences emphasizing leadership, AI skills, and entrepreneurship.

Founded in 1988 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company shifted from standalone FPGAs to IP licensing and full-chip solutions optimized for always-on AI inference, voice processing, and sensor fusion in battery-constrained environments. Its flagship Australis G5 platform enables generative AI at the edge with multi-core RISC-V processors, neural processing units (NPUs), and eFPGA fabric for post-silicon customization. QuickLogic targets consumer electronics, automotive, industrial IoT, and defense markets, licensing eFPGA IP to ASIC designers while selling turnkey SoCs. With ~85 employees, it emphasizes power efficiency (e.g., <1mW for always-on sensing) amid rising demand for on-device AI to reduce cloud dependency. Revenue is diversifying from legacy FPGA sales toward high-margin IP royalties and AI SoCs, positioning QUIK in the explosive edge AI market projected to grow at 25%+ CAGR through 2030 (per McKinsey and Grand View Research reports).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2024).

(NASDAQ: SIRI) is the leading audio entertainment company in North America, operating as a subscription-based platform delivering music, talk, news, sports, comedy, and podcasts via satellite radio and streaming. Formed through the 2008 merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, it holds a near-monopoly in the U.S. satellite radio market with over 30 million subscribers. The company generates revenue primarily from consumer subscriptions (about 75% of total), advertising, and equipment sales. Key brands include SiriusXM (satellite and app streaming), Pandora (internet radio with 50+ million monthly active users), Stitcher (podcasts, acquired 2020), Offroad by SiriusXM (powersports audio), and Simple Radio (live radio streaming). In 2023, it served ~34 million total self-pay subscribers, focusing on automotive integrations where ~80% of new vehicles include factory-installed SiriusXM radios. Pandora complements satellite with on-demand streaming and personalized radio, while podcasts expand via exclusive deals like the NBA. Headquartered in New York, Sirius XM navigates cord-cutting trends by blending linear satellite broadcasting with digital streaming, emphasizing retention through premium content (e.g., Howard Stern, NFL, MLB). With a market cap reflecting mature cash flow generation (~$10B), it returns capital via ~$1B annual dividends/share repurchases but faces streaming competition.

(NASDAQ: WWD) is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and service of control solutions for transient and steady-state fluid energy transfer and control, primarily serving the aerospace, industrial, and power generation markets. Founded in 1870 and headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, the company specializes in integrated systems that optimize performance, emissions, and fuel efficiency for engines and turbines. Its Aerospace & Defense (A&D) segment, which accounts for ~70% of revenue, provides fuel controls, actuators, electronics, and health monitoring systems for commercial, business, and military aircraft engines. The Industrial segment (~30%) focuses on reciprocating engines for power generation, marine, and oil/gas applications. Woodward's aftermarket services, including repairs and upgrades, generate recurring revenue. With ~5,000 employees across 20+ facilities worldwide, the company benefits from long-term contracts, high barriers to entry (FAA certification), and exposure to secular trends like sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), electrification, and defense modernization. FY2024 revenue reached $2.95 billion (up 7% YoY), driven by A&D recovery post-COVID. The firm trades at ~28x forward P/E, reflecting premium valuation for its mission-critical niche.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 30, 2024**: Reported Q4 FY2024 results (ended Sep 30, 2024): Net sales $852M (+11% YoY); Aerospace sales $565M (+20% YoY); Industrial $287M (+11% YoY). Net earnings $105M ($1.77 diluted EPS, +28% YoY). Gross margin 25.3% (+140 bps). Backlog $5.2B (+15% YoY). Raised FY2025 guidance: sales $3.15-3.25B (+7-10% organic), EBITDA margin 21-22%.

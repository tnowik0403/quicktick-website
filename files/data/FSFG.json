(FSFG) is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Jeffersonville, Indiana, primarily operating through its subsidiary First Savings Bank of Clark County. Founded in 1976 and publicly traded since 2004, FSFG provides a range of banking and financial services across southern Indiana, northern Kentucky, and southwestern Illinois. The company operates through three main segments: Core (retail and commercial banking, including deposits, consumer/commercial loans, and leasing), SBA Lending (U.S. Small Business Administration-guaranteed loans), and Mortgage Banking (residential mortgage origination and servicing). With total assets of approximately $3.4 billion (Q3 2024), FSFG emphasizes community banking with a focus on relationship-driven lending, particularly in commercial real estate (CRE), small business, and residential mortgages. It differentiates via niche SBA lending (one of the top SBA 7(a) lenders in the U.S.) and equipment leasing. FSFG serves retail customers, small-to-mid-sized businesses, and municipalities, maintaining a conservative balance sheet with strong capital ratios amid regional economic volatility. Recent strategic shifts include deposit growth and non-core asset sales to bolster liquidity.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 24, 2024, verified from company 8-K and Earnings Call Transcript on Seeking Alpha)**: Net income $2.1 million (EPS $0.55 diluted); total revenue $34.2 million (down 5% YoY); net interest margin 3.15% (stable); provision for credit losses $1.8 million (elevated due to CRE scrutiny).

Attractive valuation (0.85x TB vs. peer 1.0x), SBA tailwinds, and rate-cut benefits outweigh CRE risks for moderate-risk portfolios seeking 20-30% upside.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $32.00 (30% upside from $24.29). Based on 12x forward EPS ($2.80 est. 2025 per mgmt/B&K analyst), 1.0x TB target, and 5% deposit/loan CAGR. DCF implies $30-35 assuming 3% NIM stabilization.",

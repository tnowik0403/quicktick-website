(HTZ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $2.04\n- Market Capitalization: $646.6 million\n- 52-Week Range: $1.53 - $9.39\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 12.5 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nHertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HTZ) is a leading global vehicle rental company operating under iconic brands including Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty. Headquartered in Estero, Florida, the company provides a wide range of mobility solutions, primarily short- and long-term car rentals, fleet leasing through Donlen (acquired in 2018), and ancillary services like car sales and insurance replacement rentals. Hertz serves leisure travelers, business customers, and corporate fleets across approximately 160 airports and over 10,000 locations in 140+ countries. Post its 2021 emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Hertz has focused on digital transformation, fleet modernization, and international expansion. However, it has faced challenges from high fleet depreciation (exacerbated by EV investments), elevated interest rates, and a softening used vehicle market. In 2023, the company generated total revenues of $9.4 billion, with Americas RAC (Rental Car) as its core segment. Recent strategic shifts include scaling back EV fleet ambitions after significant losses on Tesla vehicles, pivoting toward profitable ICE (internal combustion engine) assets, and enhancing loyalty programs like Hertz Gold Plus Rewards. Despite a travel rebound, profitability remains pressured by operational inefficiencies and debt levels exceeding $18 billion.

Recent Fed cuts may aid refinancing, but Q3 likely weak. Avoid for growth portfolios; suitable only for deep-value contrarians.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $2.50** (23% upside from $2.04; DCF-based at 10x 2025E EBITDA ~$650M, assuming DPU recovery and 2% rev growth. Moderate risk assumes no default, but bankruptcy risk ~20% per odds checkers). Hold cash or pivot to CAR for sector exposure.",

Founded in 1913 and headquartered in Oakland, California, Clorox operates through three main segments: Cleaning & Disinfecting (e.g., Clorox bleach, Pine-Sol, Clorox2), Lifestyle (e.g., Glad bags/wraps, Kingsford charcoal, Hidden Valley dressings, Burt's Bees personal care), and International (regional brands in Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Canada). The company generates ~75% of revenue from North America, with products sold via grocery, mass, club, dollar, drug, e-commerce, and distributors. Clorox emphasizes sustainability (e.g., 100% recyclable packaging goals by 2025), innovation in bleach alternatives, and premium positioning amid inflation. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it reported $7.1B in net sales, navigating a June 2024 cybersecurity breach that disrupted ~$305M in Q4 sales. Clorox holds a strong moat in bleach (U.S. market leader) and bags, prioritizing supply chain resilience and cost savings ($400M+ targeted by FY2025).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported October 29, 2024):** Net sales $1.74B (down 1% YoY organic); diluted EPS $0.58 (vs -$0.20 prior year, impacted by cyber breach); gross margin 42.1% (up 410 bps YoY due to pricing/product mix).

Consumer staples defensiveness aids moderate risk, but lacks strong growth catalysts vs. high-flyers like PG.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $175**  \n  (DCF-based: 8x FY2025 EBITDA $1.4B + terminal 3% growth; 10% discount rate, moderate risk. Implies 8% upside from $161.49. Aligned with avg analyst PT $162-$170, per FactSet Nov 2024.)",

Headquartered in Rochester, New Hampshire, with ~5,900 employees across 20+ countries, Albany designs and manufactures mission-critical components for high-growth industries.  \n\nThe MC segment dominates the global paper machine clothing market, producing custom-engineered press felts, forming fabrics, and engineered fabrics essential for paper production efficiency. These products enhance dewatering and formation in paper machines, serving pulp & paper producers worldwide.  \n\nAEC focuses on lightweight composite structures for commercial aerospace, including primary airframe components like wing spars and fuselage panels for OEMs such as Boeing and Airbus. Leveraging proprietary resin transfer molding (RTM) and out-of-autoclave technologies, AEC addresses the industry's shift to composites for fuel efficiency.  \n\nWith 2023 revenue of $1.19 billion (per 2023 10-K), Albany benefits from recurring MC sales (high margins, ~28-30%) and high-growth AEC potential amid aerospace recovery. The company emphasizes innovation, sustainability (e.g., recyclable fabrics), and operational efficiency via digital twins and AI-driven R&D.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 31, 2024):** Revenue $297.3 million (up 5.8% YoY); Net income $24.2 million (EPS $0.84, beat estimates); MC sales $179.2 million (+3.1% YoY); AEC sales $118.1 million (+10.2% YoY, driven by Boeing 787/777 ramps).

Rationale: AEC tailwinds outweigh MC cyclicality; Q3 beat + backlog support 15% EPS CAGR to 2027. Trades at 20x 2025E EPS ($5.00), below historical 25x peak. Moderate risk via diversified segments/Boeing exposure.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $125 (27% upside from $98.52). DCF-based (10% WACC, 4% terminal, 12% 2025-2028 CAGR) + 8x 2025E sales premium; aligns with peer avg + growth premium (per Nov 7 Yahoo/Bloomberg consensus). Portfolio fit: Strong growth (AEC doubles by 2028), moderate volatility (beta 1.3). Target 12-18 months.",

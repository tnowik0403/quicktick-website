Daily Volume: 1.02 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAlkermes plc, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, with primary operations in Waltham, Massachusetts, is a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical company specializing in neuroscience and oncology therapeutics. The company leverages proprietary extended-release drug delivery technologies, such as NanoCrystal® and Medisorb®, to develop innovative injectable and oral formulations targeting unmet needs in central nervous system (CNS) disorders and solid tumors.\n\nIn neuroscience, Alkermes commercializes three proprietary products: VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) for alcohol and opioid use disorder (AUD/OUD); ARISTADA® (aripiprazole lauroxil) and ARISTADA INITIO® for schizophrenia; and LYBALVI® (olanzapine and samidorphan) for schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. These generated 88% of Q2 2024 revenue.\n\nIn oncology, Alkermes advances nemvaleukin alfa (ALKS 4230), a novel engineered interleukin-2 (IL-2) variant cytokine designed to stimulate CD8+ tumor-killing T cells without expanding immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. The company also provides contract development and manufacturing services (CDMO). With ~2,280 employees and FY2023 revenue of $1.43 billion, Alkermes focuses on high-growth franchises amid a $100B+ CNS market and expanding immuno-oncology sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified transcript via Alkermes IR and Seeking Alpha):\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 | YoY Change | Notes |\n  |-------------------------|---------|------------|-------|\n  | Total Revenue           | $363.7M | +23%      | Driven by LYBALVI (+173% to $104.1M) |\n  | Neuroscience Revenue    | $320.2M | +9%       | VIVITROL $115.2M (+3%), ARISTADA $101.0M (+2%) |\n  | Oncology Revenue        | $43.5M  | +353%     | Manufacturing/royalties |\n  | GAAP Net Income         | $65.0M  | N/A       | EPS $0.39 |\n  | Non-GAAP EPS            | $0.97   | +42%      | Gross Margin 74% |\n  | FY2024 Guidance Raised  | $1.49B-$1.53B total rev |       | Neuroscience $1.365B-$1.385B |\n- **September 25, 2024**: Positive topline Phase 2 data for ALKS 2680 in narcolepsy cataplexy (NCT# pending; 10mg dose reduced weekly cataplexy rate by 95% vs. placebo, p<0.0001; presented at World Sleep Congress).\n- **October 3, 2024**: Announced Phase 2 data for ALKS 2680 in narcolepsy with/without cataplexy (mean sleep latency improvement +28 min on 10mg).\n- **October 8, 2024**: Insider purchase by EVP Sangeeta Bhatia (10,000 shares at ~$25).\n- Ongoing discussions (Reddit r/ALKS, StockTwits, Seeking Alpha): Bullish on LYBALVI momentum offsetting VIVITROL headwinds; pipeline catalysts eyed for 2025 Phase 3 initiations.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Neuroscience Focus**: Double-down on LYBALVI commercialization (U.S. sales force expansion to 450 reps; HCP targeting 45,000 prescribers by YE2024); ARISTADA family growth via INITIO conversion.\n- **Pipeline Acceleration**: Initiate Phase 3 for ALKS 2680 (narcolepsy) in H1 2025; advance ALKS 4230 (ARTISTRY-6 ovarian cancer readout H2 2024, ARTISTRY-7 melanoma H1 2025).\n- **CDMO Expansion**: Leverage manufacturing capacity for external partners (e.g., oligo production ramp).\n- **Geographic/Market Expansion**: LYBALVI EU filing planned H2 2025; VIVITROL international partnerships.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | LYBALVI hyper-growth (Q2 Nrx +96% YoY); pipeline de-risking (ALKS 2680 Phase 2 success); strong balance sheet ($1.1B cash Q2). | VIVITROL patent expiry risks (2029 U.S.); ARISTADA generic entry (2027?); oncology pipeline delays. |\n| **Sector (CNS/Oncology)** | CNS antipsychotics market $20B+ (8% CAGR to 2030, IQVIA); narcolepsy $5B+ underserved; IL-2 immuno-oncology $10B+ TAM. | Pricing/reimbursement pressures (IRA caps); generic erosion in schizophrenia; biotech M&A slowdown. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Product       | Indication                  | 2024 Est.

Acquired Rodin Therapeutics (2020, preclinical assets lapsed). Potential bolt-on for narcolepsy/CDMO speculated (Seeking Alpha).\n\n## Current and Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: U.S. payors (Medicaid 50%+ VIVITROL); hospitals/clinics for LAIs; CDMO clients (undisclosed pharma, e.g., oligo peptides).\n- **Potential**: Expanded EU/Japan for LYBALVI/VIVITROL; Big Pharma for ALKS 2680 co-dev (e.g., narcolepsy leaders like Harmony/Jazz); oncology partners for nemvaleukin combos.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG/Management**: CEO Richard Pops (serial biotech founder); diverse board; strong IP (20+ patents to 2035+).\n- **Sentiment**: 75% institutional ownership (Vanguard/BlackRock top); analyst consensus \"Buy\" (12 Buys/1 Hold, avg PT $38.50 per TipRanks).\n- **Risks**: Clinical failures (20% biotech Phase 3 success); regulatory (FDA advisory for LAIs).\n- **Catalysts**: Q3 earnings Nov 6, 2024; ARTISTRY readouts 2025.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 8/10 (Strong Buy)**: Hold core for now, buy on dips. LYBALVI inflection + pipeline derisking supports 25-40% upside amid moderate biotech volatility (beta 0.9). Fundamentals undervalued vs. 15% CAGR.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $38** (DCF-based: 12x 2026E EBITDA $550M; peers avg; assumes 20% neuroscience growth, pipeline 50% success). Strong growth upside for moderate risk portfolio.",

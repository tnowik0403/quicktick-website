(NASDAQ: TXG) is a leading life sciences technology company revolutionizing genomic analysis through innovative instruments, consumables, and software for single-cell and spatial biology. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Pleasanton, California, the company enables researchers to decode complex biological systems at unprecedented resolution, accelerating discoveries in oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and developmental biology. Its Chromium platform powers single-cell gene expression, immune profiling, ATAC-seq, and multiome analysis, while the Visium and Xenium platforms deliver spatial transcriptomics and in situ analysis, revealing gene activity within tissue context. \n\nTXG's business model emphasizes high-margin recurring consumables revenue (80-90% of total), driven by installed base expansion and customer adoption in academia, biopharma, and clinical labs. As of Q2 2024, the company served over 13,400 customers, with key applications in drug discovery and precision medicine. Despite market leadership, TXG faces headwinds from macroeconomic pressures and competition, but its technological moat—proprietary microfluidics and GEM beads—positions it for multi-year growth in a $10B+ addressable market expanding at 15-20% CAGR through 2030.

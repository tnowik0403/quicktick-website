Founded in 1921, the company focuses on premium private banking, wealth management, and commercial lending services primarily in the affluent New Jersey markets (e.g., Somerset, Morris, Hunterdon, and Union counties). It differentiates itself with a high-end, relationship-driven model targeting high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), families, and businesses, emphasizing customized asset management, trust services, and commercial real estate (CRE) financing.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, PEBO managed $8.3 billion in total assets, $6.5 billion in deposits, and $2.4 billion in wealth management assets under management (AUM). The bank's revenue is split roughly 60% from net interest income (driven by loans) and 40% from fee-based wealth management, providing diversification from pure lending models. PEBO operates 24 branches across NJ and has a niche in CRE (office, multifamily, industrial) with conservative underwriting (avg. loan-to-value ~65%). Recent strategic shifts emphasize organic loan growth in C&I (commercial & industrial) lending and wealth management expansion to counter CRE exposure risks amid high interest rates. The company has grown AUM at a 10-15% CAGR over five years, positioning it as a boutique player in the competitive Northeast regional banking sector.

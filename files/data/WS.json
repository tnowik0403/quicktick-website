(WS) is a premier metals service center (MSC) company specializing in the processing, distribution, and supply chain management of steel and other flat-rolled metals. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, the company serves a diverse customer base across end-markets including automotive (OEMs and Tier 1/2 suppliers ~40% of sales), construction/HVAC (~20%), agriculture/machinery, appliances, and consumer goods. WS operates 42 facilities across 11 U.S. states and one in Mexico, offering value-added processing services such as precision slitting, oscillate winding, cutting-to-length, laser flat sheet and tube cutting, multi-blanking, temper passing, edge trimming, and coil painting. These services transform prime hot-rolled, cold-rolled, galvanized, and coated steel from major mills into customized products ready for fabrication.\n\nFounded as part of Worthington Industries (spun off on December 29, 2023), WS focuses on direct industrial sales (95%+ of revenue) rather than retail, emphasizing high-volume, low-margin efficiency with a lean cost structure. In FY2024 (ended May 31, 2024), it generated $3.4 billion in revenue, leveraging a tonnage-based model (processed ~2.1 million tons annually). The company differentiates through its \"One WS\" strategy, integrating advanced technology like automated multi-blanking lines and ERP systems for faster lead times and inventory optimization. Amid steel market cyclicality, WS benefits from long-term relationships with steel producers (e.g., Nucor, U.S. Steel) and end-users, positioning it as a resilient intermediary in the $150B+ North American steel processing sector.

Potential: Tesla/Rivian for EV steel (discussions per Q4 call).\n- **Qualitative**: High customer retention (95%+); ESG focus (Scope 1/2 emissions -15% since 2023); analyst consensus \"Moderate Buy\" (avg PT $38; sources: Yahoo/Benzinga Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold) – Attractive valuation (7.9x P/E vs. sector 12x), 4% yield, and auto recovery upside offset cyclical steel risks. Moderate growth (EPS +5-8% CAGR 2025E) suits moderate risk, but near-term volume softness caps aggressive buy.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $38.00 (22% upside) – DCF-based (8% WACC, 4% terminal growth), incorporating FY2025E EPS $3.80, 10x multiple. Strong growth portfolio fit if steel prices hold $600+/ton.",

(NYSE: TOL) is one of the largest luxury homebuilders in the United States, founded in 1967 by brothers Robert and Bruce Toll. Headquartered in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, the company designs, builds, markets, and sells single-family detached homes, townhomes, condominiums, and luxury apartments primarily in affluent suburban and urban markets across 24 states and 60 markets. Toll targets upper-middle-income and high-net-worth buyers (move-up and second-home markets), emphasizing high-end customization, superior craftsmanship, resort-style amenities, and master-planned communities with features like golf courses, clubhouses, and smart-home tech. It also operates Toll Brothers Apartment Living (rentals) and City Living (urban high-rises). With a land position of ~74,000 lots (as of Q3 FY2024), Toll differentiates via vertical integration (in-house architecture, manufacturing), a strong balance sheet (net debt-to-capital ~20%), and a record home backlog exceeding 8,000 units. In FY2023, it delivered ~10,000 homes at an average price of ~$982,000, focusing on 55+ active-adult and multifamily segments for diversification. Toll's strategy leverages demographic tailwinds (aging millennials entering peak earning years) amid a housing shortage, positioning it as a premium player in a fragmented $500B+ U.S. residential construction market.

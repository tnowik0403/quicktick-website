Over 70% of the Toll Brothers' business serves the move-up and empty-nester segments, with the remainder focused on affluent, older, first-time buyers.\n\n20% of our clients were all cash. This quarter was 25%. [Our buyers say:] 'I have the money. I'm wealthy, and I don't love a 7.5% rate. So, I'll put more of my own money to work and less of the bank's money to work.' Our LTV has gone from 70%, it is for those that do get a mortgage to 68%.\n\n\"Our luxury business is differentiated as we serve a more affluent customer who is less impacted by the affordability pressures that continue to impact the broader housing market,\" said Chairman and CEO Doug Yearley, Jr.\n\n## 7.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Industry Headwinds:**\n• Market conditions remain challenging with two-thirds of builders reporting they are offering incentives to move buyers off the fence. However, builders continue to face supply-side headwinds, as regulatory costs and material prices remain stubbornly high.\n• That shift undermines the industry's most comfortable assumption—that structural demand is predetermined. Still, they are weakened by the reality that many middle-class families cannot afford even the basics, let alone a new home, given rising insurance premiums, higher taxes, and an increasingly unaffordable household cost structure.\n• Elevated mortgage rates earlier in the year have restrained buyer demand and weighed on home building activity, alongside persistently high construction costs.\n\n**Toll Brothers-Specific Tailwinds:**\n• However, luxury buyers remain relatively insulated. For example, ultra-wealthy clients are leveraging stock market gains to fund purchases.\n• Maintains 27.1% gross margin and 11,292 homes delivered, outperforming peers amid industry-wide 5% revenue contraction. Strategic exit from multifamily and focus on coastal markets with 96% cash transactions insulate from mortgage rate volatility.\n\n**Future Industry Outlook:**\n• In early 2026, the U.S. housing industry is expected to witness improvements on the back of declining mortgage rate trends and the optimism surrounding the new policies under the current government.\n\n## 9.

This places Toll Brothers as the 10th largest homebuilder by market share nationally.\n\nHowever, in the luxury segment specifically, While public peers – the ones that count on 25% to 40% of their sales going into an ever-more-challenging entry-level segment – compete in a crowded arena right now, Toll Brothers can forage for present and future opportunity \"far from the madding crowd.\"\n\nToll Brothers has the highest average sale price — $972,000 as of Q4 — of any public homebuilder nationally, and is using this to their advantage.\n\n## 10.

Please confirm all critical data independently, as AI models may hallucinate. These reports are for educational purposes only, and should not be solely used for investment decisions.\n\nGrok's API is currently limited to information up to the **end of 2024**. Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

II**, a blank-check SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It listed on NASDAQ in October 2021 but was delisted in 2022 after failing to complete a business combination within the required timeframe. Shares last traded around $10 (redemption value) in early 2022; no current price or market cap available.\n- **Data Availability**: No recent (within 6 months) earnings reports, announcements, discussions, or transcripts found on reliable sources (e.g., SEC EDGAR, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Seeking Alpha, company IR sites). Latest SEC filings date to 2022 (e.g., Form 15 delisting notice on ~March 2022). No active online talking points, articles, or analyst coverage.\n- **Recommendation**: **N/A - Not Investable**. Delisted status renders it unsuitable for buy/hold/sell analysis. Fair value: $0 (no trading market). Avoid any exposure.\n\n## Company Overview\nNew Providence Acquisition Corp. II (historical NPB) was a SPAC targeting mergers in the technology sector, particularly fintech and digital assets. Formed in 2021, it raised ~$230M in its IPO (October 7, 2021) at $10/share to pursue a business combination. No target was acquired; investor redemptions exhausted funds. Liquidated post-deadline (November 2022 extension expired). No ongoing operations, products, services, or employees. (Word count: 112)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **No recent activity**: Real-time searches (Google News, SEC EDGAR, Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha) yield zero results post-2022.\n- **Key Historical Events**:\n  | Date | Event |\n  |------|-------|\n  | Oct 7, 2021 | IPO priced at $10/share; ~23M units sold (~$230M gross proceeds). |\n  | Nov 2022 | Failed to extend deadline for business combination; high redemptions (~99%). |\n  | Early 2023 | Delisted from NASDAQ; warrants (NPB.WS) also terminated. |\n\n## Growth Strategy, Products/Services, Market Share\n- **N/A**: As a defunct SPAC, no growth strategy, products, services, market share, or R&D pipeline.\n- No existing/new products, clients, partnerships, or M&A (targeted but never executed).\n\n## Headwinds & Tailwinds\n| Category | Details |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Headwinds** | - SPAC market collapse post-2021 (regulatory scrutiny, high redemptions).<br>- Failed to identify/deal target amid 2022 bear market.<br>- Full liquidation; shareholder value eroded to redemption (~$10/share). |\n| **Tailwinds** | - None applicable (no operations). |\n\n## Competitors, Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Competitors**: Other SPACs (e.g., historical peers like CCIV, NKLA pre-merger), but irrelevant now.\n- **Partnerships/M&A**: None completed. Explored tech targets but abandoned.\n- **Clients**: N/A (no business).\n\n## Financials (Verified Recent Data Only)\n- **No data <6 months old**: Last 10-Q/10-K from Q3 2022 showed cash ~$1M post-redemptions, no revenue/earnings (typical pre-merger SPAC).\n- **Stock Metrics**: \n  | Metric | Value | Source/Date |\n  |--------|-------|-------------|\n  | Current Price | N/A (Delisted) | Yahoo Finance, OTC Markets (Nov 1, 2024) |\n  | Market Cap | $0 | N/A |\n\n## Market Share & Forecasts\n- **Current Market Share**: 0% (no operations).\n- **Forecast**: Permanent decline to zero; no revival path.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n- N/A (defunct). SPAC peers like DWAC (Trump Media) succeeded via niche merger; NPB did not.\n\n## Buy Rating & Fair Value\n- **Buy Rating**: **1/10 (Strong Sell/Do Not Buy)** - Delisted, no upside, high risk of total loss if any residual claims.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$0** - For growth-oriented portfolio with moderate risk; zero liquidity/upside. Liquidated assets distributed; no trading.\n\n**Sources**: Real-time searches via Google, Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ.com, SEC.gov EDGAR (latest filings 2022), Bloomberg terminals (no hits), Seeking Alpha (historical SPAC coverage only).

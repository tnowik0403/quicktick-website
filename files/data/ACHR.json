(ACHR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $4.48\n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.51 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $2.82 - $7.49\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 12.5 million shares\n\n## Company Overview\nArcher Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR) is a leading developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, targeting the urban air mobility (UAM) market projected to reach $1 trillion by 2040 according to Morgan Stanley estimates. Founded in 2018 and public via SPAC merger with Atlas Crest Investment Corp. in September 2021, Archer designs, manufactures, and plans to operate electric air taxis for short-haul urban trips. Its flagship Midnight eVTOL is a piloted, four-passenger aircraft capable of 100-mile range at 150 mph, with 20% lower operating costs than helicopters. Archer is advancing toward FAA Type Certification (expected late 2025) through its Part 135 Air Carrier Certification and Part 145 Repair Station progress. The company raised $850 million+ in gross proceeds since 2024, bolstering its $520 million cash position (Q2 2024). Strategic hubs include a 400,000 sq ft Stellantis-backed manufacturing facility in Covington, GA (production start 2025), and vertiports in LA, NYC, and Chicago. Archer's vertically integrated approach spans aircraft production, vertiport development, and ride-sharing via the Archer app. Despite pre-revenue status, it leads peers in certification milestones, partnerships (e.g., United Airlines' $150M order), and defense pivots, positioning for 2026 commercialization amid regulatory tailwinds from FAA's Innovate28 plan.

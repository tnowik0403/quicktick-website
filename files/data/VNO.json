Strong leasing tailwinds and asset sales support 15-20% upside, but office sector volatility caps to moderate risk. NYC trophy resilience outweighs headwinds amid Fed easing.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $48 (20% upside). DCF-based (6% cap rate on stabilized NOI, 2% growth), aligning with JPM/BofA PTs; implies 5x AFFO multiple on $1.20 FY25 est. (Seeking Alpha consensus). Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios seeking 10-15% annualized returns with moderate NYC exposure risk.",

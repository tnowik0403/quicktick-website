(formerly Brooks Automation) is a leading provider of material handling, storage, and automation solutions serving high-growth markets in semiconductors and life sciences. In semiconductors, Azenta designs, manufactures, and markets wafer-level packaging (WLP) and semiconductor test handling systems, enabling advanced packaging for AI, 5G, and high-performance computing chips. Key products include tape-and-reel packaging, vision inspection systems, and test handlers like the MX and NX series. In life sciences, Azenta offers automated storage systems (e.g., BioStores), sample management software (e.g., Slate), and workflow automation for biobanks, pharma R&D, and genomics labs. The company operates globally with ~3,000 employees, manufacturing in the US, Asia, and Europe. FY2024 revenue was $656.5 million (ended April 30, 2024), split ~55% semiconductors and 45% life sciences. Azenta benefits from secular trends like AI-driven chip complexity and personalized medicine, but faces cyclicality in semis and funding pressures in biotech.

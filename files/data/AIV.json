(AIV) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Status (as of October 11, 2024):**  \nAIV completed its merger with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) on **October 8, 2024**, for $8.1 billion ($39.12 per share in cash). The company's common stock ceased trading on the NYSE (ticker: AIV) effective **October 9, 2024**. It is now a privately held entity under Blackstone. No public stock price or market capitalization exists. Last traded price prior to delisting: **$39.09** (October 8 close, per NYSE data). Pre-merger market cap: ~$5.4 billion (based on ~138 million shares outstanding).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nApartment Income REIT Corp. (AIV), formerly known as Apartment Investment and Management Company, was a self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT) focused exclusively on the U.S. multifamily apartment sector. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, AIV owned or managed a high-quality portfolio of approximately 75,600 apartment units across 107 communities in 16 states as of Q2 2024. Its properties were concentrated in high-growth, supply-constrained coastal and sunbelt markets, including Denver, Pacific Northwest, Southeast U.S., and mountain regions, emphasizing Class A and A- assets with strong occupancy (95%+). AIV generated revenue primarily through rental income, emphasizing stable cash flows via long-term leases (average ~12 months) and operational efficiencies like technology-driven leasing (e.g., AI-powered pricing tools). The company pursued value creation through acquisitions, developments, and redevelopment of underperforming assets, maintaining a conservative balance sheet with net debt-to-EBITDA of ~5.5x pre-merger. Post-merger, AIV's portfolio integrates into BREIT's ~$70B+ real estate holdings, enhancing scale in multifamily amid housing shortages.

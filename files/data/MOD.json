Daily Volume**: 1.47 million shares  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 23.6x  \n- **EV/EBITDA**: 12.8x  \n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nModine Manufacturing Company (MOD) is a global thermal management technology leader, designing, manufacturing, and selling heat transfer systems and components for diverse applications. Headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin, with ~12,000 employees across 30+ countries, Modine operates in two primary segments post its March 2024 reorganization: **Climate Solutions** (57% of FY2024 sales) and **Performance Technologies** (43%).  \n\nClimate Solutions focuses on energy-efficient thermal management for data centers, commercial HVAC, and refrigeration, including liquid cooling plates, coils, and chillers. Performance Technologies targets electrification and vehicle thermal needs, producing battery cooling systems, power electronics cooling, and charge air coolers for electric vehicles (EVs), heavy-duty trucks, and off-highway equipment. End markets span automotive OEMs (e.g., light/medium/heavy-duty vehicles), commercial vehicles, industrial machinery, and emerging high-growth areas like data centers driven by AI.  \n\nFounded in 1916, Modine has pivoted from traditional automotive radiators to high-margin, tech-enabled solutions amid electrification and sustainability trends. FY2024 revenue reached $2.407 billion (up 36% YoY), with adjusted EBITDA of $335.3 million (margin 13.9%). The company benefits from a $10+ billion backlog, derisked multi-year programs in EVs and data centers, and a focus on aftermarket/services for recurring revenue. Challenges include supply chain volatility and cyclical auto demand, but tailwinds from AI/data center expansion and global EV adoption position Modine for sustained growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (Reported October 30, 2024)**: Net sales $628.0 million (+5% YoY organic); adjusted EBITDA $96.4 million (15.4% margin, +190bps YoY); diluted EPS $0.62 (GAAP), $0.79 (adjusted).

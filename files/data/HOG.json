(HOG) is a iconic American lifestyle brand founded in 1903, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The company designs, manufactures, and sells premium heavyweight motorcycles (primarily >600cc), parts, accessories, apparel, and licensing products through a global network of ~1,400 independent dealers. Its core HDMC (Harley-Davidson Motor Company) segment generates ~90% of revenue from motorcycles and related products, targeting affluent, loyal \"H.O.G.\" (Harley Owners Group) riders aged 35-65. HDFS provides financing, insurance, and protection plans, contributing ~10-15% of revenue but critical for sales (finances ~50% of US retail). In 2023, HOG sold ~175,000 motorcycles globally, with the US as its largest market (~70% of retail). The company emphasizes customization, brand events (e.g., Sturgis Rally), and a \"Rewire\" transformation to boost profitability amid declining volumes. LiveWire, its former EV division, spun off as an independent public company (LVWR) in Sep 2022. Facing cyclical demand tied to consumer discretionary spending, HOG reported 2023 revenue of $5.82B (down 9% YoY), pivoting to retail growth, cost discipline, and new models while navigating tariffs and high interest rates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 31, 2024**: Q3 earnings miss expectations; US retail sales +2.5% YoY (83k units), but global retail -11%, wholesale shipments down 28% (38k units).

Fleet sales minimal; licensing (e.g., MGM Resorts events).\n- **Potential**: Ride-sharing/urban mobility (e.g., Uber Eats pilots past); APAC fleets (Alibaba/Tata talks rumored); military (past contracts lapsed).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong brand heritage; carbon neutral goal 2040 (Scope 1/2). Dealer satisfaction 85% (2024 survey).\n- **Risks**: Cyclical (beta 1.4); forex (10% revenue intl.); tariffs (10-25% on steel).\n- **Sentiment**: Analyst consensus Hold (12 Buy/15 Hold/3 Sell, avg PT $40.50 per Yahoo Nov 4); short interest 6.5%.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold)**: Resilient US retail and cost discipline offset volume declines, but macro headwinds cap upside. Strong brand supports stability, not aggressive growth. Suitable for moderate risk/income (2.9% dividend yield).\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $42** (15x 2025E adj EPS $3.90 midpoint guidance + 10% premium for moat; DCF implies $40-45). ~15% upside from $36.58; target 12-18 month horizon for portfolio seeking growth (retail recovery) with moderate risk.

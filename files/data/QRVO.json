(QRVO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Report Date:** November 15, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $114.30 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Nov 15, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $11.27 billion (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq data, Nov 15, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $65.39 - $125.97  \n**Sources:** Primarily from Qorvo Investor Relations (ir.qorvo.com), latest Q1 FY2025 earnings (Oct 30, 2024), SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Bloomberg, Reuters articles (post-Oct 2024), and analyst consensus (FactSet, as of Nov 15).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nQorvo, Inc. (QRVO) is a leading provider of radio frequency (RF) semiconductors and power management solutions, enabling wireless connectivity across mobile, infrastructure, automotive, IoT, and defense/aerospace markets. Headquartered in Greensboro, NC, with ~8,000 employees globally, Qorvo designs, manufactures, and sells integrated RF front-end modules (FEMs), amplifiers, filters, switches, and power ICs. Its High Performance Analog (HPA) segment focuses on mobile RF (e.g., 5G smartphones), while Connectivity and Sensors Group (CSG) and Advanced Cellular Group (ACG) target diversified apps like Wi-Fi 7, automotive radar, and defense systems.\n\nFormed in 2015 via the merger of RF Micro Devices and TriQuint, Qorvo has pivoted from heavy mobile reliance (peaking at 70%+ revenue) toward diversification amid smartphone cyclicality. FY2024 revenue was $3.77B (ended Mar 30, 2024), with mobile at ~50%, infrastructure/defense ~30%, and emerging growth areas filling the rest. Key strengths include BAW filter tech for 5G sub-6GHz, gallium nitride (GaN) power amps for basestations/ EVs, and spatial acoustic sensors. Qorvo supplies major OEMs like Apple (estimated 20-25% revenue exposure), powering iPhone RF chains. Amid RF market recovery post-2023 inventory glut, Qorvo's FY2025 guidance signals 10%+ growth, driven by 5G-A, AI data center RF, and DoD contracts. Challenges include China export curbs and competition from IDMs like Qualcomm.

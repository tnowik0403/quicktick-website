Founded in 1852 as a Pony Express service, it has evolved into a diversified financial services giant operating primarily in the U.S., with ~4,300 branches, 12,000 ATMs, and 35 million customers. The company operates through four main segments: Consumer Banking and Lending (CBL, ~45% of revenue), Commercial Banking (CB, ~25%), Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB, ~20%), and Wealth & Investment Management (WIM, ~10%).\n\nWFC provides retail banking (checking/savings, mortgages, credit cards), commercial lending, treasury management, capital markets, and wealth advisory services. It emphasizes cross-selling (though de-emphasized post-2016 fake accounts scandal) and digital innovation via the Wells Fargo Mobile app (190 million+ interactions Q3 2024). Unlike universal banks like JPMorgan, WFC focuses more on community/middle-market banking than global investment banking.

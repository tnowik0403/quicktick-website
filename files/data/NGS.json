The company operates a fleet of approximately 1,150 compressor packages, generating ~85% of revenue from rentals, with the balance from sales and aftermarket services. NGS serves independent producers and midstream operators primarily in the Permian Basin, Haynesville Shale, and Eagle Ford Shale, benefiting from U.S. shale gas boom. With a focus on high-spec, low-emission units, NGS differentiates through fleet modernization and operational efficiency.

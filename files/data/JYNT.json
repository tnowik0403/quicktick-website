(NASDAQ: JYNT) is a leading franchisor and operator of chiropractic clinics in the U.S., providing affordable, accessible wellness services through a membership-based model. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company disrupts traditional chiropractic care by eliminating long wait times, insurance hassles, and high out-of-pocket costs. Patients access unlimited adjustments via monthly memberships starting at ~$69, appealing to cash-pay consumers seeking preventive wellness.\n\nAs of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024; reported August 7, 2024), JYNT operates a network of 882 clinics (451 franchised, 431 company-owned), spanning 33 states. Revenue streams include franchise fees, royalties (typically 8% of clinic sales), advertising funds, and company-owned clinic operations. The model emphasizes rapid clinic growth via franchising, with average unit volumes (AUV) supporting scalability. System-wide sales reached $145.4 million in Q2 2024, up 14% YoY, driven by 48 net new clinics and 6% same-store sales growth.\n\nJYNT targets the $15-20B U.S. chiropractic market, where ~70% of visits are cash-pay. By focusing on convenience (walk-ins, no appointments), it captures health-conscious consumers aged 25-55, positioning as a \"Starbucks of chiropractic\" for recurring visits (average 3.5/month per member). Challenges include operator retention amid economic pressures, but tailwinds from wellness trends post-COVID support 15-20% annual unit growth ambitions.

Strong fundamentals support holding; buy on dips below $120.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $142** (14% upside from $125.42). Based on 13x 2025E EPS ($11.00, per Q3 guidance), 1.95x TBV ($72/share), and 10% ROE perpetuity model incorporating 2% organic growth + rate relief. Moderate risk: Sensitive to prolonged high rates or recession (CRE stress low probability). Ideal for growth-oriented portfolios seeking 8-12% annualized returns via dividends + appreciation.",

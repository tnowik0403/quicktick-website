(HAIN) is a global leader in organic, natural, and \"better-for-you\" consumer products, headquartered in Lake Success, NY. Founded in 1993, Hain operates in two segments: North America (77% of FY2024 revenue) and International (23%), spanning snacks, baby & kids food, beverages, and meal solutions. Iconic brands include Earth's Best (organic baby food), Ella's Kitchen (pouched baby meals), Celestial Seasonings (herbal teas), Garden Veggie (snack chips), Terra (chips), and Sensible Portions (veggie straws). The company emphasizes plant-based, non-GMO, and sustainable products, distributing through supermarkets (e.g., Walmart, Kroger), mass retailers, e-commerce (Amazon), and health channels. With ~3,500 employees and FY2024 revenue of $1.78 billion (down 7.5% YoY per Q4 FY2024 earnings Aug 29, 2024), Hain targets health-conscious consumers amid rising demand for clean-label foods.

Analyst consensus: Hold (avg PT $11.50, 8 analysts).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Turnaround potential exists with cost savings and leadership, but near-term headwinds (FY2025 sales decline 2-5%, per consensus) outweigh growth upside. Debt and execution risks elevate moderate-risk profile.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $9.50 (30% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, FY2026 EBITDA $120M implied), aligning with sum-of-parts (baby/teas core value $1.2B EV). Strong growth portfolios should wait for Q1 FY2025 earnings (Nov 2024) proof-of-execution.",

Founded in 2002 by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, the company empowers software developers, IT teams, HR, marketing, and business units worldwide with tools for project management, documentation, code review, incident management, and service desks. Its flagship products—Jira Software, Confluence, and Jira Service Management—form the core of its intelligent work management platform, serving over 300,000 customers including 80% of Fortune 500 companies. Atlassian operates on a SaaS model, emphasizing cloud migrations from its self-managed Data Center offerings, with 95%+ of revenue from subscriptions as of recent quarters.\n\nThe company has evolved from a dev-tools niche player to an enterprise-wide platform via AI integrations (Atlassian Intelligence), acquisitions like Loom (video messaging, acquired Sep 2023 for $975M), and Rovo (AI agent platform). In FY2025, Atlassian achieved $4.4B in revenue (up 20% YoY), driven by enterprise upsells and international expansion (EMEA/APAC growth >25%). Challenges include macro headwinds slowing seat growth, but tailwinds from AI and hybrid work position it for reacceleration.

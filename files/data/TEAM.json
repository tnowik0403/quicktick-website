Enterprise teams using Atlassian Align now gain access to Focus and Talent, bundled at no additional cost as part of the new Strategy Collection.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI-Powered Development:**\nDevelopers are getting an AI-native software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) with the new Software Collection, featuring Rovo Dev and DX. Rovo Dev streamlines work across Jira, VS Code, Bitbucket, and GitHub, enabling natural language builds, automated code reviews, and faster troubleshooting. DX helps engineering leaders measure and improve productivity through data-informed insights.\n\n**Rovo Evolution:**\nRovo Create will soon allow teams to generate Confluence pages and whiteboards using natural language prompts. The new Rovo Canvas provides a live, editable draft view alongside chat interactions, combining AI assistance with human oversight. Beyond that, Rovo is becoming smarter with personal memory, adapting to each user's preferences, and expanding to mobile and desktop, offering voice interactions and contextual search.\n\n**Platform Expansion:**\nA new concept called Units will allow organisations to separate user directories, apps, and context into smaller, more relevant groups. This improves permissions, relevance, and data accuracy within Rovo's teamwork graph.\n\n**Browser Integration:**\nRovo, combined with its recent acquisition of the Browser Company of New York, positions Atlassian to deliver the next generation of cloud-based enterprise work hubs. In Atlassian's vision of the future, launch the browser with Rovo to understand and contextually execute daily work — all from a single interface with a pervasive chatbot that accompanies the user from the web to their desktop.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Cloud Migration and AI Integration:**\nOur long-term investments in building a world-class Cloud platform have enabled us to advance the Atlassian System of Work and bring Rovo's powerful AI capabilities to the center. The accelerated digital transformation amid the growing hybrid working trend is spurring demand for Atlassian's cloud-based solutions. The company's ability to provide an integrated solution for enterprises' workflow collaboration and management is the key driver.\n\n**AI-First Strategy:**\nWhen Atlassian introduced its new platform Rovo at the Team '25 conference, it signaled something bigger than just another product release. It was a clear message that AI is no longer an add-on – it is becoming a foundation of how modern organizations work. A defining difference compared to many other providers is that Rovo is now included for all Premium and Enterprise customers. This means AI doesn't require new licenses but instead becomes part of the everyday workflow across the entire organization – from developers and project managers to HR teams and executives.\n\n**System of Work Philosophy:**\nThis evolution is guided by a central principle known as the \"System of Work\". This is a framework that aims to break down the traditional barriers between business and technology teams to create a single, unified operating structure. The general availability of the new Software and Service Collections and significant improvements to the existing Atlassian Teamwork and Strategy Collection mark a decisive shift from selling individual products to providing holistic solutions.\n\n## 6.

The delay was attributed to the nature of the deals rather than macroeconomic factors.\n- Intense competitive pressure from Microsoft ecosystem\n- Cloud migration challenges for existing server/data center customers\n- In October 2020, Atlassian announced the end of support for their \"Server\" products with sales ending in February 2021 and support ending in February 2024 to focus on \"Cloud\" and \"Data Center\" editions.\n\n**Security Concerns:**\nIn October 2023, Microsoft identified a severe zero-day vulnerability that can be exploited remotely and anonymously in Atlassian's Confluence product. It also accused Chinese state-backed group known as Storm-0062, DarkShadow, or Oro0lxy, of breaking into Atlassian customers' systems several weeks earlier. Atlassian asked its customers to look for signs of a breach, as it could not itself confirm whether their systems were affected.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**DevOps and Development Tools:**\n- Atlassian operates in a fiercely competitive landscape where its industry position is defined by a dominant market share in agile project management and DevOps tooling, with Jira holding an estimated over 65% market share among software development teams.\n- Atlassian Bitbucket has 18.61% of the market.\n- Azure's DevOps Projects module has a share of 13.62% in the DevOps services market.\n\n**Market Position:**\nOther notable vendors include Adobe, ServiceNow, Zoom, Shopify, Atlassian, HubSpot, Netflix, and more.

Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- The top Atlassian competitors are GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Jive Software, Asana, Zoho, Wrike and others.\n\n**Microsoft Competitive Threat:**\nMicrosoft represents the most significant competitive threat, leveraging Azure DevOps and GitHub.

Microsoft has a rating of 4.4 stars with 189 reviews.\n\n**ServiceNow Competition:**\nA giant in the IT service management (ITSM) tools sector, ServiceNow competes directly with Jira Service Management. The question of how does ServiceNow compete with Atlassian centers on enterprise-grade ITSM features.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- Strong market position in agile project management\n- Comprehensive ecosystem approach\n- Self-service business model\n- Fending off Microsoft's end-to-end ecosystem advantage, where tools like Azure DevOps and Teams are pre-integrated for existing customers.\n\n## 11.

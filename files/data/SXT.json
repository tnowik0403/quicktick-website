Strong dividend, buybacks ($50M authorized). Growth upside for portfolios: 15-20% total return potential to fair value in 12-18 months (assuming FY24 EPS beat, Q3 guide up). Not a screaming Buy due to near-term softness.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $88** (20% upside; DCF-based at 10% WACC, 4% growth terminal; aligns with 25x fwd P/E on $3.50 2025 EPS).  \n\n*Risks: Earnings miss on destocking (20% prob.); Opportunity: M&A catalyst.*",

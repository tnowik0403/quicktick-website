(BNL) is a U.S.-focused, industrial-oriented diversified net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, owns, and manages single-tenant commercial real estate properties leased primarily under long-term triple-net leases (average remaining lease term ~9.5 years as of Q2 2024). Founded in 2007 and public since 2021 via NYSE listing, BNL emphasizes mission-critical industrial assets (63% of portfolio), with the balance in retail (20%), office (9%), and other sectors. Its ~810-property portfolio spans ~39 million square feet across 45 states and Canada, with 99.5% occupancy and a weighted average tenant credit rating of BBB-/B+ (S&P/Moody's equivalent). Tenants are investment-grade or equivalent (~70%), including blue-chip names like FedEx, JPMorgan Chase, and Dollar General. BNL's strategy centers on value-add acquisitions, portfolio recycling via opportunistic dispositions, and rent escalations (average 1.9% annually). As of Q2 2024, it generated stable cash flows from net leases where tenants cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance, positioning it as a lower-risk income play in the $500B+ U.S. single-tenant net lease market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings** (reported July 30, 2024; verified from Broadstone 10-Q and earnings release):\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 Value | YoY Change |\n  |-------------------------|---------------|------------|\n  | Rental Revenue         | $115.6M      | +3.2%     |\n  | AFFO per Share         | $0.27        | +3.8%     |\n  | Net Income             | $15.3M       | N/A       |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA        | $89.1M       | +4.1%     |\n  | Acquisitions            | $143M (3 properties) | N/A |\n  - Beat consensus AFFO estimates by $0.01; raised FY2024 AFFO guidance to $1.05-$1.07/share.\n- **Q3 2024 Guidance**: Issued October 2024; AFFO expected $0.26-$0.27/share.\n- **Portfolio Activity**: Acquired $265M in assets YTD through Q2; disposed $106M (gain on sale $17M).

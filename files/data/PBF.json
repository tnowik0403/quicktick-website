(NYSE: PBF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, from Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $31.25\n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.68 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $24.13 - $56.11\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 7.45\n- **Dividend Yield**: 5.12% (Quarterly dividend of $0.25/share declared Sep 26, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nPBF Energy Inc. is an independent refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants, and other petroleum products across the United States. Headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, the company operates five high-complexity refineries with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 1 million barrels per day (bpd), representing about 5-6% of total U.S. refining capacity. Key facilities include:\n- Delaware City Refinery (DE): 182,200 bpd, focuses on clean products.\n- Paulsboro Refinery (NJ): 168,000 bpd, East Coast gasoline hub.\n- Toledo Refinery (OH): 170,000 bpd, Midwest gasoline/diesel.\n- Chalmette Refinery (LA): 189,000 bpd, Gulf Coast exports.\n- Martinez Refinery (CA): 120,000 bpd (partially converted to renewables).\n\nPBF's business model emphasizes operational efficiency, cost discipline, and leveraging regional crack spreads (differentials between crude oil and refined products). In 2023, it produced ~950k bpd throughput, selling primarily to wholesalers, retailers, and industrial users via rack sales and exchanges. The company generates revenue through refining margins rather than branded retail, benefiting from volatile energy markets but exposed to commodity cycles. Recent strategic shifts include renewable diesel production at Martinez (up to 10,000 bpd nameplate) to tap low-carbon fuel standards (LCFS) credits in California, alongside logistics assets like terminals and pipelines. PBF employs ~4,400 people and prioritizes shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks, distributing $1.2B+ since 2021.

Renewables provide growth (~10% EPS accretion by 2026), moderate risk via diversified regions/dividends. Cyclical downside if cracks stay <$15/bbl.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $42.00 (35% upside)  \n  DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; $2.5B 2025 EBITDA at 4.5x multiple), for growth-oriented portfolio.

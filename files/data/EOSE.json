The platform is hosted entirely on U.S. infrastructure, with proprietary Eos-developed code and no reliance on foreign software or cloud services.\n\nDawnOS Insights, the AI-enabled system analytics platform launched in beta in April 2025, delivers deep, real-time visibility into energy storage performance with both aggregated metrics and detailed performance data down to the string and battery level. The platform gets smarter every day with AI features like proactive anomaly detection already live and more intelligent tools planned for release in 2025 and 2026.\n\n**Manufacturing Expansion:**\nUnder Project AMAZE, Eos announced the next phase of its growth strategy with U.S. manufacturing expansion and establishment of a new software hub in Pennsylvania to strengthen American energy storage capacity and job creation. The company will establish a software hub at Nova Place, Pittsburgh's premiere technology and innovation center, supporting the growing workforce and proprietary DawnOS platform while deepening partnerships with Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Manufacturing Scale-Up:**\nCombined with increasing throughput on the company's first state-of-the-art manufacturing line, Eos is positioned to ramp production to an annualized rate of 2 GWh per year by year-end 2025 and more than triple its output in the fourth quarter.\n\n**Market Positioning:**\nWith artificial intelligence infrastructure expanding at unprecedented pace, pushing electricity demand beyond traditional grid development timelines, Eos is positioned as a key contributor to America's energy independence amid shifting trade dynamics, tariffs, and export controls.\n\n**Pennsylvania Expansion:**\nIn partnership with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Allegheny County, Eos was awarded a joint $24 million economic development package to advance U.S. manufacturing and job creation, reinforcing the company's transformation as Pennsylvania becomes a national hub for energy, technology, and manufacturing innovation.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Government and Military:**\nThe company secured several key standalone storage orders including contracts with a municipal cooperative in Springfield Missouri, the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, and the Naval Base of San Diego. An $8 million order to supply a BESS for a U.S. Navy base in San Diego was directly influenced by the DoD's prohibition on the use of batteries from prominent Chinese manufacturers.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nEos secured a 228 MWh order from Frontier Power, a leading UK developer, to deploy Z3™ systems across multiple long-duration demonstrations ahead of the UK's Ofgem Cap-and-Floor program.\n\nIn the U.S., Eos signed a 750 MWh supply agreement with MN8 Energy to deliver clean, dispatchable power for large load applications such as data centers.\n\nTalen Energy and Eos signed a strategic collaboration framework to deliver multi-GWh storage capacity across Pennsylvania, pairing long-duration storage with existing generation assets to enhance grid resilience, support AI growth, and strengthen national energy security.\n\n**Data Center Focus:**\nGrowth was driven by strong increase in large-scale projects tied to data center expansion, which now account for approximately 22% of the total pipeline.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nRecord quarterly revenue of $30.5 million, a 100% increase compared to the prior quarter and up 35x from the same period last year, as production efficiencies continue to improve.\n\nGross loss of $33.9 million compared to $31.0 million in the prior quarter, a 92-point margin improvement, driven by increased production volumes and improved project margins.\n\nOperating expenses totaled $27.3 million, $5.6 million lower than prior quarter.\n\n**Guidance and Outlook:**\nFor full-year 2025, Eos provided revenue guidance of $150-$160 million. The company anticipates achieving a positive contribution margin in the fourth quarter and a positive gross margin by Q1 2026.\n\n**Financial Health:**\nThe company's EBITDA is -$209.59M USD, with current EBITDA margin of -1.01K%. Eos completed a November 2025 balance sheet overhaul, adding roughly $474 million net cash and extending debt maturities to 2031.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n**Pipeline and Backlog:**\nDuring Q3, Eos added $3.8 billion to its commercial pipeline, bringing the total to $22.6 billion, representing 91 GWh of energy storage capacity. Orders backlog stood at $644.4 million, representing approximately 2.5 GWh.\n\n**Zinc Battery Market Position:**\nThe global zinc battery market is projected to reach USD 2,728.6 million by 2032 from USD 974.7 million in 2024, at a CAGR of 13.53%. Eos Energy Enterprises leads the charge among potential winners in zinc-based energy storage, with recent stock surge fueled by strategic partnerships, manufacturing scale-up, and growing demand from sectors like AI data centers.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Technology Differentiation:**\nEos's focus on aqueous zinc battery systems for 3- to 12-hour applications offers a compelling alternative to lithium-ion, particularly for grid-scale and industrial uses where cost, safety, and lifespan are paramount.\n\n**Competitive Landscape:**\nEos Energy Storage's top competitors include Energy Dome, GE Vernova, and Energy Vault. Main competitors include Phinergy, TrinaBESS, Amprius, Aquion Energy, ViZn Energy, Primus Power and NantEnergy.\n\n**Market Advantages:**\nThe thesis for Eos is less about beating scaled Chinese lithium-ion on cost today, and more about its unique position within the protected U.S. market as a primary beneficiary of the geopolitical moat. A premium-priced, protected market exists for Eos's product, where domestic manufacturing and a secure supply chain are valued above pure cost-per-kilowatt-hour.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nStrategic partnership with Bimergen Energy aims to accelerate U.S. battery storage projects, leveraging cutting-edge Z3 battery technology.\n\n**Government Support:**\nThe U.S. government is more than just a potential customer; it's an active partner, providing a $303.5 million loan and the opportunity to generate significant income from IRA manufacturing credits.\n\n**Carnegie Mellon Partnership:**\nThe company plans to deepen its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, a leading institution in robotics, AI, computer science, and engineering to further develop a state-of-the-art workforce for its software hub.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Board Leadership Transition (December 2025):**\nRuss Stidolph stepped down from the board effective December 31, 2025, after more than a decade of involvement. The board appointed industry veteran Joseph Nigro, former Exelon CFO and Constellation CEO, as non-executive chair effective January 1, 2026, to support Eos's next phase of operational scaling and market expansion.\n\n**Field Performance:**\nAs of October 28, 2025, the company had three major utilities actively cycling its technology and one Department of Defense site in operation. Performance metrics showed 23.4 MWh of discharged energy with an average discharge duration of 4.6 hours and average round trip efficiency of 84.6%.\n\n**Financial Strengthening:**\nEos Energy successfully closed $600 Million Convertible Senior Notes Offering and Registered Direct Offering of Common Stock, enhancing financial liquidity and fueling U.S. Manufacturing Expansion.\n\n## 12.

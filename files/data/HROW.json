(NASDAQ: HROW) is an eye care pharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and commercializes innovative prescription drugs targeting unmet needs in ophthalmology. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Nashville, TN, Harrow operates through subsidiaries like ImprimisRx (compounding pharmacy), Surface Ophthalmics (R&D), and Harrow Health (commercial). Its portfolio focuses on FDA-approved branded ophthalmics with limited generic competition, addressing conditions like dry eye disease (DED), inflammation/post-op pain, and blepharitis. Harrow's strategy emphasizes \"101/102 Strategy\": acquiring underpromoted FDA-approved drugs (101s), relaunching with targeted sales forces, and developing new formulations (102s). Key revenue drivers include ILEVRO (nepafenac for post-cataract pain/inflammation, ~40% of sales), INVELTYS (loteprednol for post-op inflammation, ~30%), and VEVYE (cyclosporine for DED, launched May 2023). Harrow serves ~12,000 U.S. ophthalmologists/optometrists via a 100+ sales force, with compounding contributing ~20% of revenue. In 2023, revenue hit $136.1M (+53% YoY); Q2 2024 marked $61.9M (+85.6% YoY). The company targets the $35B+ U.S. ophthalmology market, leveraging aging demographics (65M+ Americans over 65 by 2030) and DED prevalence (16M diagnosed, 30M+ undiagnosed).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Net revenue $61.9M (+85.6% YoY); GAAP net loss $(4.4M) or $(0.13)/diluted share; Adjusted EBITDA $6.1M (+$10.2M YoY).

Potential: Retina specialists for TRS-301; international via Mayfield (Italy/Spain).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Mark Baum (ex-Imprimis) strong track record; insider ownership 10%+.\n- **ESG**: Focus on access (compounding affordability); no major issues.\n- **Risks**: Execution on VEVYE/TP-03; FDA scrutiny on compounding (post-503B rules).\n- **Catalysts**: Q3 earnings Nov 2024 (VEVYE $10M+ est.); TP-03 data H1 2025.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside). Rationale: 70%+ 2024 revenue growth, VEVYE inflection (echoing Xiidra's $1B ramp), undervalued at 1.8x 2025 EV/Sales vs. peers 4-6x. Moderate risk from losses/debt offset by $40M cash, improving margins.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $38 (56% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 25% CAGR to 2028, 12x terminal multiple on $500M rev); aligns with analyst cons. PT avg $28 (BofA/Lake St.). Hold if risk-averse; sell below $20. Portfolio fit: High-growth biopharma with derisked 101s.",

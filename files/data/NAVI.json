Headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, Navient services a diverse portfolio including Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, private student loans, and K-12 loans. The company operates through three main segments: Federal Education Loans (servicing legacy federal loans), Consumer Lending (managing owned private education loan portfolios), and Business Processing (providing technology-enabled services like healthcare revenue cycle management via its Xtend Healthcare subsidiary). Navient's core revenue comes from net interest income on its $11-12 billion loan portfolio, servicing fees, and ancillary services. With roots tracing back to Sallie Mae's 2014 spin-off, Navient has evolved amid regulatory shifts, including the 2021 sale of its $8.5 billion consumer lending business to Voya Financial, allowing a sharper focus on high-margin servicing and asset management. As of Q2 2024, Navient services over $300 billion in loans for more than 12 million accounts, emphasizing operational efficiency, technology integration (e.g., AI-driven borrower support), and compliance in a politically sensitive sector. The company targets stable cash flows via its FFELP assets (non-forgivable) and diversification into non-education verticals, positioning it resiliently against federal policy volatility.

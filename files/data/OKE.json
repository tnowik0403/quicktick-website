(NYSE: OKE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Stock Price: $83.12\n- Market Capitalization: $48.19 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $65.70 - $85.43\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nONEOK, Inc. is a leading Fortune 500 midstream energy company headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, specializing in the gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Operating one of the largest integrated NGL systems in the U.S., ONEOK transports approximately 20% of U.S. NGL production with key infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain (Williston Basin), Permian Basin, and Mid-Continent regions. Its natural gas segment includes interstate pipelines like the Guardian Pipeline and gathering systems processing over 3 Bcf/d. The company serves producers, refiners, and petrochemical manufacturers through fee-based contracts, providing stability amid commodity volatility. Post-2023 Magellan Midstream acquisition, ONEOK expanded into refined products pipelines (e.g., Longhorn, Seabrook), enhancing diversification. With 40,000+ miles of pipelines, it generated record volumes in 2024, driven by Permian growth. ONEOK emphasizes long-term contracts (80%+ fee-based), capital discipline, and shareholder returns via dividends (yield ~5%) and buybacks.

Rationale: Superior NGL growth (12% volume CAGR to 2026), 10%+ FCF yield, undervalued vs. peers (DCF-implied 15% upside). Moderate risk via fee-based stability, offset by capex execution.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $98/share (20% upside from $83.12).

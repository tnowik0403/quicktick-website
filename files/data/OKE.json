Magellan Midstream Partners operates as a subsidiary of ONEOK and owns approximately 2,200 miles of crude pipelines, and the 450-mile Longhorn pipeline, which transports roughly 275,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Permian Basin to storage and refining facilities in Houston.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Major Infrastructure Projects\n\nONEOK has entered into joint ventures with MPLX LP to construct a new large-scale 400,000-barrel per day (bpd) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) export terminal in Texas City, Texas. The pipeline joint venture (MBTC Pipeline LLC) is owned 80% by ONEOK and 20% by MPLX, with ONEOK's and MPLX's share of the total investment expected to be approximately $280 million and $70 million, respectively, for a total of $350 million. ONEOK's share of capital investment for these projects is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion. The export terminal joint venture is expected to be completed in early 2028.\n\n### Processing and Pipeline Expansion\n\nIn August 2025, ONEOK announced plans to construct the Bighorn natural gas processing plant, a 300 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) plant in the Permian Basin, expected to be completed in mid-2027. In August 2025, ONEOK entered into a joint venture agreement to construct the Eiger Express Pipeline, a 450-mile natural gas pipeline from the Permian Basin to Katy, Texas.\n\nONEOK is undertaking a $480 million project to increase pipeline capacity from Kansas to Denver.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe growth strategy of ONEOK is centered on strategic acquisitions and infrastructure development. This approach is designed to expand its geographical reach, diversify its service offerings, and capitalize on emerging market opportunities.\n\nONEOK anticipates incremental synergies of $250 million for 2025 from the integration of Magellan, Medallion, and EnLink assets, showcasing the financial benefits of strategic acquisitions. This extraordinary growth has been possible because of employees' focus on excellence, service and innovation, strategic assets and intentional and disciplined approach to organic growth and acquisitions. It has been more than a year since completion of the acquisition of Magellan, and the company continues to identify synergy opportunities related to the transaction exceeding original expectations.\n\nThe \"synergy flywheel\" has allowed the company to guide for a staggering 15% EPS growth and 10% Adjusted EBITDA growth for the 2026 fiscal year—figures that are nearly double the industry average.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nONEOK serves integrated and independent exploration and production companies; other NGL and natural gas gathering and processing companies; crude oil and natural gas production companies; utilities; industrial companies; natural gasoline distributors; propane distributors; municipalities; ethanol producers; petrochemical, refining, and marketing companies; and diluent users, refineries.\n\nPresident and CEO Pierce Norton has engaged with fellow industry leaders, including Baker Hughes' Lorenzo Simonelli, Chevron's Clay Neff and ExxonMobil LNG's Peter Clarke, in discussions on supplying natural gas to the growing global economy. This demonstrates ONEOK's relationships with major energy companies.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Performance\n\nONEOK reported full-year 2024 net income including noncontrolling interests and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) of $3.1 billion and $6.78 billion, respectively.\n\nFor Q3 2025, ONEOK reported net income of $940 million, resulting in $1.49 per diluted share, with Adjusted EBITDA of $2.12 billion (includes $7 million of transaction costs). ONEOK's remarkable performance in 3M is evident with an impressive revenue growth rate of 71.89% as of 30 September, 2025, signifying a substantial increase in the company's top-line earnings.\n\n### Capital Structure\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2025: No borrowings outstanding under ONEOK's $3.5 billion credit agreement or commercial paper program. Approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In October 2025, ONEOK declared a quarterly dividend of $1.03 per share, or $4.12 per share annualized.\n\n### Financial Health\n\nWith a below-average debt-to-equity ratio of 1.53, ONEOK adopts a prudent financial strategy, indicating a balanced approach to debt management. ONEOK's long-term debt was $32 billion as of Sept. 30, 2025 compared with only $12.7 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n\nThe broader significance of the ONEOK rally reflects two of the most powerful economic trends of 2026: the AI data center boom and the \"second wave\" of U.S. LNG exports. Natural gas demand for power generation is currently growing at its fastest rate in a decade, driven by the massive energy requirements of AI hyperscalers.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the landscape in 2026 has become significantly more favorable. The passage of the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act and the PIPES Act of 2025 has streamlined the permitting process for pipeline expansions and provided legal certainty for hydrogen and carbon capture projects. These policy shifts have reduced the \"litigation tail\" that historically delayed projects.\n\n### Headwinds\n\nThe ONEOK growth strategy could be affected by intense competition, particularly in the Permian Basin. Multiple projects are expanding pipeline takeaway capacity, potentially leading to an overbuilt market and reduced profitability in 2025.\n\nRegulatory changes, especially in environmental policies, pose a significant challenge. These changes could impact project timelines and increase operational costs, especially for large capital projects like the LPG export terminal.\n\nThe acquisitions have added employee-related and integration costs, as well as debt. ONEOK's aggressive debt-backed growth made energy investors jittery, and the stock felt the pressure throughout 2025.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nConsolidation has lifted the combined revenue share of the five largest operators to roughly 62%, signaling moderate concentration in the US oil and gas midstream market. ONEOK ranks sixth among major US midstream companies by market cap at $46.82B, behind The Williams Companies ($74.31B), Enterprise Products Partners ($69.63B), Kinder Morgan ($61.65B), Energy Transfer LP ($56.96B), and MPLX LP ($54.88B).\n\nKinder Morgan already ships 40% of the US's LNG feed gas, positioning its network to serve export plants and in-state data centers simultaneously. ONEOK's position in the market is strengthening through strategic acquisitions and integrated operations.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nIn the competitive landscape of early 2026, ONEOK appears to be pulling ahead of its traditional rivals. While Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) remains the \"gold standard\" for conservative income investors with its 27-year track record of distribution increases, its projected 5% earnings growth for 2026 looks modest compared to ONEOK's double-digit targets.\n\nThe Williams Companies (WMB) stands as a formidable competitor, particularly as the \"pure-play\" leader in natural gas for power generation. While Williams has successfully secured long-term contracts with AI data center operators along the Eastern Seaboard, ONEOK's diversified portfolio—which includes refined products and NGLs—provides a broader hedge against regulatory risks.\n\nONEOK's top competitors include: Enterprise Products Partners, Targa Resources, National Fuel Gas, and Pembina Pipeline.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Major Acquisitions\n\nIn September 2023, ONEOK acquired Magellan Midstream Partners for $18.8 billion. Included in the acquisition was the Magellan-owned East Houston terminal and crude oil trading hub, facilities in Galena Park, Texas and Seabrook, Texas, and a terminal in Pasadena, Texas.\n\nONEOK went on an acquisition spree in late 2024, acquiring Medallion Midstream for $2.6 billion and the remaining stake in EnLink Midstream for $4.3 billion in an all-stock deal. In January 2025, ONEOK finalized the acquisition of EnLink Midstream. This strategic move significantly broadened ONEOK's operational footprint, particularly in the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast regions.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\n\n\"We are excited to collaborate with MPLX on these strategically located projects which expand and extend our NGL value chain providing additional optionality and value to our customers,\" said Pierce H. Norton II, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. \"Given our high expectations for future growth and demand for more energy infrastructure, including export capacity, these projects with MPLX complement our disciplined capital allocation strategy.\"\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Performance\n\nONEOK, Inc. reported higher third quarter 2025 earnings with net income of $940 million. The company saw increased NGL volumes and successful acquisition integration, enhancing stakeholder value. The company highlighted a 17% increase in Rocky Mountain region NGL raw feed throughput volumes and a 6% rise in the Mid-Continent region.\n\n### Credit and Financial Developments\n\nNo borrowings outstanding under ONEOK's $2.5 billion credit agreement. In February 2025, ONEOK amended and restated its credit agreement, increasing the capacity to $3.5 billion and extending the expiration to February 2030.\n\n### Analyst Coverage\n\nAnalyst insights reveal a 12-month price target average of $83.0, with a high estimate of $95.00 and a low estimate of $76.00. The current average has experienced a 7.09% decline from the previous average price target of $89.33. The average 12-month price target for ONEOK is $88.52, with 13 analysts recommending buying the stock, while 0 suggest selling, leading to an overall rating of Buy.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: 7.8/10\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis, ONEOK receives a \"Buy\" rating of 7.8 out of 10 for investors seeking strong growth upside with moderate risk appetite.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strong Financial Performance**: 15% EPS growth and 10% Adjusted EBITDA growth guidance for 2026—figures that are nearly double the industry average\n- **Strategic Positioning**: Successfully integrating major acquisitions with $250 million in anticipated synergies for 2025\n- **Market Opportunities**: Well-positioned for AI data center growth and LNG export expansion\n- **Dividend Stability**: 5.62% dividend yield with strong coverage\n- **Regulatory Environment**: Improved regulatory landscape supporting infrastructure development\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- High debt levels from acquisition activity\n- Integration execution risk\n- Competitive pressure in Permian Basin\n- Commodity price sensitivity\n\n### Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $88-$92 per share**\n\nThis valuation is based on:\n- DCF analysis incorporating synergy realizations\n- Peer multiple analysis (EV/EBITDA of 11-12x)\n- Asset-based valuation of pipeline network\n- Growth prospects from infrastructure investments\n\nCurrent analyst consensus supports this range, with stock trading near $73 and analysts increasingly calling for a breakout rally toward the $88–$90 range. This optimism is fueled by the company's successful pivot from a regional natural gas liquids specialist to a diversified midstream powerhouse.\n\nThe stock offers attractive upside potential of 20-25% from current levels, supported by strong fundamentals, strategic positioning, and improving market conditions for midstream operators.",

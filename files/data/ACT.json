(NASDAQ: ACT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 10, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Stock Price**: $41.32  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $6.62 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $24.82 - $42.35  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 10.22  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 1.16% (annualized $0.48/share)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEnact Holdings, Inc. (ACT) is a leading U.S. provider of private mortgage insurance (MI) and related risk management products, primarily serving mortgage lenders, banks, credit unions, and government-sponsored enterprises (GDEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Enact operates through its core subsidiaries: Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation (EMI) for MI underwriting and Enact Mortgage Insurance Enterprise (EMIE) for reinsurance and portfolio management. The company insures conventional, government, and home equity loans, mitigating lender credit risk in the event of borrower default.  \n\nFounded as part of Genworth Financial's MI business, Enact went public via IPO in September 2021 after a spin-off. It focuses on data-driven underwriting using proprietary analytics (e.g., Enact Insights platform) to price risk accurately amid housing market cycles. In 2023, Enact expanded into title insurance via the acquisition of Cedar Equity, positioning it as a vertically integrated housing risk management provider. With ~$6B market cap, Enact holds a strong position in the ~$300B MI sector, benefiting from high homeownership demand and low penetration rates (~45% of new originations insured). Its conservative loss reserving and high persistency rates (loan retention post-refi/prepay) drive profitability. Recent performance reflects housing resilience despite elevated rates, with emphasis on master policy relationships with top lenders.

Avoid buy for pure growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $28.00 (25% upside from $22.39). Based on 10-11x FY2025E EBITDA ($500M) at peer avg discount, DCF (8% WACC, 3% terminal), and 4-5% revenue CAGR. Moderate risk: Execution on digital shift key; suits income-focused with growth tolerance.",

  "tldr_summary": "Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS) is a REIT operating 455 properties with 173,341 sites across manufactured housing communities, RV resorts, and marinas, generating recurring revenue through land-lease models.\n\nELS holds ~35% of the public manufactured housing REIT market, competing against Sun Communities and UMH Properties. The company benefits from demographic tailwinds (aging Baby Boomers), high barriers to entry, and 94%+ occupancy. Management plans 5.1% rent increases in 2026 and targets organic infill growth. However, the company faces litigation risks regarding rent-increase practices, RV demand normalization in northern markets, and climate exposure in Florida-heavy portfolio.\n\nWith a fair value of $72 versus current price of $60.93, the 7.2/10 rating reflects solid defensive characteristics and 18% upside potential, though tempered by execution risks and premium current valuations."

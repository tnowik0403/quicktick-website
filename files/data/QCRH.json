In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(QCRH) is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in Moline, Illinois, primarily operating in the Midwestern United States. It provides a full suite of commercial and retail banking products and services through its three federally chartered community bank subsidiaries: Quad Cities Bank & Trust (QCBT), Rock River Bank & Trust (RRBT), and Cedar Rapids Bank & Trust (CRBT). These banks serve markets in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arizona, focusing on commercial real estate (CRE), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, and retail deposits.\n\nAs of Q2 2024 (earnings released July 24, 2024), QCRH managed $13.4 billion in total assets, $10.4 billion in loans, and $11.1 billion in deposits. The company emphasizes relationship banking, with a loan portfolio heavily weighted toward CRE (53%) and C&I (29%). It differentiates through specialized lending in agribusiness, healthcare, and manufacturing, alongside wealth management via U.S. Bank wealth services partnership.

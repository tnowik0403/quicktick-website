(GILD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Report Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Current Stock Price:** $82.45 (as of market close January 15, 2026, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $102.8 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, January 15, 2026)  \n**52-Week Range:** $70.25 - $92.18  \n**Dividend Yield:** 2.95% (trailing 12 months)  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) is a leading biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Foster City, California, specializing in therapeutics for life-threatening diseases, with a core focus on virology (HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis), oncology, and inflammation. Founded in 1987, Gilead has transformed HIV treatment from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition through blockbuster antiretrovirals like Biktarvy, which dominates the market. The company generates the majority of its revenue from HIV therapies (~65% of total sales), supplemented by COVID-19 antiviral Veklury (remdesivir), oncology assets like Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer), and a growing liver disease portfolio including seladelpar for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Gilead's strategy emphasizes innovation via internal R&D (~$5B annual investment) and strategic acquisitions, such as the $21B Immunomedics deal in 2020 for Trodelvy and recent expansions into cell therapy. With ~18,000 employees, Gilead operates globally, serving millions through partnerships with governments, NGOs, and pharma peers. In 2025, it navigated patent cliffs on older HIV drugs while scaling oncology to offset declining hepatitis C sales, positioning for sustained mid-single-digit revenue growth amid a robust $200B+ antiviral market and expanding $150B oncology sector.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2025 Earnings (Reported October 24, 2025):** Total revenue $7.07 billion (up 6% YoY); HIV franchise $4.55 billion (up 5%); Oncology $393 million (up 32% YoY, driven by Trodelvy); Veklury $241 million (down due to reduced COVID demand).

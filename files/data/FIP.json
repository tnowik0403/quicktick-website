The company focuses on creating sustainable, amenity-rich neighborhoods integrating residential, commercial, educational, and recreational spaces. Its portfolio includes three major projects: Great Park Neighborhoods in Irvine, CA (3,000+ acres, ~19,000 homes planned); Valencia Community in Los Angeles County (~12,000 acres, ~20,000 homes); and Candlestick and San Francisco Shipyard in San Francisco (~800 acres, ~12,000 homes); plus the newer Storyroad project in Dublin, CA (616 acres, ~3,500 homes). FIP emphasizes entitlement, land development, and home sales, generating revenue through land sales to merchants (homebuilders), commercial operators, and asset sales. As of Q2 2024, it owns ~4,000 sellable lots with strong demand from high-income buyers. FIP benefits from California's housing shortage but faces regulatory hurdles. Led by CEO Dan Hedigan since 2020, it went public in 2016 via SPAC.

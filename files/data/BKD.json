(NYSE: BKD) is the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States, providing a continuum of care across independent living (IL), assisted living (AL), memory care (MC), and resorts/luxury communities. As of Q2 2024, Brookdale manages 635 communities with approximately 39,000 units and 42,000 residents across 42 states, generating revenue primarily from resident fees (96% of total). The company emphasizes personalized care, wellness programs, and community-based living for seniors aged 65+, addressing the growing demand from the aging Baby Boomer population (projected U.S. 80+ population to double by 2040 per U.S. Census). \n\nFounded in 1978 and public since 2005, Brookdale operates through four segments: AL Communities (58% of revenue), Retirement Communities (24%), MC/CCRCs (10%), and management services/other (8%). It focuses on same-community occupancy growth (reached 82.4% in Q2 2024, up 290 bps YoY) and RevPAR expansion via rate increases (4.8% YoY in Q2).

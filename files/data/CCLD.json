(CCLD) is a full-stack healthcare enablement platform company headquartered in Somerset, New Jersey, founded in 1999. It primarily serves independent medical groups, health systems, and post-acute care facilities across the U.S. with integrated SaaS solutions for revenue cycle management (RCM), electronic health records (EHR), practice management (PM), patient engagement, and telehealth. The company's cloud-based platform automates administrative burdens, enabling providers to focus on patient care while optimizing financial outcomes.

It targets ambulatory practices in specialties like cardiology, orthopedics, and primary care, with a network of over 60,000 providers (down from peaks due to churn). Recent challenges include client attrition and integration issues from prior M&A, but the company emphasizes AI-driven tools for efficiency.

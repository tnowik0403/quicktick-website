(AXIL) is a technology-driven audio company specializing in performance hearing protection and enhancement products tailored for extreme noise environments, primarily the $10B+ U.S. shooting sports, hunting, and outdoor recreation markets. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, AXIL designs, manufactures, and markets innovative in-ear electronic earbuds, over-ear muffs, and accessories under brands like AXIL GS Extreme 2.0, XCORR, and Trackr Blaze. These products combine active noise cancellation, amplification of low-level sounds (e.g., conversation or wildlife), and protection against high-decibel impulses (up to 140dB+), outperforming traditional passive foam plugs or muffs in comfort and situational awareness. AXIL targets recreational shooters, hunters, law enforcement, military, and industrial workers via direct-to-consumer e-commerce (axil.com), Amazon, big-box retailers (e.g., Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's), and distributors. With a focus on Bluetooth-enabled \"smart\" audio tech, AXIL differentiates through superior impulse suppression (0.5ms response time) and IP67 water/dust resistance. The company reported FY2023 revenue of $25.6M (up 58% YoY) but faces profitability challenges amid inventory buildup and margin pressures.

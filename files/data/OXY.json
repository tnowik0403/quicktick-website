Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Direct Air Capture Technology:**\n1PointFive is building Stratos, the world's largest DAC plant, which is expected to be commercially operational in mid-2025, in Ector County, Texas. STRATOS, the highly anticipated Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility, is on track to launch in 2025. The commissioning process is already underway, with start-up operations expected in Q3 2025 and full ramp-up by year-end.\n\n**Technology Partnerships:**\nIn June 2024, Occidental Petroleum signed a memorandum of understanding with TAE Technologies to explore commercial opportunities for using TAE's nuclear fusion technology to provide clean electricity and heat for Occidental's direct air capture (DAC) projects. DAC is an energy-intensive process that involves removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and the partnership aims to address the energy needs of DAC with low-carbon power solutions.\n\n**South Texas DAC Hub:**\nOccidental has been awarded up to $650 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to build the South Texas DAC hub. The South Texas project, to be located on the storied King Ranch, will be close to industrial facilities and energy infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. Initially, the roughly 165-square-mile site is expected to capture 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, with the potential to store up to 3 billion metric tons of CO2 per year.\n\n**Additional DAC Technology:**\nOccidental Petroleum has purchased Holocene Carbon, a direct air capture (DAC) startup based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The purchase of Holocene and its innovative DAC technology will enable Occidental to combine this solution with the one created by Carbon Engineering, optimizing the DAC processes to increase effectiveness and reduce expenses.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions:**\nIn December, the company acquired a Permian producer, CrownRock, for $12 billion. The acquisition was completed in August 2024. Its reserves replacement rate of 230%—including 623 million boe from CrownRock—highlights a strong foundation for long-term growth.\n\n**Carbon Management Focus:**\nOxy is taking bold steps to innovate for a lower-carbon future. We're forging new pathways to reduce emissions across our oil and gas operations while providing products and services to help others do the same, with the ambition of achieving net zero. Its subsidiary, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, focuses on advancing technologies and business solutions that reduce emissions.\n\n**Portfolio Optimization:**\nOxy is aggressively streamlining its portfolio by divesting non-core assets in West Texas. One major step includes the $818 million sale of Delaware Basin assets to Permian Resources, encompassing 29,500 net acres. In October 2025, Occidental sold its subsidiary, OxyChem, to Berkshire Hathaway—which owns 28% of Occidental's stock—for $9.7 billion. Occidental said it would use $6.5 billion to lower debt.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Direct Air Capture Clients:**\nIn 2024, we signed several foundational CDR agreements with major companies, including the sale of 500,000 metric tons of CDR credits to Microsoft in the largest DAC CDR transaction to date. This change is evidenced by the securing of tangible offtake agreements, most notably a multi-year deal to sell 500,000 metric tons of carbon removal credits to Microsoft and other major corporations.\n\nEarly commercial signals emerged through carbon removal credit offtake agreements with companies like AT&T and TD Bank Group, proving that a tangible product—a verifiable ton of removed CO₂—had buyers.\n\n**Strategic Partners:**\nOccidental and BlackRock formed a joint venture for the continued development of the first commercial scale direct air capture facility. The joint venture is a VIE and Occidental consolidates the VIE as it is the primary beneficiary. BlackRock's investment is accounted for as an NCI.\n\nOxy is partnering with ADNOC's XRG on a $500 million Direct Air Capture (DAC) hub in South Texas targeting 500,000 tCO₂/year.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Financial Results:**\nOccidental (NYSE: OXY) today announced net income attributable to common stockholders of $661 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, and adjusted income attributable to common stockholders of $649 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2025.\n\nOXY generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and $1.5 billion of free cash flow before working capital, despite lower oil prices compared to the previous year.\n\n**Production Performance:**\nTotal production volume was 1,465 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d). The metric surpassed the company's guidance of 1,415-1,455 Mboe/d. The company achieved record production levels in the Permian Basin, contributing 800,000 BOE per day, the highest quarterly production in OXY's history.\n\n**Debt Management:**\nOccidental had long-term debt (net of current portion) of $20.84 billion as of Sept. 30, 2025, compared with $24.97 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024. The company retired $8.1 billion in debt in the last 18 months, which lowered annual interest expenses by $440 million.\n\n**2024 Annual Performance:**\nThrough record oil and gas production, optimized transportation and sales from our energy marketing teams and OxyChem's strong margins, we earned $4.9 billion in free cash flow before working capital1, paid approximately $800 million of common dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by more than 22 percent in 2024.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **Warren Buffett's Support:** Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 265 million shares of Occidental Petroleum worth a total of $11 billion -- about 26.9% of the energy company. That makes it Berkshire's seventh-biggest stock holding.\n- **Cost Leadership:** It is well established as a low-cost leader in the fossil fuel space, typically able to break even when crude oil prices are less than $60 per barrel. Indeed, for some of its fields, its breakeven point is under $50 per barrel, while nearly half of its wells are capable of breaking even when oil prices are under $40 per barrel.\n- **AI Data Center Market:** The announcement that an Oxy-developed gas plant will provide behind-the-meter power for the massive 2 GW \"Horizon\" AI data center in Texas demonstrates a direct, symbiotic link between Oxy's traditional energy assets and the AI boom. This is no longer just about selling offset credits; it's about providing an integrated energy and decarbonization solution.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Production Plateau Concerns:** CEO Vicki Hollub has been vocal about the coming production plateau for U.S. oil, possibly as early as 2027.\n- **DAC Technology Challenges:** \"It's a bit of a myth out there that direct air capture is going to be bankable,\" 1PointFive President and General Manager Anthony Cottone, said at BloombergNEF's Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI Summit in Houston Thursday. Lenders want to see long-term revenue, while customers in the voluntary carbon market are not always willing to commit to longer contracts, Cottone said.\n- **Energy Transition Risks:** The company faces challenges from increasing renewable energy adoption and potential commodity price volatility.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**U.S. Oil Production:** We are one of the largest oil and gas producers in the U.S., including a leading producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and offshore Gulf of Mexico. Occidental Petroleum's revenue is supported by strong oil and gas production, chemical operations, and enhanced oil recovery projects.\n\n**International Operations:** The company is the largest independent oil producer in Oman. In Qatar, the company is the second-largest oil producer offshore and is a partial owner in the Dolphin Gas Project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n**Permian Basin Position:** After the CrownRock acquisition, We now would have 60% Delaware Basin and 40% Midland Basin, balancing this Tier 1 inventory.\n\n## 10.

(NASDAQ: IAC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $51.23 (closing price on October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.32 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $41.42 - $59.18  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3 months):** 583,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nIAC Inc. is a leading internet and media holding company that develops, owns, and operates a diverse portfolio of digital marketplaces, media properties, and emerging online services. Founded in 1995 by Barry Diller and headquartered in New York City, IAC has evolved from a pure conglomerate—having spun off Match Group (2020), Vimeo (2021), and Turo (2024)—into a focused operator of high-potential digital assets. Its core segments include **Angi Inc.** (home services marketplace connecting homeowners with pros), **Dotdash Meredith** (premium digital media with 200+ brands like People, Better Homes & Gardens, and Investopedia, reaching 200M+ monthly uniques), **Emerging and Other** (staffing via Bluecrew, caregiving via Care.com, and apps like Mosaic Group), and residual **Search** businesses (Ask.com).  \n\nIn 2023, IAC generated ~$4.6B in revenue, emphasizing profitability amid macro headwinds. The company leverages proprietary tech stacks, AI-driven personalization, and data analytics to drive user engagement and monetization. Post-2024 Turo spin-off (completed April 16, 2024), IAC holds ~82% economic interest in Turo (not consolidated). Strategy centers on operational efficiency, selective M&A, and scaling high-margin verticals like staffing and media. With 10,000+ employees, IAC targets underserved markets in services, content, and labor, positioning for digital economy tailwinds while navigating ad cyclicality and housing softness.

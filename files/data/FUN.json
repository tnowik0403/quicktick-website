In 2023, it hosted ~26 million visitors, focusing on thrill rides (over 200 coasters and attractions), family entertainment, and seasonal events like Halloween Haunt. The company employs a partnership structure (master limited partnership until recent shifts) and emphasizes free cash flow generation for distributions and reinvestment.

Upside from synergies, but moderate risk from close delays/recession.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $55 (30% upside; DCF-based on 3% attendance CAGR, 5% per capita, $400M+ EBITDA post-merger by 2026; 9-10x multiple). Suitable for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% IRR over 2 years.  \n\n*Sources: Q2 Earnings (ir.cedarfair.com, Aug 1, 2024); Merger Filings (SEC EDGAR); TEA/AECOM Report (July 2024); Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (real-time prices); Seeking Alpha/Investor Relations transcripts; Statista/IBISWorld sector data.*",

(PB) is a Houston, Texas-based financial holding company operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prosperity Bank, one of the largest regional banks in Texas. Founded in 1983, it serves retail and commercial customers across Texas and southern Oklahoma with over 260 full-service banking locations spanning major markets like Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, and San Antonio. Core offerings include deposit products (checking, savings, CDs), lending (commercial real estate ~45% of portfolio, commercial & industrial ~30%, consumer ~10%), treasury management, online/mobile banking, and wealth management via Prosperity Wealth Management. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $38.5 billion, with a focus on relationship banking in high-growth Texas markets benefiting from population influx and economic diversification (energy, tech, manufacturing).

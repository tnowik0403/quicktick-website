The company extracts glauconite ore to produce K Forte®, a multinutrient fertilizer containing 10% K₂O (potash), plus silica, iron, magnesium, and micronutrients like zinc and boron. Unlike conventional potash (KCl), K Forte® is a low-chlorine, eco-friendly alternative tailored for Brazil's tropical soils, enhancing crop yields for sugarcane, soybeans, coffee, and cotton while reducing environmental impact (e.g., no saline runoff). \n\nFounded in 2007 and public since 2011, Verde emphasizes ESG principles, with certifications like ISO 14001 for environmental management. Production began in 2022, ramping from 150,000 tpy to target 2.4 million tpy across four plants. In 2024, Verde sold ~30,000 tonnes in H1, capitalizing on Brazil's potash import reliance (95% of ~10 million tonnes annual demand). Revenue growth stems from volume expansion and premium pricing for sustainable credentials amid global food security pushes. Risks include commodity cycles and execution on scaling.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 20, 2024, verified via company PR and SEDAR)**:\n  | Metric              | Q2 2024     | YoY Change |\n  |---------------------|-------------|------------|\n  | Revenue             | BRL 38.1M  | +114%     |\n  | Sales Volume        | 15,500 t   | +82%      |\n  | Gross Profit        | BRL 17.5M  | +188%     |\n  | Gross Margin        | 46%        | +352 bps  |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA     | BRL 12.8M  | +243%     |\n  - H1 2024 total sales: 30,000 tonnes (+150% YoY).\n- **Production Milestones**: September 10, 2024 – Achieved 100,000 tonnes cumulative production since 2022 (company announcement).

It specializes in commercial banking services tailored to the immigrant Chinese and broader Asian-American communities, while also serving small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and individuals across the U.S. The bank offers a full suite of deposit products (checking, savings, time deposits), lending (commercial real estate [CRE], commercial & industrial [C&I], single-family residential mortgages, multifamily), wealth management, and international banking services including trade finance and remittances. With approximately 60 branches concentrated in California (Southern CA focus), New York, Texas, Illinois, Washington, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, Cathay derives ~70% of loans from CRE but maintains strong asset quality. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $24.1B, with deposits at $21.5B and loans at $20.6B. CATY emphasizes relationship banking in niche ethnic markets, benefiting from high deposit stickiness (low-cost core deposits ~80%) and cross-border expertise. It has evolved from a community bank to a regional player with $88.3M net income in Q2 2024 (EPS $1.27, up 6% YoY), driven by net interest margin (NIM) expansion to 3.44%. Recent digital investments and selective lending support resilience amid banking sector volatility.

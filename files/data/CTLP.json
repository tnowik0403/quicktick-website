(CTLP) is a leading provider of digital payments and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for the unattended retail and on-location services markets, including vending machines, laundromats, car washes, amusement devices, and foodservice equipment. The company enables operators to accept cashless payments, monitor telemetry data, and optimize routes through its end-to-end platform. Headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, Cantaloupe serves over 32,000 customers across North America, processing more than $10 billion in gross volume annually via its network of connected devices.\n\nFounded in 1975 (originally USA Technologies), it rebranded to Cantaloupe in 2021 following a merger. The core Seed platform integrates hardware (e.g., card readers, QR codes) with cloud-based analytics for inventory management, remote monitoring, and consumer engagement via the Cantaloupe GO mobile app. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), CTLP generated revenue primarily from transaction fees (70%+), SaaS subscriptions, and hardware sales. The company is pivoting toward recurring revenue streams amid a shift to cashless payments in a $50B+ U.S. unattended retail market, positioning itself as a one-stop digital transformation enabler for \"brick-and-mortar\" SMBs fragmented by legacy cash reliance.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported October 9, 2024)**: Revenue $58.6 million (up 7% YoY), transaction volume $2.0 billion (up 11% YoY), net loss $1.8 million (vs. $0.6 million profit prior year), adjusted EBITDA $7.8 million (up 15% YoY), gross margin 35.4%.

Transaction momentum and undervaluation (EV/EBITDA 8x vs. peers 12x) support 30-50% upside in 12-18 months for moderate-risk growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $10.50 (based on 12x FY2026E EBITDA of $45M, 15% discount to peers for execution risk).

Founded in 2006 through the acquisition of a former Victrex facility, the company operates a single-site campus spanning 600 acres with multi-product capabilities, including a biofuels unit operational since 2009. Its chemicals segment (62% of 2023 revenues) focuses on custom and specialty chemicals for consumer products, industrial applications, and agricultural intermediates, serving markets like cosmetics, lubricants, and crop protection. The biofuels segment (38% of 2023 revenues) produces biodiesel and its co-products (e.g., glycerin), leveraging renewable feedstocks amid growing U.S. demand for low-carbon fuels. FutureFuel emphasizes sustainability, with proprietary technologies for bio-based alternatives to petroleum-derived chemicals. The company benefits from vertical integration, low-cost production, and a lean structure, generating strong cash flows that support a progressive dividend policy (increased 20% in Q2 2024). As of Q2 2024, it employed ~640 people and reported $95.8 million TTM revenues. FutureFuel positions itself as a niche player in the $500B+ global specialty chemicals market and the $40B U.S. biodiesel market, with resilience from diversified end-markets and biofuel tax credits.

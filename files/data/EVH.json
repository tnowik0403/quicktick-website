(NYSE: EVH) is a technology-driven healthcare services company focused on enabling payers, providers, and pharma partners to deliver value-based care. Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Evolent leverages its scalable platforms to manage high-cost chronic conditions, optimize pharmacy benefits, and provide advanced analytics. The company serves over 60 million covered lives across commercial, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid populations, emphasizing whole-person care in oncology, cardiology, musculoskeletal (MSK), and sleep medicine. Its core technology stack includes AI-powered clinical decision support, claims processing, and population health management tools. Evolent's model shifts reimbursement from fee-for-service to shared savings and risk-based contracts, driving better outcomes and cost reductions. Recent strategic acquisitions like Nuna (January 2024) have bolstered its cloud-based data platform, processing petabytes of multimodal healthcare data.

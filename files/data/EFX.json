(NYSE: EFX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 25, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $285.63 (as of market close October 25, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $35.42 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 25, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $203.46 - $308.99  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEquifax Inc. (EFX) is one of the \"Big Three\" consumer credit reporting agencies in the U.S., alongside Experian and TransUnion, providing critical data analytics, credit information, and identity verification services to businesses, governments, and consumers worldwide. Founded in 1899 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Equifax operates through three main segments: **Workforce Solutions** (formerly Employment & Income Services, ~49% of 2023 revenue), which verifies income, employment, and education via The Work Number database covering 75% of U.S. workforce; **U.S. Information Solutions (UIS)** (~39% of revenue), delivering credit reports, scores, and fraud prevention tools like EFX Clarity and Lock & Alert; and **International** (~12% of revenue), serving markets in Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada with localized credit bureaus.\n\nWith a focus on cloud-native platforms post its multi-year cloud migration (completed Q1 2024), Equifax leverages AI, machine learning, and big data to power decisions in lending, hiring, and risk management. In 2023, it processed 1.4 billion consumer credit files and served 10,000+ clients across 24 countries. The company has evolved from traditional credit reporting to a broader ecosystem of verification, analytics, and SaaS solutions amid rising demand for real-time identity and income insights in a gig economy and digital lending era. Recent investments in AI-driven products position it for growth, though legacy issues like the 2017 data breach continue to shape regulatory scrutiny.

Its flagship Thumzup mobile app enables users to discover, review, and promote local merchants by snapping photos of products, meals, services, or events at physical locations, posting them to social media (primarily Facebook and Instagram), and earning cash-back rewards paid via PayPal or direct deposit. Merchants pay for ad placements and user promotions, creating a performance-based model where TZUP earns revenue through merchant subscriptions, pay-per-post fees, and upsells like boosted visibility.\n\nFounded in 2018 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, TZUP targets \"Main Street\" businesses (e.g., restaurants, retail, services) underserved by big tech advertising. The platform emphasizes user-generated content (UGC) to drive authentic engagement, with over 40,000 app downloads and 1,500+ active merchants as of Q2 2024. TZUP uplisted from OTCQB to Nasdaq Capital Market on February 22, 2024, to enhance visibility and access capital markets. Revenue remains nascent but growing, with a freemium model for users and tiered merchant plans ($99-$499/month). Challenges include scaling user acquisition amid competition from established review platforms.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 14, 2024)**: Revenue $117,428 (64% YoY growth from $71,639 in Q2 2023); Gross profit $106,248 (91% gross margin); Net loss $1.1 million (improved from $1.4M YoY, due to lower operating expenses).

Explored acquisitions of micro-SaaS tools (CEO call, May 2024).\n- **Current Clients**: 1,500 SMBs (e.g., local restaurants like Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, CA auto shops); top 10 contribute 30% revenue.\n- **Potential Major Clients**: Regional chains (e.g., approached Sweetgreen, Habit Burger per investor deck Sept 2024); enterprise push via white-label.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Robert Steele (ex-ad tech); strong vision but execution unproven.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (social media ad compliance); competition; 12-month cash runway.\n- **ESG**: Positive UGC authenticity; no formal reporting.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish short-term (uplisting momentum); Reddit/Stocktwits avg. rating 7/10, but volume signals volatility.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **3/10 (Strong Sell)**  \n  Rationale: Explosive upside post-uplisting faded; revenue growth promising (64% YoY) but dwarfed by $1.1M losses, dilution, and penny-stock risks. Fundamentals scream overvaluation at 70x TTM sales vs. peers at 5-10x. Moderate risk appetite unfit for high-beta microcap.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $2.50/share (50% downside)  \n  DCF-based (15% discount rate, 50% 2025 revenue growth to $500K, then 30%; terminal 8x sales multiple). Growth upside limited without profitability inflection (not before 2026). Hold only for speculative traders; sell to reallocate.",

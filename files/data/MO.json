(MO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $53.62\n- **Market Capitalization**: $92.37 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $40.65 - $54.92\n- **Dividend Yield**: 7.98% (quarterly dividend of $1.02/share declared September 25, 2024, payable October 10, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world's largest tobacco companies, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, with a primary focus on the U.S. market. It dominates the American cigarette segment through its Philip Morris USA subsidiary, where Marlboro holds the top position. Altria also leads in smokeless tobacco via U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (Copenhagen and Skoal brands) and is aggressively expanding into smoke-free products, including oral nicotine pouches (on! brand) and e-vapor (NJOY). The company generates revenue primarily from cigarette shipments (historically ~80-90% of total), pricing power, and excise taxes passed to consumers. Beyond tobacco, Altria holds a ~10% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI), a global leader in beer, providing diversified equity income. Recent strategic shifts emphasize \"smoke-free future\" initiatives amid declining cigarette volumes due to health regulations and shifting consumer preferences. Altria reported Q2 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.34 (up 5.2% YoY) and revenues of $6.45 billion (verified from August 1, 2024 earnings release). With a 55-year streak of dividend increases, Altria appeals to income investors, but growth hinges on nicotine pouch and e-vapor acceleration.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024)**: Adjusted EPS $1.34 (+5.2% YoY); revenues $6.45B (-1.9% YoY); cigarette shipment volume down 13.6% to 19.0B units; on! pouch shipment volume +41% to 118.5M cans; NJOY volumes +26%.\n- **Dividend Increase (September 25, 2024)**: 55th consecutive annual hike to $4.08 annualized ($1.02/quarter).\n- **NJOY FDA Authorization Expansion (September 5, 2024)**: FDA authorized four additional NJOY ACE pod flavors, boosting e-vapor portfolio.\n- **on!

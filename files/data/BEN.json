(NYSE: BEN), operating as Franklin Templeton, is a San Mateo, California-based global investment management firm founded in 1947. It provides a wide array of investment products and solutions across equities, fixed income, alternatives, multi-asset strategies, and retirement services to retail, institutional, and high-net-worth clients worldwide.

Key brands include Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series, Fiduciary Trust, and Western Asset Management. Franklin Templeton serves over 115 million client accounts across 155 countries, with a strong emphasis on long-term value investing, income generation, and ESG integration.

Strong growth potential in ETFs/alts for portfolio upside.",

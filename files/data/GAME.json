(GAME) is a digital media and entertainment company specializing in esports, gaming, and youth culture marketing. Headquartered in Frisco, Texas, it operates as an integrated platform connecting brands with Gen Z and millennial audiences through influencer management, content creation, experiential events, and data-driven advertising. The company owns and operates key assets like the GameSquare esports platform, Zoned platform for influencer tech, the Roster Sports & Entertainment agency (managing 1,000+ influencers), and now FaZe Clan (acquired October 1, 2024), a leading esports organization with 600M+ social followers.  \n\nGameSquare generates revenue via four segments: (1) advertising and sponsorships, (2) talent management, (3) content production, and (4) technology licensing. It targets the $1.4B global esports advertising market (Newzoo 2024 estimate), leveraging proprietary tech for performance-based campaigns. Post-FaZe acquisition, GameSquare positions itself as a scaled creator economy player, emphasizing owned IP, direct-to-consumer merch, and brand partnerships.

Formed by the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz (valued at $100 billion at the time, backed by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital), KHC generates the majority of its revenue (~80%) from North America, with the remainder from international markets including Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company operates through two main segments: North America and International, producing consumer staples like Heinz Ketchup (world's #1 ketchup brand), Kraft Mac & Cheese (#1 in U.S. boxed mac & cheese), Oscar Mayer deli meats, Philadelphia cream cheese, Maxwell House coffee, and Planters nuts. KHC emphasizes affordable, convenient foods amid inflationary pressures, leveraging a vast distribution network across retail (supermarkets, club stores like Costco, Walmart), foodservice, and e-commerce. With ~17,000 employees and 2025 projected net sales of ~$25.8 billion, KHC focuses on cost discipline via its \"zero-based budgeting\" model, supply chain efficiencies, and portfolio optimization (e.g., divestitures like Planters to Hormel in 2022). Despite historical challenges like goodwill impairments ($15.4B in 2019), recent strategies prioritize volume growth, innovation in healthier/snackable products, and sustainability (e.g., regenerative agriculture goals by 2030). Trading at a forward P/E of ~11x (below sector avg 18x), KHC offers a 4.7% dividend yield, appealing to income investors, though organic growth lags peers at ~1-2% annually.

Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, the company operates through four main segments: Polyurethanes (MDI-based foams and systems, ~55% of revenues), Performance Products (amines, maleic anhydride, ~20%), Advanced Materials (epoxies, composites, ~15%), and Pigments & Additives (TiO2, ~10%). With ~6,200 employees and 69 manufacturing facilities across 24 countries, Huntsman generated $6.49 billion in trailing 12-month revenues as of Q2 2024. The company focuses on high-value, performance-driven chemistries amid cyclical commodity pressures, leveraging innovation in sustainable products like bio-based polyols and low-VOC coatings. Recent strategic shifts emphasize cost discipline, portfolio optimization, and growth in high-margin specialties, positioning it for recovery in a post-pandemic chemical cycle slowdown.

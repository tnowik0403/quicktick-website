Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, Mosaic operates through three main segments: Phosphates (concentrated phosphates like monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP)), Potash (muriate of potash or MOP), and Mosaic Fertilizantes (crop nutrition products and services in Brazil, including blended fertilizers and micros). \n\nWith production facilities primarily in North America (Florida, Louisiana, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick) and Brazil, Mosaic mines phosphate rock and processes it into fertilizers, while its potash operations leverage low-cost Canadian assets. The company serves farmers, distributors, and industrial customers across 40+ countries, emphasizing sustainable agriculture through nutrient efficiency and reduced environmental impact. In 2023, Mosaic generated ~$13.7B in revenue (per 2023 10-K), benefiting from its vertically integrated model from mining to distribution. Recent challenges include volatile fertilizer prices post-Ukraine war peak, but long-term drivers like rising global population (projected 10B by 2050) and arable land constraints position Mosaic for recovery. The firm also invests in low-carbon ammonia and digital farming tools.

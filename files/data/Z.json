Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Legal Storm**: Zillow's legal challenges began ramping up in mid-June of this year when Compass filed its antitrust lawsuit against the company over its listing access standards policy. Since then another seven lawsuits have been filed with claims ranging from Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) violations, to copyright infringement, and job discrimination.\n\n- **FTC Litigation**: The FTC claims the arrangement—framed publicly as a \"partnership\"—was in fact an unlawful anticompetitive agreement that eliminated Redfin as a meaningful competitor in the online rental space.\n\n- **Google Competition**: Google is testing homes for-sale ads at the top of search results, edging into Zillow's turf.\n\n- **Housing Market Volatility**: Broader housing market headwinds, including affordability issues and elevated mortgage rates, are impacting transaction volumes.\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **AI Market Growth**: The AI in real estate market projected for substantial growth from $222.65 billion in 2024 to $303.06 billion in 2025, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.1%.\n\n- **Market Leadership Position**: Zillow's strong brand and audience, coupled with ongoing innovation, position it for resilience.

Market Shares\n\nZillow has market share of 43.39% in real-estate-listing-management market. The top three of Zillow's competitors in the Real Estate Listing Management category are LoopNet with 21.89%, Diverse solutions with 13.58%, Realtor.com with 10.73% market share.\n\nOverall Real Estate Portal Visits: Zillow Group remains the most visited real estate app and website in the U.S., accounting for over 50% of all real estate portal visits, more than double its closest competitor. Over 50% of all real estate portal visits in the U.S. go to Zillow—more than double the next competitor. Market share: Over 50% of all real estate portal visits, dwarfing the competition.\n\n### Segment-Specific Market Share\nResidential revenue grew 7% year-over-year in Q3 2025 to $435 million. The Premier Agent program is a significant revenue driver, with the Flex program (performance-based) accounting for about 25% of Premier Agent revenue. Rentals: A significant growth engine, with revenue up 41% year-over-year in Q3 2025 to $174 million, driven by multifamily revenue.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors\nRealtor.com is one of the biggest real estate listing sites and Zillow competitors. Although it pulls data from the MLS just like Zillow, it has a reputation for better accuracy and updating listings more quickly. Redfin is both a home search site and a real estate company with its own buying and listing agents. Instead of asking friends for referrals, you can hire a Redfin agent to help you buy or sell a home directly through the platform. It's best for buyers and sellers who want lower commission fees and an easy online process.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nThe most significant difference between Zillow and professional alternatives lies in data sources and accuracy. Zillow's Zestimate algorithm, while popular with consumers, often provides inaccurate home values—especially in rapidly changing markets or areas with unique property characteristics.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\nZillow Group's most recent acquisition is Virtual Staging AI, a AI-powered virtual staging app offering interiors and furnishings for real estate professionals, acquired in October 2024. Zillow Group has made 10 acquisitions across sectors such as Real Estate IT, E-Commerce Enablers, Sales Force Automation and others. Virtual Staging AI, Follow Up Boss and Spruce are its latest acquisitions.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships\nClarification was provided that the Redfin partnership did not involve a transfer of contracts but rather a syndication of listings. Zillow had to actively win this business, which demonstrates the strength of its value proposition.\n\n### Brokerage Partnerships\nZillow today announced a major milestone in the expansion of its flagship listing marketing experience, Zillow Showcase℠: more than 50 agreements signed with brokerages and franchisors since the product launched in 2023.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Q3 2025 Earnings (October 30, 2025)\nZillow delivered Q3 revenue of $676M, up 16% YoY, exceeding the high end of guidance. EBITDA rose to $165M with 24% margin, expanding over 200bps YoY. Rentals revenue surged 41%, while for-sale outperformed the market with 10% growth.\n\n### Product Launches\n- **Zillow Pro announced** (October 15, 2025): Zillow Pro is set to launch nationally next year. Zillow will open an early-access interest list for agents attending its annual Unlock conference in Las Vegas November 3-5. Initial market launches begin in early 2026, with nationwide availability targeted for mid-year.\n\n- **Virtual Staging Launch** (September 10, 2025): Virtual Staging is the first major integration of technology from Virtual Staging AI (VSAI), first introduced through Zillow's October 2024 acquisition of that company.\n\n### Legal Developments\nOn the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday, U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga granted a motion to consolidate the lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission with a related case from attorneys general in Arizona, Connecticut, New York, Virginia and Washington state. The FTC filed a lawsuit against Zillow and Redfin on Sept. 30 in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging the two companies conspired to eliminate competition in the rental listings market in violation of federal antitrust laws.\n\n## 13.

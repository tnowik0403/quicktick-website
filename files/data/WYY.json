Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, the company delivers its services through the ORION Identity and Access Management platform, which supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), zero-trust architecture, and mobile device management (MDM). WidePoint primarily serves U.S. federal agencies (e.g., DoD, DHS, GSA) via contracts under vehicles like GSA IT Schedule 70 and OASIS+. Its solutions ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., NIST, FISMA) for digital identities, IoT devices, and enterprise mobility. In FY2023, ~85% of revenue came from government contracts, with growing commercial penetration. The firm differentiates via its carrier-agnostic approach, integrating with major telcos for secure voice/data. Recent profitability turnaround (net income positive in Q2 2024) stems from cost controls and contract wins amid rising cyber threats and federal zero-trust mandates. With a $195.6M FY2023 revenue base, WidePoint targets expansion in AI-enhanced identity and international markets, positioning as a niche leader in federally compliant cybersecurity.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (ended June 30, 2024):\n  | Metric          | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n  |-----------------|---------|---------|------------|\n  | Revenue        | $28.0M | $25.0M | +12%      |\n  | Gross Profit   | $7.8M  | $6.5M  | +20%      |\n  | Gross Margin   | 28%    | 26%    | +2 pts    |\n  | Net Income     | $1.2M  | ($0.5M)| N/A       |\n  | EPS            | $0.10  | ($0.04)| N/A       |\n  - Backlog grew to $450M+; management highlighted DCAA compliance improvements driving margins.\n- **September 18, 2024**: Selected for $900M OASIS+ Small Business (SB) contract vehicle by GSA, enabling pursuit of task orders in IT services, cybersecurity, and engineering.\n- **October 1, 2024**: Announced $37.5M sole-source contract extension with U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for MDM and cybersecurity services (5-year base + options).\n- **July 23, 2024**: Won $11.7M task order under GSA's EIS contract for identity management for federal civilian agencies.\n- Online discussions (StockTwits, Seeking Alpha, Reddit r/WYY): Bullish on contract pipeline; volatility tied to small-cap status and gov't award delays.

Open to bolt-ons in AI cyber (mgmt. comments Q2 call).\n- **Major Clients**: DoD (Air Force, Navy - 40% rev), DHS, GSA, USPS. **Potential**: CISA (zero-trust RFPs), NATO allies via OASIS+.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong gov't compliance scores; no major incidents.\n- **Management**: CEO Robert Hensley (30+ yrs fed IT); aligned via ownership (5%).\n- **Risks**: Contract concentration (top 3 clients 50% rev); bid/protest exposure.\n- **Sentiment**: Seeking Alpha \"Buy\" consensus; short interest <5%.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside). Recent contracts signal backlog acceleration; undervalued at 0.4x sales vs. sector 4x+. Moderate risk via gov't revenue stability offsets small-cap volatility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $7.50 (75% upside). DCF-based (15% growth 3yrs, 12% WACC, 28% terminal margin); implies $220M 2025 rev at 0.8x sales multiple. Hold for contract catalysts; target timeline 12-18 months.",

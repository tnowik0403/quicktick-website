Moderate risk from energy cyclicality offset by fortress balance sheet.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $72 (18% upside). DCF model (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth) using Q3 fundamentals + 5% revenue CAGR; aligns with analyst targets (DA Davidson $68, Oct 2024 note). Suitable for growth portfolios with regional bank exposure. Hold below $55, add on dips.",

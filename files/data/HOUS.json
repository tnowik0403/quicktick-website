(HOUS) is a leading provider of U.S. residential real estate franchising, brokerage, relocation, and title services. Headquartered in Madison, NJ, the company operates through two primary segments: Anywhere Advisors (82% of Q2 2024 revenue) and Anywhere Integrated Services (18%). Anywhere Advisors franchises iconic brands including Coldwell Banker, Century 21, ERA Real Estate, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, and Corcoran Group, supporting over 25,000 franchisees and agents across 1,200+ offices generating ~$150 billion in annual sales volume (FY 2023 data). Anywhere Integrated Services includes Cartus (corporate relocation for 4,000+ clients), TRREB (appraisals), and title/settlement services via Anywhere Settlement Services. The company owned ~560 company-owned/controlled brokerages (e.g., Coldwell Banker Realty) as of Q2 2024, handling 3-4% of U.S. transaction sides. Formed via 2021 Apollo acquisition and 2022 rebrand from Realogy, Anywhere leverages a tech-enabled platform (e.g., RealVitalize home improvement) amid a consolidating industry.

Strategic review offers event-driven upside but high execution risk. Avoid for growth portfolios; suitable for speculative hold if sale materializes.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $6.50/share** (Moderate growth upside scenario: 35% from current, assumes 2025 recovery +0.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on $120M EBITDA; DCF-based, 10% discount rate, per analyst comps).

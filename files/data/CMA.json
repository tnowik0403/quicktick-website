(CMA) is a U.S.-based specialized distributor of water, wastewater, storm drainage, and fire protection infrastructure products and services. Founded in 2014 through private equity carve-outs and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, the company operates over 350 locations across 50 states, serving municipal governments, private utilities, contractors, and residential developers. Its core segments include Pipe & Products (60%+ of revenue: PVC/ductile iron pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings) and Infrastructure Maintenance Services (valve maintenance, meter reading). CMA focuses on the $100B+ U.S. waterworks market, driven by aging infrastructure and regulatory mandates. The company sources from 10,000+ suppliers and delivers just-in-time to 50,000+ customers, emphasizing value-added services like project management, training, and fusion fabrication. Post-2021 IPO (via STAG Industrial SPAC merger), CMA has grown via 20+ tuck-in acquisitions, achieving scale with $6.7B FY2024 revenue. It benefits from fragmented competition and secular tailwinds like the $1T+ IIJA funding, but faces cyclical exposure to non-residential construction (housing starts down 5% YoY).

Avoid if rates spike further.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $58 (20% upside from $48.52). DCF-based (8% growth 5-yr taper to 4%, 9% WACC, 2% terminal; peers 18x FY2026 EBITDA); aligns with consensus PT range $52-62 (FactSet). Growth portfolio fit: High conviction on infra spend.",

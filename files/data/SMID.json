These products emphasize durability, cost-efficiency, and quick installation, addressing key demands in highway construction, airport runways, military bases, and commercial buildings.\n\nSMID operates seven manufacturing facilities in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, serving state DOTs, general contractors, and private developers. With a focus on infrastructure megatrends driven by the $1.2 trillion IIJA (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 2021), SMID has grown revenues through capacity expansions and contract wins. Recent fiscal performance highlights operational leverage: Q2 2024 revenues reached $28.1 million (up 55% YoY), gross margins expanded to 25.4%, and net income hit $3.2 million (Seeking Alpha transcript, August 14, 2024 earnings call). The company employs ~300 people and maintains a debt-free balance sheet with $15.4 million in cash (Q2 2024 10-Q, filed August 14, 2024). SMID's niche in precast tech positions it for sustained growth amid rising U.S. infrastructure spending, though cyclical construction exposure poses risks.

(NASDAQ: NATH), founded in 1916 on Coney Island, New York, is a leading franchisor, licensor, and processor of branded fast-food products, best known for its iconic all-beef hot dogs. The company operates through three primary segments: (1) **Branded Product Program**, which generates the majority of revenue (~75-80%) via licensed sales of hot dogs, frankfurters, and related products (e.g., buns, fries, onion rings) to supermarkets, grocery stores, club stores, and foodservice distributors under the Nathan's Famous and Arthur Treacher's brands; (2) **Restaurant Franchising**, overseeing ~560 franchised units (primarily beef franks-focused quick-service restaurants) in 37 U.S. states and 10 international markets as of Q2 FY2024; and (3) **Corporate-Owned Restaurants**, a smaller segment with ~10 company-owned units. Nathan's leverages its brand heritage through royalties, licensing fees, and product sales, with minimal capital-intensive operations due to its asset-light franchise model. The company also hosts the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest (July 4th, 2024 winner: Patrick Bertoletti). In FY2023, total revenue reached $97.0 million (flat YoY), driven by resilient consumer demand for premium indulgent foods amid inflation. NATH emphasizes quality (no by-products, gluten-free options) and innovation in a competitive Coney Island-style fast-casual space, positioning itself as a niche player in the $4.5B U.S. hot dog market and broader $300B+ quick-service restaurant (QSR) sector.

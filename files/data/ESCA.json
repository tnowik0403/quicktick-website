Founded in 1922 and headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, the company operates primarily through its Sporting Goods segment (96% of revenue), which includes table tennis equipment (e.g., Ping-Pong branded tables and paddles), basketball goals (Goalrilla, Goalsetter), pool and billiards (Mizerak, cue brands like Lucasi), darts, and indoor/outdoor games. The smaller Youth Recreation segment offers items like cornhole sets and shuffleboard. ESCA sells via mass merchants (Walmart, Amazon), sporting goods chains (Dick's Sporting Goods), direct-to-consumer e-commerce, and international distributors in over 60 countries. With ~800 employees, ESCA emphasizes branded, mid-to-premium products amid a fragmented $90B+ U.S. sporting goods market. Recent focus includes supply chain resilience post-COVID disruptions, e-commerce growth (now ~30% of sales), and margin expansion via pricing and sourcing efficiencies. Fiscal 2023 revenue was $318.1M (flat YoY), with Q2 2024 showing 9% growth driven by basketball and indoor games.

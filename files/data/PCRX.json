(NASDAQ: PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing innovative non-opioid pain management solutions to address the ongoing opioid crisis. Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, Pacira's flagship product, EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), is a long-acting local anesthetic approved for single-dose infiltration into surgical sites to produce postoperative analgesia. The company targets acute surgical pain across orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and other procedures, emphasizing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). Complementary products include ZILRETTA® (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension) for osteoarthritis knee pain via intra-articular injection, and iovera° (cryoneurolysis system) for cold therapy pain relief. Pacira also markets ZYNRELEF™ (meloxicam and bupivacaine ER solution), a non-opioid analgesic for soft tissue/bone procedures.\n\nWith a portfolio centered on multimodal, opioid-sparing therapies, Pacira operates in the ~$10-15B U.S. acute and chronic pain market, benefiting from regulatory tailwinds like FDA non-opioid incentives. Revenue is overwhelmingly driven by EXPAREL (~93% of net product sales), underscoring portfolio concentration risk. The company employs ~750 people, manufactures at FDA-approved facilities in San Diego, CA, and pursues label expansions, new indications, and commercial execution to drive adoption amid payer pressures and competition from generics.

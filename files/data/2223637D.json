It operates a portfolio of brands including foodpanda (Asia-Pacific and Europe), Glovo (Europe, Latin America, Africa), PedidosYa (Latin America), Talabat (Middle East), and Woowa Brothers (South Korea via Baemin). The company connects over 100,000 restaurants, grocers, and retailers with 40 million monthly active users across 70+ countries, processing 1 billion+ orders annually. Delivery Hero's core business is marketplace services (commissions from orders), supplemented by delivery-as-a-service (DAS) and quick commerce (q-commerce) via dark stores and pedelecs for groceries and essentials.\n\nIn recent years, Delivery Hero has shifted from hyper-growth to profitability focus post-IPO (2017). It reported record Q2 2024 results with Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) up 13% YoY to €11.3 billion and segment-adjusted EBITDA up 133% to €198 million. The company exited non-core markets (e.g., Taiwan sale to Uber for $1.0 billion in August 2024) to concentrate on high-growth regions like MENA (Talabat), APAC (Woowa), and Latin America. Quick commerce now represents ~15% of GMV, growing 80%+ YoY, positioning Delivery Hero against pure-play rivals like Gorillas (acquired) and Getir. With €1.2 billion cash post-Taiwan deal, it emphasizes organic expansion, tech investments (AI routing, dynamic pricing), and q-commerce scale. Market cap ~€6.7 billion as of October 11, 2024, with shares trading at ~€25.30.

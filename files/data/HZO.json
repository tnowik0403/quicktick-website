(NYSE: HZO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $29.85 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $682.3 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $22.51 - $42.00  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** 450,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nMarineMax, Inc. (HZO) is the nation's largest recreational boat and yacht retailer, operating as a one-stop marine lifestyle company. Headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, the company sells new and pre-owned pleasure boats, yachts, engines, parts, accessories, and provides related services including brokerage, yacht storage, maintenance, repair, fueling, and financing. It operates through over 130 locations across 20+ states in the U.S., primarily in high-growth regions like Florida, Texas, and the Northeast, under brands such as MarineMax, BOTSI (Boat Operations and Transport Services International), and Super Air Nautique (exclusive dealer). \n\nFounded in 1998, MarineMax has grown via organic expansion and 40+ acquisitions, capturing market share in the fragmented $50B+ U.S. recreational boating industry. It caters to affluent customers seeking luxury powerboats (e.g., Sea Ray, Boston Whaler) and super yachts (>80ft), with a focus on premiumization trends. The company also owns yacht brokerages like United Yacht Sales and offers ancillary services generating high-margin recurring revenue (e.g., service ~15-20% of sales). In FY2024 (ended Sep 30, 2024), MarineMax navigated a cyclical downturn but emphasized used boat sales and cost controls. Recent initiatives include international expansion via a Puerto Rico store opening (Aug 2024) and digital enhancements. With ~2,500 employees, HZO benefits from scale advantages in inventory management and financing partnerships, positioning it for recovery as interest rates ease.

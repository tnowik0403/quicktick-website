Headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, with ~186,000 employees across 45 countries, Lear designs, engineers, and manufactures automotive seating systems (including frames, mechanisms, foam, trim covers, and electronics) and electrical distribution systems (wire harnesses, terminals, connectors, junction boxes, and high-voltage solutions for EVs). In 2023, Lear generated $23.3 billion in net sales, with Seating contributing ~66% ($15.4B) and E-Systems ~34% ($7.9B). The company serves all major global OEMs, with a focus on premium comfort, safety, and electrification trends. Lear's competitive edge lies in vertical integration (from raw materials to assembly), global footprint (38% North America, 31% Europe/China, 31% Asia/South America), and innovation in lightweight materials and smart connectivity. Recent challenges include production cuts by OEMs amid high interest rates and inventory destocking, but tailwinds from EV/ADAS adoption position E-Systems for growth. Lear targets mid-single-digit operating margins through cost discipline and new program wins.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 29, 2024)**: Net sales $6.01 billion (-3% YoY); Core operating earnings $257 million (adjusted margin 4.3%); Adjusted net income $189 million ($3.27/share).

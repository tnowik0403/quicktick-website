(ECPG) is a global leader in specialty finance, focusing on the purchase and recovery of non-performing consumer debt portfolios. The company acquires defaulted receivables at steep discounts from banks, credit card issuers, utilities, and other lenders, then recovers value through a mix of legal and non-legal collections channels. Operating in two segments—U.S. (primarily Midland Credit Management, or MCM) and International (Cabot Credit Management in Europe, and operations in Latin America via Refinanciera)—Encore serves over 11 million consumer accounts annually. In FY2023, it generated $4.1B in revenue by purchasing $1.7B in portfolios. Encore emphasizes ethical collections, digital self-service portals, and data analytics to improve recovery rates (typically 20-30% of face value). With a presence in 11 countries, it navigates diverse regulations like the U.S. FDCPA and UK's Consumer Credit Act. Recent focus includes tech-driven efficiencies amid rising delinquencies from inflation and high interest rates, positioning Encore to capitalize on a $200B+ global charged-off debt market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Revenues $399.0M (↑5% YoY), driven by $353M in portfolio purchases (↑22% YoY).

Growth Strategy\n\n**Acquisition-Driven Growth**: Our total revenue growth of 14% for the year was driven by 6% organic growth and an 8% contribution from our disciplined and process-driven capital deployment capability. To this end, we deployed $3.6 billion of capital toward high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by Procare Solutions, a leading early childhood education software company, and Transact Campus, which was successfully combined with our\n\n**2025 Guidance**: Roper expects full year 2025 adjusted DEPS of $19.75 - $20.00 with first quarter adjusted DEPS of $4.70 - $4.74. The Company expects full year total revenue growth of 10%+, with organic revenue growth of +6 – 7%.\n\n**Strategic Focus Areas**:\n- Vertical software expansion in niche markets\n- AI-enhanced product development\n- With over 75% of revenue from software and more than two-thirds recurring, Roper's focus on niche markets is evident.\n\n## 6.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- **Mission-Critical Software**: Roper believes it has largely \"muted\" cyclicality and macro impacts due to the mission-critical nature of its software solutions and subscription-based pricing.\n- **Strong Cash Generation**: Strong Cash Flow Generation: Record free cash flow and a robust outlook highlight the inherent resilience and cash-generative nature of Roper's diversified portfolio.\n- **AI Innovation**: AI initiatives were noted as an area of investment, though not yet driving substantial revenue. Subsplash, for example, enhances its cloud-based software with AI-enabled features for its 20,000 organizational customers—a point management holds as promising for future development.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- **Foundry Challenges**: The company anticipates the impact of the recent actors' and writers' strikes in the media and entertainment industry to persist into 2025.

DAT and Loadlink experienced slight declines due to challenging market conditions affecting carrier and broker participation.\n- **M&A Competition**: While the M&A market is attractive with numerous sellers due to LP pressure, the company acknowledges that all buyers may become more discerning, potentially impacting competitive intensity on deals.\n\n## 9.

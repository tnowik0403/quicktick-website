Founded in 2010 as part of BW Group, Hafnia focuses on transporting refined petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, naphtha) and chemicals via a modern, eco-efficient fleet. As of Q3 2024, it operates ~123 vessels (90 product tankers, 33 chemical tankers), totaling ~3.3 million dwt, with an average vessel age of 5.8 years—among the youngest in the sector. The fleet is 100% owned (no charters in), enabling full control over operations and exposure to spot market rates.\n\nHafnia's business model emphasizes high utilization (95%+ in H1 2024), a mix of spot (~60-70%) and time charter exposure, and strategic fleet growth via selective newbuildings and acquisitions. It benefits from low breakeven costs (~$15k/day fleet-wide) and strong ESG credentials (ammonia/LNG-ready vessels). Revenue is generated primarily from time charter equivalents (TCE), with Q2 2024 fleet avg TCE at $308k/day. The company serves major oil majors and traders globally, navigating volatile tanker cycles driven by oil trade flows, geopolitical tensions, and fleet supply dynamics. Post-2023 NYSE listing (Jan 2023 at $9/share), Hafnia has delivered robust returns amid a product tanker upcycle, but faces normalizing rates ahead.

Strong fundamentals and tanker tailwinds support mid-cycle resilience, but peak rates (~$40k/day now vs. $20k trough) limit near-term blowout. Moderate risk appetite fits: low debt buffers downturns.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $7.00 (36% upside). Based on 6x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($1.1B est. EBITDA), 15% FCF yield at trough, and 10% NAV discount on $6B fleet value (Clarksons appraisals). Growth upside from newbuilds and low orderbook; target 12-month horizon.",

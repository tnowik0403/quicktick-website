(NYSE American: SENS) is a medical technology company focused on the design, development, and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for people with diabetes. Its flagship Eversense CGM platform features a fully implantable sensor that provides real-time glucose readings via a mobile app, transmitted through an external smart transmitter worn on the body. Unlike traditional fingerstick or short-term wearable CGMs, Eversense offers long-duration implants (90 days for Eversense E3), reducing user burden and improving adherence. Approved by the FDA in 2018 (initial version), 2022 (E3), and with expansions for ages 14+ in 2024, the system emphasizes accuracy, discreetness, and remote monitoring capabilities for patients and healthcare providers. Senseonics operates primarily in the U.S., with international expansion via partnerships. The company targets the $10B+ global CGM market, driven by rising diabetes prevalence (over 500M adults worldwide per IDF 2023 data). Challenges include high R&D costs, cash burn, and competition from non-implantable leaders. As of October 11, 2024, SENS trades at $0.615 with a market cap of $384.7M (Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq real-time data).

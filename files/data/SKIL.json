(SKIL) is a leading provider of cloud-based corporate learning and talent development platforms, offering a vast library of digital content focused on skills development, leadership training, business skills, and technology upskilling. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Durham, New Hampshire, the company serves over 7,000 enterprise customers worldwide, including 50% of the Fortune 100, through its flagship platforms: Skillsoft Percipio (an AI-powered learning experience platform with personalized content recommendations, practice labs, and coaching) and Skillsoft Leadership & Business (targeting executive development). Skillsoft's content library exceeds 12,000 courses, books, videos, and audiobooks, supplemented by partnerships for niche content. The company targets the $400+ billion global corporate learning market, emphasizing AI-driven personalization to address skills gaps in a post-pandemic hybrid work environment. Acquired via a 2021 SPAC merger with Churchill Capital Corp III, Skillsoft has faced headwinds from high debt loads (post-SPAC) and macroeconomic pressures but is pivoting toward high-margin content subscriptions and AI enhancements for growth. Recent strategic reviews amid liquidity challenges have positioned it for potential M&A or restructuring.

Moderate risk appetite investors should avoid amid 80% YTD decline.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $2.50/share (30% upside from $1.52). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 5% terminal growth) assuming EBITDA breakeven FY26 and 1x EV/sales multiple (peers avg. 3x discounted for distress); liquidation value ~$1.00/share floor. Strong growth portfolios should wait for M&A resolution. \n\n*Sources: Verified via Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, SEC EDGAR (10-Q/Q1 FY25 filed June 2024), Skillsoft IR site (earnings transcripts), Reuters/Bloomberg (news), Statista/Gartner (market data).

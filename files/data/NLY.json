Growth Strategy\n\n### Three-Pillar Strategy:\nAnnaly:The company's investment strategy is driven by the prudent selection of assets and effective capital allocation to achieve stable returns.

Also, a scaled MSR platform will continue to benefit from a low prepayment environment.\n\nThe company is focusing on improving its capabilities by acquiring newly originated MSRs from its partner network, which will continue to provide a strong advantage in expanding its MSR business.\n\n### Record Performance in Residential Credit:\nThis segment achieved several milestones during the quarter, including record quarterly lock volume of $6.2 billion and record quarterly securitization issuance of $3.9 billion. Annaly's Residential Credit Group remains the largest non-bank issuer and second-largest issuer overall of Prime Jumbo and Expanded Credit MBS.\n\n### MSR Expansion Strategy:\nNLY is enhancing its MSR platform through partnerships to strengthen scale and portfolio quality. In October 2025, the company entered a long-term subservicing and MSR purchase agreement with PennyMac Financial Services, leveraging PennyMac's strong servicing infrastructure and recapture capabilities. The partnership expands Annaly's servicing network and is expected to drive incremental cost control and operating flexibility, which, in turn, would result in potential long-term earnings accretion.\n\n## 6.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n**Declining Mortgage Rates**: According to a Freddie Mac report, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.19% as of Dec. 4, 2025, down from last week, when it averaged 6.23%. A year ago, at this time, the rates averaged 6.69%.\n\n**Federal Reserve Policy**: Also, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Sept. 17, 2025, to 4.00-4.25% and signaled the possibility of two additional reductions by year-end.\n\n**Improved Housing Market**: Housing affordability challenges are declining with lower mortgage rates. With rates trending lower and a balanced supply/affordability playing out in the mortgage market, loan demand is increasing. With this turnaround, mortgage originations and refinancing activities are witnessing a positive trend.\n\n### Headwinds:\n**Market Volatility**: However, any volatility in the mortgage market, unfavorable changes in the shape of the yield curve, interest-rate volatility, and deterioration of the generic financial conditions may affect the performance of the company's investments. Further, though the Fed rate cuts are likely to be advantageous for the company in the long term, the immediate impact on its performance might not reflect a significant change.\n\n**Industry Challenges**: However, significant headwinds include net interest margin compression during rate volatility, increased competition from fintech disruptors offering digital-first experiences, mounting regulatory compliance costs, and potential housing market corrections that could impact loan portfolios and default rates.\n\n**Credit Risk Concerns**: Annaly's credit risk has increased with its non-agency loans and mortgage serving rights, while agency-backed mortgage securities may face credit risk if the GSEs are sold. Trump is planning to IPO Fannie and Freddie, potentially pushing mortgage spreads back up if done without an explicit guarantee from the government, which may be politically unpopular.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAnnaly's Residential Credit Group remains the largest non-bank issuer and second-largest issuer overall of Prime Jumbo and Expanded Credit MBS.\n\nSince 2020, Annaly has expanded its MSR holdings to become a top 10 servicer of Agency MBS. The company's current MSR portfolio consists primarily of conventional loans with a weighted average FICO score of 757 at origination and an average note rate of 3.24%.\n\n### MSR Portfolio Scale:\nAnnaly's MSR portfolio consists of approximately 680,000 loans, totaling $219 billion in unpaid principal balance and $3.3 billion in market value as of June 30, 2025.

Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors:\nAnnaly's main competitors include other mortgage REITs such as AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC), Starwood Property Trust (NYSE:STWD), and New Residential Investment Corp (NYSE:NRZ), as well as diversified REITs and financial institutions that invest in mortgage-backed securities.\n\n### Annaly vs. AGNC Investment:\nAGNC holds only agency MBS, eliminating credit risk but increasing rate sensitivity; NLY diversifies with non-agency securities and MSRs, introducing moderate credit risk but more balanced rate protection. AGNC pays monthly dividends with a 13.73% forward yield and higher leverage (~7.2x–7.5x), while NLY pays quarterly at 12.28% yield and uses lower leverage (~5.7x–6.0x).\n\n### Performance Comparison:\nShares of Annaly have gained 14.7% in the past year against the industry's decline of 1.2%.

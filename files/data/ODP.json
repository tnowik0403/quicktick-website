Formerly known as Office Depot, Inc., it rebranded in 2021 to reflect its evolution from a traditional office retail chain into a B2B-focused powerhouse. ODP operates through three primary segments: Business Solutions Division (BSD, ~80% of revenue), Retail Division (~15%), and CompuCom Systems (~5%, IT services). \n\nBSD delivers workplace essentials including office supplies, technology products (computers, peripherals), print and document services, facilities management, and custom procurement solutions via brands like Office Depot, OfficeMax, and Varisource. It serves over 1 million customer accounts, emphasizing digital platforms, private-label brands (e.g., Realspace furniture, TUL writing instruments), and value-added services like managed print and IT support. Retail operates ~700 stores across the U.S., acting as showrooms and fulfillment centers for e-commerce. CompuCom provides end-to-user IT services, including managed services, cybersecurity, and digital workplace solutions.\n\nODP's strategy pivots toward recurring revenue streams from services (targeting 30%+ of BSD sales) amid e-commerce disruption. With ~$7.5B in annual sales (FY2023), it holds a strong position in the fragmented $350B+ U.S. office products and services market, leveraging scale, data analytics, and a hybrid omnichannel model. Challenges include retail contraction, but growth in SMB digital sales and enterprise contracts positions it for stability.

Moderate risk from cyclical SMB exposure balanced by services shift. Suitable for income/defensive portfolios, not strong growth.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $48.00  \n  (DCF-based: 8% WACC, 1% terminal growth; implies 19% upside. Peer comps support $45-52 range per BofA/Janney notes, Oct 2024.)",

Daily Volume:** 118,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCoya Therapeutics, Inc. (COYA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company headquartered in Austin, Texas, founded in 2020. The company specializes in developing novel Treg (regulatory T cell)-enhancing biologics to restore immune balance for treating neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases. Its pipeline targets high-unmet-need areas like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where immune dysregulation plays a key role.\n\nCoya's lead asset, COYA 301—a low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) formulation—aims to selectively expand and activate Tregs without overstimulating effector T cells. It is in a Phase 2 trial (SHINE study) for ALS, with topline efficacy data expected in Q4 2024. Additional assets include COYA 302 (IL-2 + abatacept fusion protein) for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and ALS, and treldumab (anti-LAG-3 antibody) for Alzheimer's. Coya's approach leverages academic discoveries from collaborators like Dr. David Hafler (Yale) and Dr. Howard Weiner (Harvard/MGH).\n\nAs a pre-revenue micro-cap biotech, Coya reported no revenues in Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), with a net loss of $5.0 million and R&D expenses of $3.9 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments stood at $25.6 million as of June 30, 2024, providing runway into H2 2025. The company has ~10 employees and emphasizes efficient capital use for clinical milestones.

Positive ALS biomarkers + Q4 catalyst outweigh biotech risks; undervalued vs. peers on pipeline density.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $15.00 (107% upside). DCF-based (50% Phase 3 success prob., ALS peak $600M sales @ 20x multiple, 25% discount rate); aligns with H.C. Wainwright $18 PT (Sep 2024). Moderate risk: Hold for catalysts, sell on data miss.",

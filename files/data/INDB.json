(NASDAQ: INDB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 21, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $60.46  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $3.38 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $42.31 – $64.58  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 11.62  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.68% (quarterly dividend $0.56/share, ex-date Oct 4, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nIndependent Bank Corp. (INDB) is a Massachusetts-based bank holding company headquartered in Rockland, MA, operating primarily through its subsidiary Rockland Trust Company. Founded in 1901, the company provides a full suite of commercial banking, retail banking, and private banking services to individuals, small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), municipalities, and nonprofits across Eastern Massachusetts, Cape Cod, and Rhode Island. With ~80 full-service branches and a network of ATMs, Rockland Trust focuses on relationship banking in affluent suburban and coastal markets, emphasizing commercial real estate (CRE) lending (58% of loan portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (20%), and residential mortgages.\n\nThe bank differentiates via personalized service, community involvement (e.g., $10M+ in annual charitable contributions), and integrated wealth management through Rockland Wealth Management, which oversees $8.2B in assets under management/custody (AUM/AUC) as of Q3 2024. INDB's deposit franchise is sticky, with 70%+ core deposits (non-time) and a loan-to-deposit ratio of ~92%. It serves a stable regional economy driven by healthcare, education, biotech, and tourism. Recent balance sheet: $18.7B in total assets (Q3 2024). INDB trades at a discount to regional bank peers due to CRE exposure but benefits from disciplined underwriting and improving net interest margins (NIM) amid rate normalization.

Solimar featured a traditional interface design that many users found intuitive for campaign setup, optimization, and reporting.\n\n• **Unified ID 2.0 (UID2)**: Unified ID 2.0 (UID 2.0) launched as a second iteration to leverage a post-cookie internet using encrypted email and phone number data to create a secure identity standard.\n\n• **OpenPath**: A product for creating a direct supply path to specific sell-side partners.

The Trade Desk's platform reaches over 90 million households through CTV.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Kokai AI Platform**: Launched June 6, 2023, Kokai is a new approach to digital advertising innovation that incorporates major advances in distributed artificial intelligence (AI), measurement, partner integrations and a revolutionary, intuitive user experience. In a major advancement in programmatic AI, Kokai distributes deep learning algorithms across all aspects of the digital media buying process.\n\n**Ventura Operating System**: The Trade Desk just launched a new TV operating system, Ventura. Unlike existing TV OS platforms, The Trade Desk is built by an ad tech company, and the company claims that Ventura will offer a cleaner supply chain for streaming advertising and a better user experience. The company expects Ventura to be deployed by TV manufacturers as early as next year, and it has found support from major streaming platforms like Disney, Paramount, and Tubi.\n\n**OpenAds**: TTD says OpenAds is not just a reaction to Prebid's TID change, but a new model for fairer, more transparent ad auctions.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nCTV Dominance: Nearly 50% of TTD's revenue now comes from video, driven by the move of Disney, Netflix, and Warner Bros. Discovery toward ad-supported tiers. Retail Media 2.0: TTD has integrated with the world's largest retailers, including Walmart and Kroger. This allows advertisers to close the loop: showing an ad on a smart TV and then tracking if that consumer later bought the product at a retail store using anonymized purchase data.\n\nIn December, they undertook a reorganization to accelerate opportunities across CTV, retail media, identity, supply chain optimization, and audio while forging ahead with innovations like Kokai and the Ventura Operating System.\n\nThey spent last year making sure that brands and advertisers have the tools necessary for capitalizing on this explosive market, from their groundbreaking partnerships with Disney, Netflix, and Roku, to their cutting-edge tech that supports local targeting and omnichannel buying.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe Trade Desk serves over 1,100 enterprise-level advertising clients globally. The platform supports over 1.3 million advertisers and processes more than $6.2 billion in annual advertising spend.\n\nThe platform hosts 2,300 small and medium-sized businesses with monthly advertising budgets ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. The Trade Desk supports 1,850 performance marketing professionals across various industries. The platform serves 215 global brand advertisers with total annual advertising spend of $4.6 billion.\n\nIt has over 225 partners worldwide, and is responsible for delivering personalized content on Spotify.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Results**: The Trade Desk delivered $2.4 billion of revenue – marking accelerated growth of 26% year over year – and a record $12 billion of spend on our platform. Q4 revenue was $741.0M, up 22% YoY; GAAP diluted EPS was $0.36 and Adjusted EBITDA was $350.0M with a 47% margin.\n\n**Full Year 2024**: Full‑year 2024 revenue reached $2.445B (+26% YoY) and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.011B; gross spend on the platform hit a record $12B and customer retention remained over 95%.\n\n**Financial Strength**: The company generated $225 million in net cash from operating activities in Q3 2025, with free cash flow totaling $155 million. As of the end of Q3 2025, the company maintained a debt-free balance sheet and held about $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\n\n**Margins**: It averaged an excellent 78.8% gross margin over the last year. This quarter, The Trade Desk's gross profit margin was 78.1%, down 2.4 percentage points year on year.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nAmazon's DSP has grown from 40% of all digital ad buyers to 46%, while Google's use has dropped from 36% to 33%. Amazon is the most used DSP, followed by The Trade Desk, with Google settling into third.\n\nThe Trade Desk is one of the largest independent DSPs in the world. It offers robust tools for buying ads across display, video, audio, and emerging channels like Connected TV (CTV) and Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH).\n\nThe Trade Desk seems to have surpassed Google in the amount bought on the open internet, according to industry experts who analyzed the antitrust trial exhibits.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Main Competitors**: Major competitors include 'walled gardens' like Google, with its Campaign Manager 360 and DV360, and Meta, through Facebook Ads and Instagram Ads. Amazon Ads has become a significant competitor, particularly its DSP.\n\n**Competitive Positioning**: The Trade Desk positions itself as an unbiased and transparent partner for advertisers. Unlike Google, The Trade Desk does not own any media or content. This means it has no incentive to favor one publisher's inventory over another. Its goal is to provide advertisers with the best possible placements across the entire open internet.\n\n**Revenue Comparison**: DV360 booked $2.2 billion and netted $438 million in 2020, whereas TTD had $4.2 billion in gross revenue and $836 million in net revenue the same year.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Strategic Partnerships**:\n• In March 2024, NBCUniversal announced that its broadcast content for the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics would be available, in partnership with The Trade Desk, to online automated programmatic marketers, for the first time.\n• In May 2024, Netflix announced its first expansion of its advertising partnerships to include The Trade Desk, Magnite, and Google DV360.\n• Amazon Ads and Netflix recently announced a partnership that will make Netflix's ad-supported inventory available programmatically through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) in more than a dozen major markets.\n\n**Acquisition**: OpenPath and Sincera: OpenPath poised to scale in 2025; Sincera's metadata will improve supply transparency and price discovery.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Q4 2024 Performance Miss**: After 33 consecutive earning periods of meeting (or exceeding) financial expectations, The Trade Desk missed analyst expectations by about 2% in Q4 2024. Despite reporting growth, the stock tumbled by more than 32% in February 2025 after missing this target.\n\n**Major Reorganization**: In December, they undertook a reorganization to accelerate opportunities across CTV, retail media, identity, supply chain optimization, and audio while forging ahead with innovations like Kokai and the Ventura Operating System. This represented the \"largest reorganization in company history.\"\n\n**Kokai Platform Challenges**: Early adopters report results: 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower cost per acquisition. Yet, only two-thirds of clients have migrated, with many clinging to the legacy Solimar platform due to Kokai's steep learning curve.\n\n**Competitive Pressures**: MoffettNathanson analyst said the recent integrations of Amazon's DSP with Roku and Disney are \"a net negative\" for Trade Desk. The analyst has a 'Neutral' rating on Trade Desk stock.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7/10 (Buy)**\n\n**Rationale for Rating**:\n\n**Strengths** (Supporting factors for Buy rating):\n• The Trade Desk is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 5.2 months this quarter. The company's rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation.\n• Customer retention remained over 95% during the year, as it has for the past eleven consecutive years.\n• According to 35 analysts, the average rating for TTD stock is \"Buy.\" The 12-month stock price target is $77.71, which is an increase of 108.67% from the latest price.\n• Strong financial position with debt-free balance sheet and $1.4 billion in cash\n• Leading position in high-growth Connected TV market\n\n**Headwinds and Risks**:\n• With Netflix, Roku, and Disney inventory increasingly accessible through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk risks losing some of the premium authenticated CTV supply that has been central to its growth story. Amazon has a closed-loop ecosystem that includes e-commerce, CTV hardware, and Prime Video, providing it with unmatched data for precise audience targeting.\n• The primary risk to TTD is commoditization. If Amazon and Google drive ad-tech fees to the floor, TTD's 15-20% take rate may become harder to justify for price-sensitive brands.\n• Kokai platform transition challenges affecting near-term performance\n• Slowing revenue growth from 26% to projected 17-18% in 2025\n\n**Fair Value Price Target: $75-80**\n\nThis target represents approximately 100% upside from current levels around $37, based on:\n- Strong fundamentals with 78%+ gross margins and positive free cash flow\n- Market leadership in independent DSP space\n- Growing CTV market opportunity (forecasted to overtake linear TV by 2029)\n- Current valuation discount due to temporary execution issues\n- Analyst consensus average of $77.71 price target\n\nThe stock appears significantly undervalued following the 68% decline in 2025, presenting a compelling value opportunity for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk appetite willing to navigate competitive headwinds and platform transition challenges.",

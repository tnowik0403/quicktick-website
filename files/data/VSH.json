In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information.

(NYSE: VSH), founded in 1962 and headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components. The company operates through five segments: Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), Diodes, Optoelectronic Components, Resistors, and Inductors. Its portfolio serves diverse end-markets including automotive (e.g., EVs, ADAS), industrial (e.g., power supplies, motors), computing/consumer (e.g., smartphones, appliances), telecommunications/infrastructure (e.g., 5G base stations), and aerospace/defense/medical. With approximately 23,500 employees across 19 countries and manufacturing in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, Vishay generates over 50% of revenue from Asia (primarily China). In FY2023, it reported $3.4 billion in sales, emphasizing high-margin, custom, and harsh-environment products. Vishay differentiates via vertical integration, broad product breadth (over 50,000 SKUs), and innovation in silicon carbide (SiC) and power components amid electrification trends.

Moderate risk portfolio suits hold; strong growth seekers await Q4 stabilization.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $27.00** (22% upside; DCF-based on 5% sales CAGR 2025-28, 35% margins, 10x exit; per consensus from Yahoo/BofA Oct 2024).",

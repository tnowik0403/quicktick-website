(NASDAQ: CRWS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 4, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $2.67 (closing price as of October 3, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $27.79 million (as of October 3, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $1.80 - $3.35  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** ~15,000 shares (low liquidity, microcap)  \n\n## Company Overview\nCRWS Inc. is a holding company primarily operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Broadway Licensing Global, LLC (BLG), a leading licensor of stage plays and musicals for amateur, educational, stock, and professional theater productions worldwide. Founded in 2019 via acquisition, BLG manages a curated portfolio of over 300 titles, spanning classics like Thornton Wilder's *Our Town* and Arthur Miller's *Death of a Salesman* to contemporary works such as *The Musical of Musicals (The Musical!)* and new commissions. Revenue is generated almost exclusively from royalty fees, calculated as a percentage (typically 6-10%) of gross box office receipts from licensed performances, plus script sales and digital rights.\n\nBLG serves a diverse client base including high schools, community theaters, universities, regional professional companies, and international venues in 50+ countries. The company emphasizes digital innovation, offering e-scripts, virtual production tools, and streaming licenses post-COVID. Headquartered in New York City, CRWS employs ~20 people and benefits from strong author estate relationships. In FY2023 (ended Sept 30), it licensed ~10,000 productions, underscoring its niche dominance in non-musical and smaller-scale musical licensing. While the live theater sector faces cyclical pressures, CRWS's asset-light model (no production costs) yields high gross margins (~85%), though it contends with low revenue scale ($5-6M annually) and sensitivity to economic downturns impacting discretionary arts spending.

Daily Volume**: 120,000 shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: 6.52 million\n- **Enterprise Value**: $412 million (includes $354M net debt)\n\n## Company Overview\nLee Enterprises, Incorporated (LEE) is a leading U.S. provider of local news, information, and marketing services, operating in 72 markets across 20 states. The company publishes 75 daily newspapers—including titles like the Lincoln Journal Star, Omaha World-Herald, and Buffalo News—and reaches 74 million unique monthly digital users via 350+ local websites and apps. Founded in 1890, LEE has transitioned from a print-centric model to a diversified digital-first strategy, emphasizing subscription revenue, digital advertising, and niche marketing services. With Berkshire Hathaway holding a ~19% stake (valued at ~$11M as of latest 13F filing on August 14, 2024), LEE benefits from a low-float structure that amplifies volatility. Total revenue for FY2023 was $624 million, with digital revenue comprising 34% (up from 28% in FY2021). The company employs ~5,000 people and focuses on hyper-local content to combat national media fragmentation. Amid industry contraction, LEE's scale positions it as the #2 U.S. newspaper publisher by circulation (behind Gannett), serving middle-market communities with essential classifieds in automotive, real estate, and employment.

Overall revenue CAGR -2% to flat through FY2026.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q3 FY24) | LEE | Gannett (GCI) | News Corp (NWSA) | NY Times (NYT) |\n|----------------------------|-----|---------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Market Cap**            | $58M | $1.2B        | $16B            | $9.5B        |\n| **Revenue**               | $631M | $2.9B       | $10B            | $2.6B        |\n| **Digital Rev %**         | 36%  | 45%         | 50%             | 41%          |\n| **EBITDA Margin**         | 14%  | 12%         | 18%             | 22%          |\n| **EV/EBITDA**             | 14x  | 8x          | 12x             | 22x          |\n| **Key Edge**              | Local classifieds strength | Scale | Global diversification | National subs |\n\nLEE trades at discount to peers on EV/EBITDA due to debt, but outperforms Gannett in sub growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Block (Square) for payments (2023); Google News Initiative (ongoing AI tools); Amazon DSP for ad tech (expanded 2024).\n- **M&A**: Acquired BH Media/Buffett papers (2020, $140M); no major deals in 2024; monitoring tuck-ins under $50M.\n- **Major Clients**: Local advertisers (auto dealers like AutoNation, realtors via Zillow leads); national brands (Procter & Gamble via programmatic). Potential: Political ad surge 2024 elections; enterprise subs from govt/municipalities.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community ties (local journalism awards); improving diversity hires (30% workforce).\n- **Management**: CEO Gordon Crofoot (since 2022) focused on deleveraging; insider ownership 2%.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (antitrust on news mergers); tech disruption (AI news generators).\n- **Opportunities**: Local news scarcity; M&A consolidation wave post-Gannett/Newhouse deals.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Digital transition supports modest growth (3-5% CAGR), but high debt (4x EBITDA) and print erosion cap rerating. Suitable for moderate risk; strong growth upside requires deleveraging success.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $12.50/share (40% upside). Based on 10x FY2025E EBITDA ($45M) + net debt adjustment; DCF assumes 2% rev growth, 18% margins by 2027 (per consensus from Seeking Alpha/Yahoo, October 2024).",

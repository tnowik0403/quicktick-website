(NYSE: WMS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $163.50 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $12.72 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $93.02 - $184.28  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (ADS or WMS) is a leading North American manufacturer of thermoplastic corrugated pipe and complementary water management products. Founded in 1966 and headquartered in Hilliard, Ohio, the company designs, produces, and distributes solutions primarily for stormwater management, drainage, sanitation, and agriculture applications. Its core products include N-12 HDPE pipe, which dominates the corrugated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe market due to superior durability, hydraulic performance, and installation efficiency compared to traditional concrete, metal, or PVC alternatives.\n\nADS serves three main end markets: infrastructure (40-45% of sales, including municipal stormwater and erosion control), residential (35-40%, tied to new home construction), and agriculture (15-20%, for subsurface drainage). The company operates ~70 manufacturing facilities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, with a vertically integrated model including in-house resin compounding and private brand distribution via SiteOne Landscape Supply (a key partner).\n\nWith the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in 2021, ADS has positioned itself as a prime beneficiary of federal spending on water infrastructure, roadways, and flood mitigation. FY2024 revenue reached $3.68 billion (up 11% YoY), driven by market share gains and acquisitions, though residential exposure introduces cyclicality. ADS targets resilient growth through product innovation, capacity expansion, and bolt-on M&A, aiming for mid-single-digit organic growth amid secular tailwinds in water management.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (Reported Oct 9, 2024):** Net sales $717.8 million (vs. consensus $680.5M, +5.5% YoY); Adj.

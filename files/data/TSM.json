It provides various wafer fabrication processes, such as processes to manufacture complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others. Its products are used in high performance computing, smartphones, Internet of things, automotive, and digital consumer electronics.\n\nFounded in 1987, TSMC pioneered the pure-play foundry business model, serving as the manufacturing backbone for fabless semiconductor companies worldwide. The key success factor of TSMC is said to be their decision to become a pure-play foundry business, meaning no end-customer relations or own products. By choosing not to market any semiconductor products under its own name, TSMC can ensure that their incentives are well-aligned with their customers.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Financial Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent)\n\n**Revenue Performance:**\n- Revenue reached $33.1 billion, marking a 10.1% sequential increase\n- Revenue rose 30.3% to NT$989.9 billion ($33.1 billion), beating analyst forecasts and setting a new quarterly record\n- EPS rose by 39% year-over-year\n\n**Profitability Metrics:**\n- Gross margin improved to 59.5%, up 0.9 percentage points sequentially and 1.7 points year-over-year; operating margin rose to 50.6%\n- Net profit margin was 45.7%, up 3.0 points from 2Q25\n- EPS was NT$17.44, up 13.6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year; ROE was 37.8%\n\n**Technology Mix:**\n- Advanced technologies accounted for 74% of wafer revenue\n- 3-nanometer process technology contributed 23% of wafer revenue\n\n### Q4 2025 Guidance\n- TSMC expects revenue to range between USD 32.2 billion and USD 33.4 billion, which would represent a 1% sequential decrease but a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint\n- Gross margin is projected to be between 59% and 61%, while operating margin is anticipated to be between 49% and 51%\n\n---\n\n## Recent Developments & Strategic Initiatives\n\n### Goldman Sachs Upgrade (January 2026)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares climbed by the most since April, as the world's largest contract chipmaker rides a continued wave of optimism over artificial intelligence demand into the new year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its TSMC price target 35% to NT$2,330, citing expectations of another year of solid growth.\n\nSales are projected to increase by 30% in 2026 and 28% in 2027, representing a substantial rise from prior forecasts of 22% in both years. TSMC is expected to spend more than $150 billion in capex from 2026-2028, including $54 billion in 2027 (gross margins above 60%).\n\n### U.S. Export License (January 2026)\nThe immediate catalyst for the recent surge was a regulatory decision from the U.S. Department of Commerce on January 1. TSMC secured an annual export license for its fabrication facility in Nanjing, China, covering U.S. equipment and other controlled goods.\n\n### Advanced Packaging Capacity Expansion\nBy the end of 2025, TSMC successfully nearly doubled its CoWoS output to 75,000 wafers per month, and current projections for 2026 suggest the company will hit a staggering 130,000 wafers per month by year-end.\n\nBy scaling CoWoS capacity from approximately 35,000 wafers per month in late 2024 to a projected 130,000 wafers per month by the close of 2026, TSMC is effectively widening the narrowest pipe in the global technology supply chain\n\n---\n\n## Growth Strategy & Technology Roadmap\n\n### Advanced Node Leadership\n- TSMC's 2nm technology is on track for production\n- N2 is well on track for volume production later this quarter. Introducing N2P as an extension of our N2 family. Introducing A16 featuring our best-in-class Super Power Rail or SPR.\n\n### Geographic Expansion\n- TSM is accelerating its second Arizona fab, with 3nm production now targeted for 2027 instead of 2028\n- Much of this spending supports expansion in both Taiwan and the United States. The chipmaker is already building two major factories in Arizona, part of a long-term plan to invest over $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing.\n\n### Capital Investment Strategy\n- CapEx for 2025 narrowed to $40B-$42B, with 70% allocated to advanced process technologies\n- 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies. 10% to 20% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making, and others.\n\n---\n\n## Market Position & Competitive Dynamics\n\n### Market Share Leadership\nTSMC is rapidly gaining foundry market share and now has a credible path to high 40s or even 50%.\n\n### CoWoS Advanced Packaging Dominance\nNVIDIA dominates the capacity demand, accounting for a significant 63% of the total demand, indicating its leadership position in adopting CoWoS technology. Broadcom follows at 13%, marking it as the second-largest contributor to CoWoS demand, albeit far behind NVIDIA. AMD and Marvell each share 8%, tying for the third spot\n\nNVIDIA remains the dominant force and the \"anchor tenant\" of TSMC's packaging lines, reportedly securing over 60% of the total CoWoS capacity for 2025 and 2026.\n\n### Competitive Moat\nThis massive capacity build-out also serves as a defensive moat for TSMC. While competitors like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung (KRX: 005930) are racing to develop their own advanced packaging solutions (such as Intel's Foveros), TSMC's sheer scale and proven yield rates for CoWoS-L have made it the nearly exclusive partner for high-end AI silicon.\n\n---\n\n## Key Customer Base & Partnerships\n\n### Major Clients\nIt is said that Apple accounts for roughly one-fifth of TSMC's revenue, and other customers on the list are Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm.\n\n### NVIDIA Partnership\nNvidia is scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies and has approached contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to ramp up production, sources said. Chinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds ​just 700,000 units in stock\n\n---\n\n## End Market Segments\n\n### High-Performance Computing (Leading Segment)\nFor perspective, in Q3 2025, TSMC reported $33.1 billion in sales for its high-performance computing platform, accounting for 57% of sales, compared to 30% from smartphones.\n\n### Smartphone Recovery\nSmartphones, long considered a mature and cyclical segment, surprised to the upside. The segment contributed 30% of revenue, up 19% sequentially, driven by new flagship launches and restocking by OEMs ahead of the holiday season.\n\n### AI-Driven Demand\nStrong demand in AI, smartphone, and automotive segments. By 2030, analysts expect AI chips to make up more than 25% of TSMC's total revenue, compared with less than 10% in 2020.\n\n---\n\n## Headwinds & Risks\n\n### Geopolitical Risks\n- Recent Chinese military encirclement exercises and live-fire drills around Taiwan have once again highlighted the island's geopolitical tensions\n- The concentration of advanced packaging capacity in Taiwan remains a point of concern for global supply chain resilience\n\n### Supply Chain Constraints\n- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) controls advanced packaging capacity that determines which AI chipmakers can scale production. Google reportedly cut its 2026 TPU production target from 4 million to 3 million units due to limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor's CoWoS packaging.\n\n### Competitive Pressure\n- Intel's EMIB advanced packaging is becoming one of the alternative solutions for chip companies. Compared with CoWoS, EMIB has several advantages. Firstly, the structure is simplified. EMIB abandons the expensive and large-area interposer and directly interconnects the chips using a silicon bridge embedded in the carrier board, simplifying the overall structure and having a higher yield rate than CoWoS.\n\n---\n\n## Tailwinds & Opportunities\n\n### AI Supercycle\n- Analyst Bruce Lu argues that demand for AI \"tokens\" is growing at an exponential pace, keeping advanced-chip demand ahead of supply. That imbalance gives TSMC significant leverage, even as it spends heavily to expand its capacity.\n- AI demand continues to be very strong, even stronger than anticipated three months ago. The previously announced growth rate for AI accelerators was in the mid-40s, but it is expected to be slightly better.\n\n### Technology Leadership\n- TSM's 2026 price hikes and better‑than‑expected 2nm yields support a plausible new gross margin plateau above 60% from Q4 FY25 onward.\n- In particular, the tight capacity at TSMC's most advanced 3nm and 5nm nodes will persist through 2027.\n\n### Packaging Innovation\n- TSMC's aggressive expansion of its CoWoS capacity is the final piece of the puzzle for the current AI boom. By resolving the packaging bottlenecks that defined 2024 and 2025, the company has cleared the way for a massive influx of high-performance hardware. The move cements TSMC's role as the foundation of the AI era\n\n---\n\n## Current Valuation Metrics\n\n### Stock Performance\n- The Hsinchu-based firm's shares surged 44% in 2025, pushing its market value above $1 trillion for the first time.

Company Overview\n\nThe Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks a basket of MLP stocks, specifically focused on energy infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that earn the majority of their cash flow from midstream activities involving energy commodities. The fund is based on the Alerian MLP Infrastructure index, a market-cap-weighted index of publicly-traded energy infrastructure MLPs in the US. The fund seeks investment results that correspond (before fees and expenses) generally to the price and yield performance of its underlying index, the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index (AMZI).\n\nStructured as a C-corporation, the fund allows full allocation to MLPs, unlike traditional ETFs that can only hold 25% of their portfolios in MLPs. However, this structure introduces a layer of taxation that prevents it from passing through the full return of its underlying index. AMLP celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2025, having been launched on August 24, 2010, making it one of the most established funds in the MLP sector with significant scale and liquidity.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nAMLP provides diversified energy‑sector exposure through a portfolio of MLPs, making it well‑suited for income‑focused investors. The fund's core service is providing investors with:\n\n• **MLP Infrastructure Exposure**: The underlying index is comprised of energy infrastructure MLPs that earn a majority of their cash flow from the transportation, storage and processing of energy commodities\n• **High Dividend Yield**: Current yield of 8.24% with quarterly distributions\n• **Simplified Tax Structure**: The Alerian MLP ETF distributes a single Form 1099 to its shareholders, avoiding the complex K-1 tax forms typically associated with direct MLP ownership\n• **Professional Portfolio Management**: Passive index tracking with quarterly rebalancing\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nAs a passive index ETF, AMLP does not develop new products but benefits from the infrastructure projects and expansions of its underlying holdings. Key planned developments in the MLP sector include:\n\n• **LNG Export Infrastructure**: Cheniere (LNG) announced first LNG at its Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion in late December, while Venture Global's Plaquemines Phase 1 shipped its first LNG cargo last month\n• **Pipeline Expansions**: Enterprise Product Partners received its deepwater port license for the Sea Port Oil Terminal (\"SPOT\"), allowing it to proceed with the construction of its offshore oil export terminal. Set to go live by 2026, the SPOT terminal is expected to increase oil export capacity by as much as 2 million barrels per day (bpd)\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nAMLP's growth strategy is inherently tied to the performance and expansion of the underlying MLP sector:\n\n• **Free Cash Flow Generation**: In 2026, midstream companies are expected to continue executing on dividend growth and opportunistic buybacks as they generate free cash flow. Heading into 2026, the sector remains well-positioned to generate free cash flow, supporting continued dividend growth and buybacks\n• **Distribution Growth**: Midstream MLPs and corporations are expected to continue executing on dividend growth. For most, dividend growth will be in the mid-single-digits, though Targa Resources (TRGP), MPLX (MPLX), Plains All American (PAA/PAGP) and Cheniere Energy (LNG) have guided to heftier growth\n• **Natural Gas Infrastructure Focus**: North American midstream is likely to continue benefiting from rising natural gas production volumes over the coming years, as throughputs grow and contract fees escalate. Increased processing volumes of natural gas liquids (NGLs) such as propane, butane, and ethane, alongside LNG terminal completions, are expected to support continued production growth\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAs an ETF, AMLP serves individual and institutional investors seeking energy infrastructure exposure. Among the largest hedge funds holding AMLP's share is Searcy Financial Services Inc /Adv. It holds AMLP's shares valued at 17M.\n\nThe fund's target client base includes:\n• Income-focused individual investors\n• Institutional investors seeking energy diversification\n• Portfolio managers looking for defensive energy exposure\n• Retirement accounts seeking high-yield investments\n\n## 6.

Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nAs a passive ETF, AMLP does not engage in direct M&A activity, but benefits from consolidation within the MLP sector. The fund's holdings have been active in:\n\n• **Buyback Programs**: Over 70% of AMZI and AMEI by weighting having repurchase authorizations in place as of December 4. With its buyback authorization upsized by $3 billion and expectations for greater free cash flow, Enterprise Products Partners' (EPD) repurchase activity bears watching next year\n• **Infrastructure Partnerships**: Major holdings continue to form strategic partnerships for pipeline and terminal development\n\n## 11.

In 2026, midstream companies are expected to continue executing on dividend growth and opportunistic buybacks as they generate free cash flow\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Rating: 7.2/10\n\n**Rationale:**\n• **Positive Factors**: High sustainable yield (8.24%), strong cash flow generation from underlying MLPs, attractive valuations relative to historical averages, and benefit from growing natural gas infrastructure demand\n• **Moderate Concerns**: Corporate tax structure creates performance drag, concentrated portfolio, and sector-specific risks from commodity price volatility\n• **Growth Prospects**: Looking toward 2026, fundamentals appear steady rather than explosive. Beyond the near term, longer-term demand drivers remain intact\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $52.00 - $55.00\n\n**Basis for Valuation:**\n• **Current Technical Range**: 52-week range spans from 43.75 to 53.24\n• **Valuation Metrics**: AMZI was trading at 8.66x on an EV/EBITDA basis using 2026 consensus estimates compared to its ten-year average of 9.9x, suggesting potential for rerating\n• **Income Component**: High distribution yield provides strong support for current valuation levels\n• **Sector Outlook**: Company-level tailwinds from free cash flow, a cautious oil outlook, expectations for moderate production growth, and the potential for good news from Washington on the policy front all contribute to a constructive view for midstream/MLPs\n\n**Recommendation**: AMLP represents a solid income-focused investment for moderate risk portfolios seeking energy infrastructure exposure, with potential for modest capital appreciation and consistent distribution growth.",

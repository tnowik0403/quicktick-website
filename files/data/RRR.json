(NYSE: RRR) is a leading operator of regional casinos and entertainment properties primarily serving the Las Vegas locals market. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company owns and operates 11 properties through its Station Casinos brand, including flagship destinations like Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa, Green Valley Ranch, and Palace Station. These properties offer gaming (slots, table games), hotels, dining, entertainment, and loyalty programs tailored to Nevada residents rather than tourists. RRR focuses on the underserved \"locals\" segment, which accounts for ~25% of the Las Vegas gaming market but generates higher margins due to repeat customers and lower marketing costs.\n\nThe company was spun off from Station Casinos in 2016 and went public via an IPO. It emphasizes operational efficiency, player loyalty via the Boarding Pass rewards program (over 4 million members as of Q2 2024), and capital allocation toward development and dividends. RRR returned $153.8 million to shareholders in FY2023 via buybacks and dividends. Recent expansion includes the $550 million Durango Casino Resort, opened March 28, 2024, targeting Southwest Las Vegas growth. With a debt load managed post-COVID recovery, RRR benefits from Las Vegas' rebound, posting record revenues. However, it faces cyclical risks from economic downturns and competition.

(WM) is the largest integrated waste management company in North America, providing comprehensive environmental services including collection, transfer, recycling, resource recovery, and disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW), non-hazardous industrial waste, construction and demolition debris, and hazardous waste. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, WM operates approximately 260 landfills, 320 transfer stations, 90 recycling facilities, and a fleet of over 27,000 collection vehicles across the U.S. and Canada. The company serves more than 20 million residential customers and over 600,000 commercial/industrial accounts, generating revenue primarily from collection (60%+), landfill operations (25%), and recycling (10%).

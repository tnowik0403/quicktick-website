We estimate that the market will return to its more historical earnings multiple of 29 by the end of 2030, giving us a target price of $476.47 per share.\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.5/10**\n\n**Rationale:** \nWM demonstrates strong defensive characteristics with predictable cash flows, market-leading position, and substantial capital return program. The recent 14.5% dividend increase and $3B share buyback program underscore management's confidence. However, elevated leverage from the Stericycle acquisition (3.1x debt-to-equity) and commodity price volatility present near-term risks. The sustainability transformation and healthcare expansion provide long-term growth catalysts.\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $255**\n\nBased on the consensus analyst target of ~$251 and considering the company's strong market position, consistent cash generation, and growth investments in sustainability, a fair value of $255 represents approximately 17% upside from current levels, suitable for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance.",

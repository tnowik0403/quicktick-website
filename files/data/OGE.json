(NYSE: OGE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 4, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $40.25 (as of market close Nov 4, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $8.02 billion (as of Nov 4, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $33.27 - $43.44  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nOGE Energy Corp. (OGE) is a fully regulated electric utility holding company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, primarily operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E). OG&E delivers electricity to approximately 897,000 retail customers across a 30,000-square-mile service territory in Oklahoma and portions of western Arkansas, making it the largest investor-owned utility in Oklahoma. The company generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric energy, with a regulated rate base of about $9.5 billion as of year-end 2023. OGE's generation fleet totals ~7,800 MW, including natural gas (66%), coal (20%), wind (10%), and solar (4%), with a strategic shift toward renewables. In 2023, OGE completed a transformative corporate restructuring by spinning off its former natural gas midstream business (Enogex/Enable) into ONEOK, Inc., allowing OGE to focus exclusively on its stable, regulated electric utility operations. This pure-play structure enhances earnings predictability, supports consistent dividend growth (52-year streak as of 2024), and aligns with investor demand for defensive utility stocks. OGE benefits from Oklahoma's growing economy, driven by energy, aerospace (e.g., Tinker AFB), and manufacturing, while navigating regulatory oversight from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC). The company emphasizes reliability (99.9%+ SAIDI/SAIFI metrics), affordability (among lowest residential rates in U.S.), and clean energy transitions, positioning it for steady 5-7% EPS growth through capex-driven rate base expansion.

(ISPO) is a technology-driven luxury hospitality company founded in 2011 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado. It operates a subscription-based platform providing affluent consumers with access to a curated portfolio of over 150,000 premium accommodations worldwide, including hand-selected vacation homes, apartments, resorts, and cruises. The core offering is the Inspirato Club subscription, where members pay an annual fee (starting at ~$600/month equivalent) for 7-42 nights per year, plus per-night dynamic pricing (~$1,000-$5,000/night). Non-subscribers can book a la carte via the app or website. Inspirato emphasizes \"five-star service\" with dedicated Trip Managers, 24/7 concierge, housekeeping, and experiences like private chefs or adventures. Revenue streams include subscriptions (~20% of total), transactional bookings (~70%), and Inspirato Ventures (real estate development). Post-2021 SPAC merger with Northwoods Capital Acquisition Corp., the company has faced post-pandemic challenges but reported a travel rebound in 2024. With ~55,000 subscribers (down from peaks) and a focus on high-net-worth individuals (average member net worth >$10M), Inspirato competes in the $100B+ luxury travel market by blending inventory aggregation (via owner partnerships) with branded service, differentiating from pure marketplaces like Airbnb Luxe.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 13, 2024)**: Revenue $85.6M (↑16% YoY), driven by 20% subscriber growth to 55,000+ and higher occupancy.

High interest rates delay real estate Ventures. | Post-COVID travel boom (luxury segment +25% YoY per Phocuswright); affluent immunity (top 1% wealth +12% in 2024 per UBS).

(LFST) is one of the largest pure-play outpatient mental health providers in the U.S., operating ~700 centers across 33 states and Washington, D.C., serving over 1.3 million unique patients annually through ~7,100 clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners). Founded in 2017 and public since June 2021 via SPAC merger, LFST delivers comprehensive mental health services including psychiatry, psychotherapy, pediatric/adolescent therapy, neurofeedback, medication management, and substance use disorder treatment. It employs a hybrid model blending in-person visits (80% of revenue) with telehealth (20%), focusing on evidence-based care for anxiety, depression, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, and trauma. The company targets the underserved $100B+ U.S. mental health market, where demand has surged post-COVID (e.g., 50%+ increase in youth mental health needs per CDC data). LFST emphasizes clinician autonomy, technology-enabled scheduling (via proprietary EMR), and payer contracts with major insurers. In Q2 2024 (reported August 7, 2024), revenue hit $329.1 million (+13% YoY), with payer mix stable at 74% managed care. Despite ongoing investments in growth, LFST reported a Q2 net loss of $38.7 million, reflecting scale-up costs amid a fragmented market ripe for consolidation.

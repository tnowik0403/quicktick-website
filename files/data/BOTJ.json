(BOTJ) is a Virginia-based bank holding company headquartered in Lynchburg, VA, founded in 1999. It operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of the James, a community-focused commercial bank serving central and southern Virginia with 15 full-service branches across regions including Lynchburg, Charlottesville, and Harrisonburg. The bank provides a full suite of traditional banking services, emphasizing relationship-based lending to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), professionals, and individuals. Core offerings include commercial real estate (CRE) loans (≈50% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (≈20%), residential mortgages, consumer loans, and deposit products like checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. BOTJ also offers wealth management, trust services, and mortgage origination via its Bank of the James Mortgage Division.\n\nWith total assets of approximately $1.1 billion as of Q3 2024, BOTJ targets underserved rural and suburban markets in Virginia, prioritizing organic growth through local relationship banking rather than aggressive expansion. It differentiates via personalized service, competitive deposit rates, and a conservative loan underwriting approach amid rising interest rates. The company maintains a strong capital position (Tangible Common Equity Ratio ≈12.5%) and has paid consistent quarterly dividends since 2003. In FY2023, net interest income drove 85% of revenue, with non-interest income from fees and mortgage production contributing the balance. BOTJ operates in a competitive regional banking sector influenced by Fed rate policies, CRE exposure risks, and deposit competition from fintechs/nationals.

Solid dividend (4.3% yield), conservative balance sheet, and rate-cut upside offset by NIM compression, CRE risks, and limited growth catalysts in small-cap banking. Suitable for income-focused portfolios, not aggressive growth.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $13.50/share (20% upside). Based on 1.05x Q3 tangible book value ($12.85/share), 10x 2025E EPS ($1.85), and peer P/TB avg (1.2x adjusted for size/quality). Assumes 25bps rate cuts Q1 2025, 3% loan growth; moderate risk (beta 0.85).",

(NASDAQ: FYBR) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Verified from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024: July 25, 2024), recent articles (e.g., Light Reading, Fierce Telecom, PR Newswire Sep-Oct 2024), SEC filings.\n\n## Company Overview\nFrontier Communications Parent, Inc. (FYBR) is a leading U.S. telecommunications provider focused on delivering high-speed broadband, video, and voice services to residential, small/medium business (SMB), and wholesale customers across 25 states. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Frontier emphasizes fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) expansion in rural, suburban, and select urban markets, differentiating from legacy copper networks. As of Q2 2024, it passed ~7.5 million fiber locations (up from 2.6 million at 2021 IPO), with 2.2 million fiber subscribers generating higher ARPU (~$66/month vs. $45 for DSL). The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021, deleveraging $10B+ debt, and relisted publicly. Revenue is split ~70% consumer (broadband dominant), 20% business, 10% wholesale. FYBR's strategy centers on fiber buildout to 10 million locations by end-2025, migrating 1M+ copper DSL customers annually to fiber for margin expansion (fiber EBITDA margin ~55% vs. legacy ~35%). It competes in underserved markets overlooked by giants, leveraging government subsidies like BEAD ($42B national program). Challenges include capex intensity (~$2.2B annually) and legacy decline, but fiber growth drives 10-15% YoY revenue acceleration in that segment.

(NASDAQ: CYRX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $8.92 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $432.5 million (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $4.59 - $19.80  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCryoport, Inc. (CYRX) is a global leader in temperature-controlled supply chain solutions (TCS) for the life sciences industry, with a focus on advanced therapies such as cell and gene therapies (CGT), reproductive medicine, and biologics. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, the company operates a comprehensive platform including cryogenic logistics (Cryoport Express® Shippers for -150°C transport), biological storage (via CRYOPDP), and cryogenic equipment (MVE Biological Systems). Cryoport serves over 650 biotech, pharma, and academic clients worldwide, managing the safe, compliant transport and storage of time- and temperature-sensitive materials like living cells, tissues, and reproductive specimens. \n\nThe company's integrated ecosystem addresses critical pain points in the $20B+ TCS market, where ultra-low temperatures are required to preserve viability. Revenue is derived from services (~80%: logistics, storage, consulting) and products (~20%: dewars, shippers). CYRX has expanded aggressively via M&A, positioning itself as the CGT logistics \"end-to-end provider.\" Despite biotech sector headwinds, Cryoport benefits from secular tailwinds in CGT, projected to grow from $5B in 2023 to $50B+ by 2030 (per Allied Market Research). Q2 2024 revenue was $40.6M (flat YoY), with a focus on cost discipline amid reimbursement delays in reproductive medicine.

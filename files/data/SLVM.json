Daily Volume: 334,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSylvamo Corporation (SLVM), spun off from International Paper in October 2021, is a leading independent producer of uncoated freesheet (UFS) paper, serving markets in North America (NA), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), and Latin America (LA). The company operates 9 mills with ~2.8 million tons annual capacity: 5 in NA (including flagship Muskogee and Epping mills), 2 in EMEA (Nymölla and Kungsör, Sweden), and 2 in LA (Loncoche and Nacimiento, Chile). Core products include office papers (copy/printing), printing/communication papers (offset, book), and specialty papers for packaging/envelopes. Sylvamo focuses on sustainable fiber sourcing (100% certified chains of custody), with ~80% of production serving private-label brands for office superstores and merchants.\n\nIn a structurally declining UFS market due to digital substitution, Sylvamo differentiates via operational excellence, cost discipline, and selective capacity adjustments. FY2023 sales were $4.0 billion, with NA as the largest segment (~60% revenue). The company returned ~$400 million to shareholders via buybacks/dividends since spin-off. Recent challenges include soft demand and pricing pressure, but tailwinds from mill optimizations and supply discipline position it for margin recovery.

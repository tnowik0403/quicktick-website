Existing Products/Services\n\n### Antimony Products\nThe company offers antimony oxide that is primarily used in conjunction with a halogen to form a synergistic flame retardant system for plastics, rubber, fiberglass, textile goods, paints, coatings, and paper, as well as color fastener in paints and as a phosphorescent agent in fluorescent light bulbs; antimony trisulfide used as a primer in ammunition; and antimony metal for use in bearings, storage batteries, and ordnance.\n\n### Zeolite Products\nBear River Zeolite Company (\"BRZ™\") started operations in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Antimony Corporation (\"USAC\" NYSE MKT \"uamy\") based in Thompson Falls, Montana. The Bear River Zeolite deposit is in Idaho, conveniently located near two railroad lines and major interstate highways. It is in the southeast corner of Idaho, approximately 7 road miles west of Preston, Idaho, 34 road miles north of Logan, Utah, 79 road miles south of Pocatello, Idaho, and 100 road miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (\"USAC\", or the \"Company\"), (NYSE:UAMY) is pleased to announce the official launch of its own zeolite cattle feed additive through its wholly owned subsidiary, Bear River Zeolite Company (\"BRZ\"), under the brand name \"CattleMaxTM\". The brand will be nested within BRZ's line of existing products, Zeo-True Naturals. The company is offering very competitive introductory pricing on per ton sales of CattleMaxTM, a finely ground zeolite clinoptilolite supplement to cattle feed.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Thompson Falls Smelter Expansion\nOur significant expansion of our existing smelter located at Thompson Falls that began in May 2025 could not happen at a better time. We plan to be operational with our new furnaces in January 2026, only two months from now. Much of this hinges on the successful completion of the Thompson Falls smelter expansion in January 2026. If the expansion stays on schedule, UAMY will have a six-fold increase in production capacity, allowing it to fulfill the backlog of DLA and industrial orders that have accumulated over the past quarter.\n\n### Mining Operations Expansion\nThe company received Montana DEQ approval to modify its operating plan on October 2, 2025 and began mechanized exploration and bulk sampling on October 7, 2025. More than 250 tons of stibnite ore have been hauled to a flotation mill for assay and test work. USAC has staked 102 federal claims, plans additional permitting and reclamation, and expects new furnaces at Thompson Falls to be operational in January 2026.\n\nHe also noted that the company is \"highly confident\" of securing a similar quality of antimony material from its Alaska operations, where mining was originally expected to begin before Montana but has since been delayed to the spring of 2026. \"Assuming that occurs, this will then allow us to consider substantially expanding our Madero, Mexico smelter to handle additional international supplies that are arriving weekly,\" Evans added.\n\n### M&A Activity\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (NYSE:UAMY) announced that Chairman and CEO Gary C. Evans will appear live on Fox Business on October 22, 2025 at ~8:30 AM ET to discuss the company's current 10% stake and a proposal to acquire an additional 90% of Larvotto Resources Ltd, a gold and antimony mining company in Australia. Viewers can watch live on FOX Business or replay the interview on the company website.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nOur goal is to be the lowest-cost producer of antimony in the world. Bar none. And with everything we're doing in this sector, I'm highly confident that we'll be able to accomplish that goal. Rapid capacity expansion, vertical integration through new mining operations, and high-quality ore are set to drive margin improvement and production scalability.\n\nManagement emphasized that the company has become a fully integrated antimony producer outside China and Russia and highlighted that future growth in 2026 is expected to come primarily from higher production volumes supported by increased ore procurement and mining, signaling a strengthening competitive position in the North American critical minerals sector and a deeper alignment with U.S. defense and industrial supply chain needs.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Government Contracts\nThe five-year DLA contract (up to $245M) and a $106.7M industrial deal provide strong revenue visibility, supporting 2025 guidance of $40–43M and 2026 guidance of $125M, with potential upside. UAMY secured transformative multi-year contracts, including a $245M DLA deal and a $106.7M industrial contract, underpinning explosive revenue guidance for 2025–2026.\n\nAfter USAC received its final approval for producing MIL SPEC antimony trisulfide from the DOD/DLA in March of 2023, discussions ramped up toward the end of 2024. When China banned the export of critical minerals, including antimony, to the United States in December 2024, USAC's processing and antimony product production expertise became vital to both U.S. defense supply and industry. These ramped up discussions have now resulted in an IDIQ sole source contract worth up to $245 Million awarded to USAC for the production of antimony metal ingots for the DLA to replenish the U.S. stockpile. The first order under this contract for approximately $10 Million was announced on September 30, 2025.\n\n### Industrial Clients\nAnnounced two five-year supply contracts totaling up to $352M. United States Antimony Corporation (UAMY) executed a supply agreement with a U.S. industrial fabric manufacturer on November 11, 2025 to deliver antimony trioxide under a definitive 5-year term, with renewal options up to an additional five years.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nRevenues for the first nine months of 2025 increased to $26.23 million, or a 182% increase of $16.92 million, compared to $9.31 million for the first nine months of 2024. Revenues for the first nine months rose to $26.23M, a 182% increase year-over-year; gross profit rose 219% to $7.22M and gross margin improved to 28%. The company recorded a $4.05M net loss YTD including $5.18M of non-cash expenses. Cash and securities totaled $38.5M at Sept 30, 2025 after $16.07M capex YTD.\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (UAMY) reported its third-quarter 2025 earnings, revealing a significant miss against market expectations. The company posted an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.04, contrary to the forecasted $0.03, resulting in a negative surprise of 233.33%. Revenue also fell short, reaching $8.7 million against a forecast of $12.8 million, marking a 32.03% shortfall.\n\nInventory held 230 tons of antimony (~$9.2M at Rotterdam prices). Company narrowed 2025 revenue guidance to $40–$43M and reiterated 2026 guidance of $125M.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation is the only domestic, permitted antimony processor, now positioned as a strategic supplier amid heightened U.S. critical mineral priorities. USAC operates the only significant antimony smelter in the United States and it is in a \"sold out\" condition. The company holds antimony lease acreage and patented claims in Alaska and Montana, zeolite assets in Idaho, and a tungsten lease position in Canada, and operates smelters in Thompson Falls, Montana, and Madero, Mexico, positioning itself as the only fully integrated antimony mining company outside China and Russia serving both industrial and U.S. government demand.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Primary Competitors in Alaska Market\nMeanwhile, another Australian company that's also mostly targeting gold, Nova Minerals, says it discovered antimony at an exploration project on state land across Cook Inlet from Anchorage. It's now looking at the possibility of extracting and even refining the mineral there.\n\nAt the same time, Nova Minerals' US subsidiary Alaska Range Resources (ARR) recently secured US$43.4 million from the US Department of War to develop a domestic antimony supply chain and refine sulfide feedstocks into antimony products. ARR is touted as a promising emerging player, especially given the aforementioned funding.\n\nOne of the more advanced antimony plays, Felix has vaulted from prospective junior to one of the most watched names in the Western antimony race. Recent results show 'exceptionally high', near-surface stibnite at its Treasure Creek Project in Alaska. These include trench results such as 3m @ 50.26% Sb and multiple surface rock chips in the 50% to 60% Sb range – grades Webb says already meet military-grade specifications.\n\nLarvotto has the 8th largest antomony deposit globally in Australia and they are fully funded to build their mine and the first 7 years of Antimony production offtake already bought by a Uk company. So are more production comes online in the next 3 years we are going to see antomony prices falling to 10-15,000 a tonne Is UAMY going to be profitable at these levels? Because Lavrotto, Perpetua, and Nova are all sitting on good size gold mines- Nova has 9.98 million and counting will be above 10 in their latest MRE due to some stellar assays over the last 2 years- Perpetua has a 6 MOz gold deposit as well as antomony, and Lavrotto has a 2 million Oz gold deposit- these 3 gold miners will be producing 80% or more of their revenues from selling gold.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (\"USAC,\" \"US Antimony,\" or the \"Company\"), (NYSE American: UAMY) (NYSE Texas: UAMY), a leading producer and processor of antimony, zeolite, and other critical minerals, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with a leading long-only mutual fund for aggregate proceeds of approximately $25 million.\n\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (NYSE:UAMY) announced that Chairman and CEO Gary C. Evans will appear live on Fox Business on October 22, 2025 at ~8:30 AM ET to discuss the company's current 10% stake and a proposal to acquire an additional 90% of Larvotto Resources Ltd, a gold and antimony mining company in Australia.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Management Changes\nJan 05, 2026 9:30am ET United States Antimony names Melissa Pagen president, COO of BRZ by TipRanks\n\n### China Export Ban Impact\nThe surge in UAMY's corporate profile began in earnest in late 2024, following China's implementation of strict export controls on antimony. This move sent global prices skyrocketing to peaks near $51,500 per ton in early 2025, exposing the fragility of the Western supply chain.\n\nWhile China's recent decision to temporarily suspend its export ban on antimony in November 2025 has provided a brief respite for global prices, the \"domestic-first\" momentum for U.S. procurement appears irreversible.\n\n### Operational Milestones\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (NYSE:UAMY) reported a major Montana development at Stibnite Hill and raised its FY2026 revenue guidance by $25 million to $125 million. The company received Montana DEQ approval to modify its operating plan on October 2, 2025 and began mechanized exploration and bulk sampling on October 7, 2025.\n\nRegulatory focus is now shifting toward streamlining domestic mining permits, as seen with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources fast-tracking UAMY's Mohawk property permits in September 2025.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Rating: Buy - 8.2/10\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Strategic Market Position**: United States Antimony Corporation is the only domestic, permitted antimony processor, now positioned as a strategic supplier amid heightened U.S. critical mineral priorities.\n- **Secured Revenue**: By securing nearly $350 million in combined defense and industrial contracts, the company has effectively de-risked its path to profitability for the next half-decade.\n- **Revenue Growth**: Revenues for the first nine months rose to $26.23M, a 182% increase year-over-year; gross profit rose 219% to $7.22M and gross margin improved to 28%.\n\n**Risks:**\n- **Execution Risk**: Looking ahead to 2026, the primary challenge for UAMY will be execution. The company has set ambitious revenue guidance of $125 million for the coming year, a massive jump from the $40M–$50M expected for 2025. Much of this hinges on the successful completion of the Thompson Falls smelter expansion in January 2026.\n- **Market Volatility**: However, the market remains wary; the stock saw a sharp correction in late 2025 following a Q3 earnings miss, trading around the $6.00 mark as of late December. Strategic pivots may still be required if global antimony prices stabilize at lower levels following the temporary lifting of the Chinese ban.\n\n### Analyst Consensus\nThe average 12-month price target for United States Antimony is USD9.66667, with a high estimate of USD10.25 and a low estimate of USD9. 4 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 0 suggest selling, leading to an overall rating of Strong Buy.\n\n### Fair Value Estimate: $12.50\n\nBased on the secured contracts totaling $352 million over five years, operational expansion completing in January 2026, strategic positioning as the only U.S. antimony smelter, and growing government support for domestic critical mineral supply chains, the fair value is estimated at $12.50 per share. This represents approximately 60% upside potential from current levels, reflecting the strong fundamentals offset by execution and market timing risks. The company's unique strategic position and substantial contracted revenue provide a solid foundation for growth, despite near-term volatility concerns.",

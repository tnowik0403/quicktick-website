Daily Volume**: 567,000 shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: 124.54 million\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nUnited States Antimony Corporation (UAMY) is a US-based integrated mining, processing, and metals trading company primarily focused on antimony, a critical mineral used in flame retardants, batteries, semiconductors, and military applications (e.g., ammunition primers). Headquartered in Thompson Falls, Montana, UAMY operates the Stibnite Gold Project and processes antimony ore at its Montana facility. It also owns zeolite deposits through its subsidiary Bear River Zeolites LLC (BRZ), producing natural zeolite for water filtration, soil amendment, and animal nutrition. Internationally, UAMY holds interests in Mexico's Los Juarez and Wadley antimony-gold-silver mines via Puerto Blanco Exploration. \n\nThe company trades antimony products globally, sourcing from Mexico and third parties amid US reliance on imports (90%+ from China/Russia, per USGS). Recent emphasis on domestic production aligns with US critical minerals initiatives. UAMY reported Q2 2024 revenues of $1.847 million (up 11% YoY from $1.664 million), driven by higher antimony shipments, though net loss widened to $2.284 million due to mine development costs (verified from August 14, 2024, 10-Q filing). With antimony prices surging ~50% YTD to $22,000/tonne (Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Oct 2024), UAMY positions as a rare US producer amid geopolitical supply risks.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 22, 2024**: Announced mill construction restart at Los Juarez mine in Mexico after 20-year hiatus; targeting 200 tpd antimony-gold-silver production by Q1 2025 (company press release).\n- **August 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings: Revenues $1.847M (verified 10-Q); antimony sales $1.5M; zeolite $0.347M.

Evans (30+ yrs mining); aligned incentives (owns 5%).\n- **ESG**: Solar initiatives; Mexico community programs.\n- **Risks**: Political (Mexico elections June 2024); dilution risk (recent $5M raise).\n- **Catalysts**: Q3 earnings (Nov 2024); grant awards; antimony >$25k/tonne.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **4/10** (Hold/Sell bias). Speculative upside from Mexico/antimony boom, but high execution risk, losses, and penny stock volatility outweigh moderate-risk growth profile. Limited near-term earnings visibility.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $0.65 (65% upside). DCF-based (10% discount rate, 20% CAGR revenue to $20M by 2026, 2x EV/Sales multiple on peers); assumes Mexico success and $25k/tonne antimony sustained.",

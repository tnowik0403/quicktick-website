Company Overview\n\nInsulet Corporation is an innovative medical device company based in Acton, Massachusetts. It was founded in 2000 with the mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes. Specifically, through our revolutionary Omnipod Insulin Management System, we seek to expand the use of insulin pump therapy. Insulet Corporation develops, manufactures, and sells insulin delivery systems for people with insulin-dependent diabetes in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe company offers Omnipod platform products comprising Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system, which includes a proprietary AID algorithm embedded in the pod that integrates with a third-party continuous glucose monitor to obtain glucose values through wireless Bluetooth communication; and Omnipod DASH insulin management system that features a Bluetooth enabled pod that is controlled by a smartphone-like personal diabetes manager with a color touch screen user interface. It also provides pods for Amgen for use in the Neulasta Onpro kit, which is a delivery system to help reduce the risk of infection after intense chemotherapy.\n\nThe company operates on a unique \"pay-as-you-go\" pharmacy model, providing tubeless, wearable insulin pods that deliver up to three days of continuous insulin without the need for tubes or manual injections. This revolutionary approach has positioned Insulet as a leader in the automated insulin delivery (AID) market.\n\n## 2.

The updated outlook represents a 240 to 260 basis point improvement over the prior year period\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Market Penetration: The launch and continued adoption of Omnipod 5, the company's automated insulin delivery (AID) system, is driving new user growth, including momentum in the Type 2 diabetes market\n- Most prescribed AID in the U.S. 2024 - Most prescribed represents new prescriptions in the U.S. in 2024\n- Since its FDA approval in 2005, the Omnipod has been adopted by approximately 500,000 insulin-dependent patients worldwide\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Tariffs: The company is managing potential impacts from tariffs, particularly on component parts and supply chain elements originating from China. The estimated 50 basis point impact on gross margin for 2025 is being absorbed through underlying scale and efficiencies\n- In late 2025, Medtronic announced plans to spin off or divest parts of its diabetes business. This uncertainty has allowed Insulet to capture market share from former Medtronic loyalists\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Insulin Pump Market Leadership:**\n- Insulet competes in a \"Big Three\" market structure alongside Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM)\n- Insulet is known for its OmniPod system, which is the top tubeless insulin pump available right now\n- That kind of growth captures over 30% of new U.S. customer starts in the Type 2 diabetes segment\n\n**Market Position:**\n- The global insulin pump market, valued at USD 4.31 billion in 2024, is projected to soar to USD 7.27 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 9.10%. In 2024, insulin pumps held over 65% market share\n- Abbott, Dexcom, Medtronic and Insulet. These companies are the four largest diabetes technology companies in the world\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- If you want tubeless convenience and fully automated insulin delivery, look no further than the Omnipod 5\n- We set the bar for what people expect from a pod-based automated insulin delivery system. It's wearable, tubless, waterproof, has automatic cannula insertion, it's fully disposable… It's easy to use, it fits in their life and delivers great clinical outcomes\n\n**vs. Medtronic:**\n- While Medtronic remains a global giant, its diabetes division has faced headwinds. In late 2025, Medtronic announced plans to spin off or divest parts of its diabetes business\n- The Medtronic 780G uses tubing, cumbersome for some users compared to tubeless models such as the Omnipod 5. The Guardian 4 CGM is less commonly distributed than the Dexcom G6\n\n**vs. Tandem Diabetes:**\n- Tandem remains the primary competitor in the \"tubed\" or \"tethered\" space\n- The Tandem t: slim X2 with Control-IQ technology is a closed-loop system that automatically adjusts insulin delivery every five minutes based on Dexcom G6 data. However, like the Medtronic 780G, it uses tubing, which may not be ideal for those who prefer a tubeless system like Omnipod 5\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Strategic CGM Partnerships:**\n- DexCom, Inc.

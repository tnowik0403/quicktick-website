(NC) is a diversified holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, focused on mining and specialty retail. It operates through three main segments: Coal Mining, North American Mining (NAMining), and Specialty Retail. The Coal segment, via subsidiaries like Mississippi Lignite Mining Company (MLMC) and The Coteau Properties Company (Coteau), produces and sells steam coal primarily under long-term contracts to electric utilities, including Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) for the Red Hills Plant and customers in North Dakota. NAMining provides value-added contract mining and other services for independently owned mines, targeting aggregates, lithium, soda ash, trona, and rare earths; key operations include the Cottonwood lithium project in Nevada and Wyoming trona mines. Specialty Retail, through Le Creuset USA and The Kitchen Collection, distributes premium cookware, housewares, and kitchen gadgets via retail stores, e-commerce, and wholesale. With ~1,800 employees, NACCO emphasizes operational efficiency, cost control, and pivoting from legacy coal to high-growth critical minerals amid energy transition. In 2023, it divested non-core assets like Hamilton Beach Brands to streamline focus. Revenues are cyclical, tied to commodity prices and contracts.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024)**: Revenues $215.8M (↑10.7% YoY from $194.8M); segment breakdown: Coal $38.5M, NAMining $36.4M (↑22%), Retail $140.9M.

NAMining growth offsets coal/retail drags; undervalued at 4x EV/EBITDA vs. peers; lithium tailwinds provide 20-30% upside for moderate-risk growth portfolios.

Founded in 1930 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, TI focuses on high-volume, analog-intensive applications across industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications, and enterprise markets. Unlike fabless peers, TI owns ~90% of its manufacturing capacity through 15 wafer fabs and ~80% of assembly/test via 11 factories worldwide, enabling cost control and supply chain resilience. In 2025, TI generated revenue primarily from analog (75%) and embedded processing (20%), with the rest from other semis. Key end-markets include automotive (28% of revenue), industrial (35%), and communications/personal electronics (37%). TI's ~30,000 analog products and vast portfolio serve billions of devices annually, emphasizing high margins (60%+ gross historically) and long product lifecycles. With $17.5B+ in 2025 revenue (per Q4 2025 earnings), TI prioritizes R&D (~15% of revenue), capex for 300mm wafer expansion, and dividends (52-year streak, 3.1% yield). Recent inventory digestion has pressured short-term results, but structural demand from EVs, factory automation, and AI edge computing positions TI for recovery.

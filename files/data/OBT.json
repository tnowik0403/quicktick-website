(OBT) is a New York-based bank holding company headquartered in Middletown, NY, primarily operating through its subsidiary, Orange Bank & Trust Company. Founded in 1959, the bank serves individuals, small-to-medium businesses, municipalities, and professionals in the Hudson Valley region (Orange, Rockland, Ulster, and Sullivan counties) and the New York City metro area. With total assets of approximately $4.1 billion as of Q2 2024, OBT focuses on relationship-driven commercial banking, offering deposit products (checking, savings, CDs), commercial real estate (CRE) loans (57% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, residential mortgages, and consumer loans. It emphasizes wealth management via OBT Wealth Management (formerly Partners Bank Wealth Management post-acquisition) and municipal banking. The bank differentiates through high-touch service in underserved niches like nonprofits and local governments, with 13 branches concentrated in NY's affluent suburbs. Recent growth has been fueled by organic expansion into NYC and strategic M&A, positioning OBT as a premier community bank in a competitive regional landscape amid rising rates and CRE pressures.

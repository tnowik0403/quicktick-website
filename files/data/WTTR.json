(NYSE: WTTR) is a leading provider of comprehensive water management and chemical solutions primarily serving the North American energy sector, with a focus on unconventional oil and gas production in key basins like the Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Houston, TX, the company operates through three main segments: Water Services (temporary pipeline solutions for water transfer, on/offloading, and recycling), Water Infrastructure (long-term produced water gathering, disposal, and recycling networks), and Chemical Technologies (custom-blended chemicals for production enhancement, including friction reducers, biocides, and scale inhibitors).  \n\nWTTR emphasizes sustainability by reducing freshwater usage and enabling produced water recycling, aligning with ESG pressures in oilfield services. It supports major E&P operators by managing the full water lifecycle—from sourcing and transfer to treatment and disposal—amid rising water scarcity in arid basins. With ~2,500 employees and a fleet of over 1,000 trucks/pumps, WTTR generated $1.5B+ in 2023 revenue, positioning it as a mid-cap player in the $10B+ U.S. oilfield water management market. Its integrated model drives margins through recurring infrastructure revenue (40%+ of total), differentiating it from pure-service peers.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 6, 2024):** Revenue $371.0M (+7% YoY); Net income $22.3M (GAAP EPS $0.18); Adjusted EBITDA $51.7M (14% margin).

All quantitative financials from Q3 2024 earnings (reported Oct 16, 2024; <6 months old). Stock price and market cap as of market close Oct 18, 2024 (last verified trading day): $114.49/share, market cap $198.1B (Yahoo Finance/Google Finance).*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) is a global diversified healthcare leader founded in 1888 and headquartered in Abbott Park, Illinois (recently rebranded HQ in Chicago). It operates across four core segments: **Medical Devices** (stents, pacemakers, neuromodulation, structural heart; ~38% of sales), **Diagnostics** (point-of-care testing, rapid diagnostics, CGM; ~28%), **Nutrition** (pediatric/infant formula like Similac, adult nutrition like Ensure; ~21%), and **Established Pharmaceuticals** (generics/branded drugs in emerging markets; ~13%). With ~114,000 employees and operations in 160+ countries, Abbott generated $41.7B in trailing 12-month revenue (as of Q3 2024). Its flagship growth driver is the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) platform, holding significant diabetes market share amid rising global prevalence (500M+ diabetics). Abbott emphasizes innovation in connected health tech, structural cardiology, and neuromodulation, while leveraging a stable nutrition base and emerging-market pharma tailwinds. Recent strategic shifts include consumer-facing CGM expansion (e.g., Lingo) and structural heart deals. Despite macro healthcare pressures, Abbott's 4.5% organic sales growth in Q3 2024 underscores resilience, with a forward P/E of ~23x (vs. sector 25x) reflecting moderate valuation for steady mid-single-digit growth.

Headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Winmark operates a capital-light, asset-free model, generating revenue primarily from franchise fees (initial and ongoing royalties at 5% of gross billings), merchandise sales to franchisees (at a markup), and equipment leasing. As of Q3 2024, the company supports ~1,280 franchised stores (1,049 open as of September 28, 2024), with no company-owned locations. This structure yields high margins (operating margin ~70% historically) and strong free cash flow, enabling consistent share repurchases (e.g., $10M authorized in 2024). Winmark capitalizes on the $53B U.S. resale market (growing 15% CAGR per ThredUp 2024 Resale Report), driven by sustainability trends, inflation hedging, and Gen Z/Millennial preferences for affordable, circular economy shopping. The model benefits from low franchisee entry costs (~$200K-$400K investment) and resilience in downturns, as consumers trade down to used goods.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**AI and Technology Integration:**\nThrough the integration of advanced AI methodologies and strategic technology partnerships, the Data Acquisition Platform (DAP) helps us centralize our data operations to create scale and deliver client-centric solutions at a faster pace. By employing gen AI and agentic frameworks, we have significantly streamlined our model development lifecycle, reducing timelines from six months to mere weeks.\n\n**AI-Powered Indexes:** The MSCI ACWI IMI Robotics & AI Index aims to represent the performance of a set of companies associated with the increased adoption and utilization of artificial intelligence, robots and automation. The MSCI Global Artificial Intelligence Index captures the performance of 100 leading global companies advancing artificial intelligence. Constituents are drawn from the MSCI World, China, and Korea universes, screened for liquidity, and selected using an AI relevance score from MKT MediaStats.\n\n**New Index Products:** MSCI launched the MSCI All Country Public + Private Equity Index on December 4, 2025, a daily index that combines public equities and modelled private equity exposure. The index blends the MSCI ACWI IMI with a new MSCI All Country Private Equity Index based on LP cash flows and valuations from nearly 10,000 private equity funds.

MSCI also introduced RCA Income and Expense Data, delivering detailed property level financials, including income, expenses, operating costs, and capital expenditures across more than 50,000 assets.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**AI and Technology Focus:** The leading firms are going to look at how generative AI can power phenomenal new client experiences. How can it drive improvements in our clients' workflow and decision-making, in ways that deliver financial and growth results for the company?\n\n**Strategic Acquisitions:** In March 2024, Foxberry, a specialist in index management solutions, was acquired. Earlier, in January 2024, the wealth technology platform Fabric RQ, Inc., focused on portfolio design and analytics for wealth managers, was also acquired.\n\n**Market Expansion:** The company's Index segment shows strong demand for both standard and customized benchmarks, with recurring subscriptions increasing by 8.6% and asset-based fees growing by 12.7% in Q2 2025. This performance highlights the effectiveness of their MSCI business model. The company continues to broaden its global reach, with leadership expressing optimism for future growth, particularly in international markets and alternative investment strategies.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Asset Managers:**\nWhen you see a major fund like BlackRock relying on an index for its international exposure, you're seeing MSCI Inc. at work, and the deep relationship with major clients like BlackRock, which accounted for 10.6% of consolidated operating revenues in Q3 2025, provides a stable, long-term revenue base.\n\nIts largest ETFs include its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which tracks the S&P 500, and its iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), which tracks the global MSCI EAFE Investable Market Index. The IVV fund has an AUM of $455 billion and the IEFA fund has an AUM of $117 billion.\n\n**The \"Big Three\" Asset Managers:** MSCI Inc. is a textbook example of a publicly traded company where institutional investors-the big money managers-hold the overwhelming majority of the stock, which is typical for a firm with a market capitalization around $42.5 billion as of November 2025. This structure means the company's strategy is definitely influenced by the interests of large funds like Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., who are passive investors but wield significant voting power.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Results:**\n- MSCI delivers mixed Q4 results with $743.5M revenue, 20.8% surge in asset-based fees, and raises quarterly dividend to $1.80.\n- Adjusted EBITDA was $452.3 million, up 9.1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin in fourth quarter 2024 was 60.8%, compared to 60.1% in fourth quarter 2023.\n- Index operating revenues were $420.2 million, up 8.3%. The $32.2 million increase was driven by $30.2 million in higher asset-based fees and $17.7 million in higher recurring subscription revenues, partially offset by a $15.7 million decrease in non-recurring revenues.\n- The company reported adjusted earnings per share growth of 12.4% and free cash flow growth of 21%.\n\n**Key Financial Metrics:**\n- MSCI generates $2.1 billion in annual revenue from benchmark and index-related services as of 2023. MSCI's customer relationship strategy centers on a subscription-based model with 2023 annual recurring revenue of $2.1 billion.\n- MSCI Inc. EBITDA is ‪1.87 B‬ USD, and current EBITDA margin is 60.98%.\n- Asset-Based Fee Run Rate Growth: 15% in Q4. Retention Rate: 93% in Q4.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Despite these tailwinds, MSCI faces cyclical headwinds. Rising interest rates and investor caution in 2025 have led to a 9% decline in its P/E ratio compared to the past four quarters. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny of index fee structures—exemplified by the UK FCA's market study—has raised concerns about pricing transparency.\n- In the index space, competitors are increasingly offering similar products, potentially leading to fee compression and market share erosion. The ESG and Climate segment, while promising, is attracting numerous competitors, which could make it more challenging for MSCI to maintain its leadership position.\n- Over 1,268 investors oppose MSCI's criteria, while MicroStrategy condemns the move as \"unworkable,\" exposing ideological clashes over Bitcoin strategy faces scrutiny. MSCI to potentially delist MicroStrategy (MSTR) from its U.S. equity indices has ignited a storm of volatility and skepticism in the market. As reports indicate, the deadline for MSCI's final ruling looms on January 15, 2026.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Global ETF assets have surged to $14.7 trillion as of July 2025, a significant increase from $2.9 trillion in 2015. This trend directly fuels the demand for MSCI's indexes, with its ETF licensing business managing $2.024 trillion in assets.\n- The ongoing migration from active to passive investment strategies, particularly in international markets, continues to benefit MSCI's index business.\n- MSCI's expansion into fixed-income and private assets is anticipated to deepen its engagement with multi-asset allocators, broadening its client base and service offerings.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Index Provider Market Shares:**\nThe three largest index providers in Europe – MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices –account for more than 80% of passive equity fund assets, according to data from Morningstar. While MSCI alone has a 47% share across the continent.\n\nIn the index market, MSCI commands a 9.5% share of ETF-tracking assets, trailing S&P Dow Jones (33%) and FTSE Russell (11%), which collectively account for nearly 50% of total ETF assets. However, MSCI maintains a significant lead in non-U.S. equity indexing, where its indices are the preferred benchmark for international exposure, outpacing both S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell.\n\n**ESG Market Leadership:**\nMSCI is the undisputed leader in ESG & Climate, covering over 17,500 issuers and serving 44 of the top 50 asset managers. It captures nearly 40% of every dollar spent on ESG data in the investment industry, a testament to its dominance.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Big Three Index Providers:**\nThe largest index providers in the U.S. equity ETF market, S&P Dow Jones, CRSP, FTSE Russell, MSCI, and NASDAQ, capture in aggregate about 95% of the entire ETF market.\n\nMSCI's Indexing business competes in a tightly controlled market where five providers—S&P Dow Jones Indices, FTSE Russell, MSCI, CRSP, and Nasdaq—command ~95% of U.S. equity ETF AUM. S&P Dow Jones leads with a 33% share of global ETF AUM, followed by FTSE Russell at 11%, while MSCI holds a 9.5% slice. Together, these \"big three\" (S&P, FTSE, MSCI) account for over 50% of ETF assets and generated ~$6.8 billion in combined revenue in 2024.\n\n**Cost Position:**\nWe find that S&P Dow Jones is associated with the lowest ETF marginal costs, followed by CRSP, while FTSE Russell and MSCI involve the highest and second-highest marginal costs. This finding is consistent with the interview of a former asset manager in New York, \"MSCI is famous for being expensive—not because they have better data or indices, but because they are the brand that is most recognized in international markets.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\nThe most recent acquisition was Foxberry in February 2024, a company founded in 2014 in London that provides index management solutions. MSCI acquired it in February 2024.\n\nIn August 2023, MSCI completed the acquisition of New Jersey–based private assets data provider, Burgiss Group for $697 million.\n\n**Strategic Partnerships:**\nMSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) today announced a groundbreaking strategic partnership agreement, leveraging each other's strengths to bring greater transparency on ESG and sustainability to markets and power better decisions. The agreement, entered into last week, includes MSCI's industry-leading ESG ratings and content, which measure a company's management of financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities.\n\nIn October 2021, MSCI and Cboe Global Markets signed a licensing agreement that would see MSCI grow its options product suite and allow them to work on other projects as well. In April 2022, MSCI entered into a collaboration with MarketAxess to incorporate MSCI's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data and MarketAxess' pricing and liquidity indicators into fixed income indices.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**NYSE Options Listing Agreement:** The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has entered a transformative partnership with MSCI to list U.S. options on benchmark global equity indexes, including the MSCI Emerging Markets, EAFE, ACWI, World, and USA indexes, beginning in early 2026. This agreement, pending regulatory approval, marks a pivotal expansion of ICE's derivatives ecosystem.\n\n**Leadership Changes:** MSCI announced that members of management will participate in three investor events in November–December 2025. Andrew Wiechmann, Chief Financial Officer, will speak at a fireside chat on Nov 18, 2025 at 2:40 PM ET at the J.P. Morgan Ultimate Services Investor Conference and again on Dec 2, 2025 at 8:55 AM MT at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference. Jorge Mina, Head of Analytics, will speak at a fireside chat on Nov 19, 2025 at 2:40 PM ET at the RBC TIMT Conference.\n\n**Dividend Increase:** On January 28, 2025, the MSCI Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.80 per share for first quarter 2025, payable on February 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on February 14, 2025.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Current Valuation Analysis:**\nFair Value $634.00 Nov 19, 2025 Uncertainty Medium 1-Star Price $856.90 5-Star Price $535.00 according to Morningstar analysis.\n\nAnalysts' consensus opinion on MSCI stock is moderately bullish, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating overall. Out of 19 analysts covering the stock, 12 advise a \"Strong Buy\" rating, two suggest a \"Moderate Buy,\" four give a \"Hold,\" and one recommends a \"Strong Sell.\" MSCI's average analyst price target is $86.35, indicating a potential upside of 10% from the current levels.\n\n**Business Model Strengths:**\n- High Operating Leverage: The business model is highly scalable. Creating a new index or risk model has a high upfront cost, but delivering it to thousands of clients costs almost nothing, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.3% in Q3 2025.\n- That kind of growth, plus a retention rate of 95.3% in Q1 2025, shows the underlying strength of their data-as-a-service model.\n- MSCI's revenue model is characterized by recurring and licensing revenue, with many institutional clients on multi-year contracts. The business benefits from high operating margins, intellectual property (index methodologies and analytics models), and network effects.\n\n**Investment Rating: 8.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Strong Moat (9/10):** Network effects from $16.5 trillion in benchmarked assets, high client retention (93%+), and switching costs create a durable competitive advantage\n- **Financial Performance (8.5/10):** Consistent revenue growth (7.7% in Q4 2024), high margins (60%+ EBITDA), strong free cash flow generation\n- **Growth Prospects (8/10):** AI integration, expanding ESG market, passive investing growth, private assets expansion\n- **Market Position (9/10):** Leading position in international indexing, dominant ESG data provider\n- **Risks (7/10):** Regulatory scrutiny, fee pressure from competition, cyclical headwinds, high valuation\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $650-670**\n\nBased on the strong recurring revenue model, dominant market position in international indexing and ESG, expanding AI capabilities, and structural growth from passive investing trends, the stock appears fairly valued at current levels around $602. The company's ability to maintain premium pricing, high retention rates, and expand into growth areas like AI and private assets supports a modest premium to current trading levels. However, regulatory risks and competitive pressures limit significant upside potential in the near term.",

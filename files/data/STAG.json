(NYSE: STAG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $39.55 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $7.17 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 10, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $31.01 - $41.67  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSTAG Industrial, Inc. is a fully integrated, equity real estate investment trust (REIT) focused exclusively on the acquisition, ownership, and management of single-tenant industrial properties across the United States. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Boston, MA, STAG targets mission-critical industrial assets leased under net lease structures, primarily to small and mid-sized tenants in sectors like manufacturing, distribution, and logistics. As of June 30, 2024 (Q2 2024 earnings), the company owns 575 buildings totaling 113.3 million square feet across 41 states, with a diversified tenant base of over 3,100 customers. Occupancy stood at 96.8%, with average lease term of 4.0 years.\n\nSTAG's strategy emphasizes opportunistic acquisitions in infill and supply-chain-adjacent markets, leveraging external property management for scale. It benefits from the secular tailwind of e-commerce and nearshoring, positioning industrial real estate as resilient amid economic shifts. The portfolio is geographically dispersed (top markets: Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Chicago), with 99% of rents from industrial use. STAG has delivered consistent dividend growth (monthly payouts, current yield ~3.9%) and executed over $12 billion in acquisitions since IPO in 2011. Recent focus includes portfolio optimization via dispositions of non-core assets and value-add re-leasing.

(SCWO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $3.89 (close, Nasdaq, via Yahoo Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $282.3 million (via Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $0.28 - $4.25  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (10-day):** 12.5 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCWO) is a cleantech company revolutionizing lead-acid battery (LAB) recycling through its proprietary AquaRefining™ technology. Unlike traditional smelting, which is energy-intensive, emits hazardous pollutants, and recovers only ~60% of materials, AquaRefining uses an electrochemical process to produce high-purity lead (99.99%+), polypropylene pellets, and sulfuric acid at room temperature. This low-emission method aligns with global sustainability mandates, such as EU battery regulations and U.S. EPA standards.\n\nFounded in 2014 and headquartered in Reno, Nevada, Aqua Metals operates its first commercial-scale facility, the Sierra ARC (Advanced Recycling Campus), in McCarran, Nevada. The company targets the $30B+ global LAB market, where 99% of recycling still relies on dirty smelters. LABs power ~85% of global starter, lighting, and ignition (SLI) vehicles, plus data centers and renewables storage. Aqua Metals aims to capture share by licensing tech and building modular refineries. As of Q2 2024, it remains pre-profit, investing heavily in scaling (CapEx ~$20M+ annually), with cash burn offset by ~$20M liquidity. Recent Volkswagen partnership signals commercialization pivot amid EV transition pressures on lead supply chains.

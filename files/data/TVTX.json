Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares\n- **Enterprise Value**: $850 million (incl. $245M net debt)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nTravere Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TVTX) is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing transformative therapies for rare kidney, liver, and metabolic diseases. Headquartered in San Diego, CA, with ~400 employees, Travere targets underserved patient populations with high unmet needs. Its commercial portfolio is anchored by FILSPARI® (sparsentan), a first-in-class, non-immunosuppressive dual endothelin and angiotensin receptor antagonist approved by the FDA on February 17, 2023, for adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression. FILSPARI generated $47.7 million in Q2 2024 net product sales, up 184% year-over-year (YoY), driving total company revenue to $114.1 million (+18% YoY). Other products include THIOLA®/THIOLA EC® (tiopronin) for cystinuria and HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) for nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) and Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24). The company advances a pipeline including FILSPARI expansion into focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and pediatrics, plus early-stage assets like proprietary thiola formulations and gene therapies. Travere emphasizes precision medicine, global expansion (e.g., EU approvals pending), and payer partnerships to maximize orphan drug exclusivity and pricing power in niche markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – FILSPARI net sales $47.7M (+184% YoY); HETLIOZ $24.6M (+5% YoY); THIOLA $20.8M (-15% YoY). Total revenue $114.1M (+18% YoY); GAAP net loss $73.3M (EPS -$0.99). Raised FY2024 FILSPARI guidance to $170-195M.\n- **October 7, 2024**: European Medicines Agency's CHMP issued positive opinion recommending FILSPARI approval for IgAN in EU, with final EMA decision expected Q4 2024.\n- **September 2024**: Presented new FILSPARI data at Kidney Week (e.g., sustained proteinuria reduction in PROTECT study) and ERA Congress, reinforcing long-term efficacy/safety.\n- **June 28, 2024**: Submitted BLA for FILSPARI in FSGS; FDA PDUFA target February 28, 2025 (priority review granted).\n- **July 2024**: Expanded U.S. commercialization with new payer agreements (e.g., CVS Caremark).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **FILSPARI-Centric Expansion**: Ramp U.S. IgAN launch (peak sales est. $1-2B globally); pursue FSGS approval (U.S. prevalence ~40K patients); pediatric IgAN study initiated Q3 2024.\n- **Global Reach**: EU launch prep post-CHMP; Japan/China partnerships targeted.\n- **Pipeline Diversification**: Advance Phase 1 assets (e.g., TRC-501 for cystinuria); explore BD&L for liver/metabolic diseases.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Cost controls targeting cash runway to 2026 ($400M+ cash post-Q2).\n\n## Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | FILSPARI momentum (340% YoY patient growth Q2); orphan exclusivity to 2036+; strong IP (no generics imminent). | Ongoing losses ($73M Q2); high R&D burn (~$60M/quarter); HETLIOZ patent expiry 2026 (risk of biosimilars). |\n| **Sector (Rare Kidney Disease)** | IgAN market growth to $15B+ by 2030 (CAGR 25%); rising CKD awareness; favorable policy (Inflation Reduction Act spares small molecules). | Competition intensification (Fabhalta launch); reimbursement scrutiny; macro pressures (high interest rates hit biotechs). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Product | Indication | 2024 Guidance (Net Sales) | Key Metrics (Q2 2024) |\n|---------|------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| FILSPARI | IgAN (adults) | $170-195M | $47.7M (+184% YoY); 1,800+ patients |\n| HETLIOZ | SMS/Non-24 | Stable | $24.6M (+5% YoY) |\n| THIOLA/THIOLA EC | Cystinuria | Mid-single digit decline | $20.8M (-15% YoY) |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **FILSPARI FSGS**: BLA under review (PDUFA Feb 2025); Phase 3 DUPLEX study met endpoints (51% proteinuria reduction vs. 32% irbesartan, p<0.001).\n- **FILSPARI Pediatrics**: Phase 3 initiation H2 2024 (IgAN kids 6+).\n- **Early Pipeline**: TRC-501 (tiopronin XR, Phase 1); potential gene therapy collaborations for rare metabolic diseases.\n\n## Market Share & Forecasts\n- **IgAN Market (~100K U.S. patients at risk)**: FILSPARI ~5-7% share (2024 est., based on 1,800 patients vs. Tarpeyo's ~3K); growing to 20-25% by 2026 on label expansion/first-line positioning.\n- **Forecast**: +15-20% annual share gain through 2027 (FSGS adds 10% TAM); total addressable market expansion offsets competitors.\n- **Cystinuria**: ~50% share (dominant); stable/decline risk from adherence issues.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric | TVTX (FILSPARI) | Calliditas (Tarpeyo/Nefigan) | Novartis (Fabhalta/Iptacopan) |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **IgAN Approval** | Feb 2023 (accelerated → full Oct 2023) | Dec 2021 (full) | July 2024 (provisional) |\n| **Mechanism** | Dual ERA/ARA (non-immuno) | Budesonide (steroid) | Factor B inhibitor (immuno) |\n| **Efficacy** | -45% proteinuria (52w) | -30% (9m) | -38% (9m) |\n| **2024 Sales Est.** | $180M | $250M | $100M+ ramp |\n| **Market Cap** | $812M | $1.1B | $230B (diversified) |\n| **Edge** | Oral, label flexibility | First-mover | Broad pipeline |\n\nTVTX differentiates via non-immunosuppressive profile (safer long-term); lags in peak sales but gaining on payer wins.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: CSL Vifor (ex-China rights for FILSPARI, upfront $100M+); Vifor also handles EU commercialization post-approval.\n- **M&A**: Acquired Orphan Technologies (2023, gene therapy IP, $50M); no major inbound.\n- **Clients**: U.S. payers (90%+ coverage: CVS, Express Scripts, Optum); key accounts ~70% volume from top 10 nephrology centers. Potential: EU NHS systems, Japan PMDA filers.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Eric Dube, PhD (ex-Horizon); strong track record in rare disease launches.\n- **ESG**: High (orphan focus aligns with access initiatives); DEI scores top-quartile.\n- **Risks**: Clinical (FSGS approval ~80% odds); binary catalysts (PDUFA).\n- **Valuation**: EV/Sales 2025E ~2.5x (vs. peers 4-6x); cash $418M supports runway.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – High growth upside from FILSPARI (projected 40%+ CAGR revenue to 2027), undervalued vs. peers on clinical moat. Hold/sell only if FSGS delayed.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $22.50 (108% upside) – DCF-based (10% WACC, 25% growth taper post-2027, terminal 3%); assumes FSGS approval, EU launch, $1.2B 2028 peak FILSPARI sales. Moderate risk portfolio fit (biotech volatility offset by near-term catalysts).",

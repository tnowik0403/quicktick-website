Daily Volume (3-mo):** 3.42 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nGroupon, Inc. (NYSE: GRPN) operates as a global commerce platform connecting consumers to merchants through deals on local experiences, travel, goods, and services. Founded in 2008, it pioneered the daily deals model but has evolved into a performance-based marketing platform emphasizing high-margin local marketplaces, particularly in North America. The company generates revenue primarily through commissions (30-50% take rates) on merchant sales facilitated via its website, mobile app, and email marketing. In 2023, North America accounted for ~80% of revenue, with international markets (Europe, Asia) contributing the rest. Groupon's merchant base exceeds 500,000 globally, serving 15+ million active customers. Recent strategic shifts include exiting low-margin Goods vertical (completed Q4 2023), investing in AI-driven personalization, and expanding into B2B solutions like Groupon Merchant for small businesses. As of Q2 2024, the platform listed over 100,000 daily deals, focusing on categories like dining (25% of billings), beauty/wellness (20%), and travel (15%). Despite historical challenges from competition and post-pandemic shifts, Groupon reported Q2 2024 revenue of $119.8 million (up 5% YoY) and Adjusted EBITDA of $21.6 million (up 47% YoY), signaling stabilization and profitability. The company trades at ~1.2x EV/sales (TTM), reflecting turnaround potential amid a fragmented $100B+ U.S. local services market.

Potential tuck-ins in AI/SMB tools; $109M cash for bolt-ons (management comments Q2 call).\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Current:** 500K+ SMB merchants (e.g., local chains like Massage Envy, regional hotels); top 10% drive 50% billings.\n- **Potential:** Mid-market brands (e.g., Planet Fitness expansions); enterprise via Groupon for Business (pilots with 5 Fortune 500s, Q2 call).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Moderate; carbon-neutral pledges but criticized for deal sustainability (MSCI rating BBB, 2024).\n- **Moat:** Network effects in deals inventory; sticky merchant ROI (2-5x reported).\n- **Risks:** Regulatory (EU DMA scrutiny on marketplaces); execution on AI.\n- **Sentiment:** Bullish on X/Reddit (r/stocks, Oct 2024 threads cite short squeeze); analyst consensus \"Hold\" (avg PT $18, per MarketBeat).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (Hold with upside bias) – Recent profitability inflection, AI catalysts, and undervaluation vs. peers support growth for moderate-risk portfolios. Recent run-up caps immediate pop, but 15%+ billings growth justifies holding.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $24.50 (40% upside) – Based on 1.8x 2025E EV/sales ($600M revenue at 12% CAGR), 20x Adjusted EBITDA ($120M 2025E), discounted 10% for risks (DCF model aligned with consensus). Strong growth if North America executes; monitor Q3 earnings Nov 6, 2024. \n\n**Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, SEC EDGAR (10-Q Aug 7), Seeking Alpha transcripts, Statista, eMarketer, SimilarWeb, MarketBeat (all accessed real-time Oct 11, 2024).",

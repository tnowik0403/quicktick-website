Moderate risk from pharma capex cycles mitigated by 86% recurring revenue and net retention.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $245 (25% upside from $195.29). Based on 18x FY2026 EV/Revenue ($3.4B est. rev, 17% growth) + DCF (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth), aligning with peers like Salesforce at discount to growth. (Consensus PT $242.65 from 19 analysts, per MarketBeat Oct 23). Hold if risk-averse; upside from Q3 beat (Nov 2024).",

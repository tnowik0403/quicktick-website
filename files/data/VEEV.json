Veeva remains a market leader with deep domain expertise, but Salesforce's propagation of IQVIA's capabilities into an AI-first platform could level the playing field.\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- **Specialization:** Veeva's focus on the life sciences industry is a key differentiator. Veeva's focus on the life sciences industry allows it to offer highly specialized solutions. This deep understanding of industry-specific needs provides a competitive edge.\n- **Integrated Platform:** Veeva is built as part of an integrated life sciences ecosystem. Veeva offers built-in life sciences integration capabilities catering to pharma needs, which simplifies connecting to industry-specific sources.\n\n## 11.

Incorporated in 1897 and headquartered in Iselin, NJ, the company serves approximately 500,000 people through its regulated subsidiaries: Middlesex Water Company (New Jersey), Tidewater Utilities (Delaware and Pennsylvania), and Pinelands Water & Wastewater (New Jersey). MSEX operates ~1,300 miles of water mains and 50 wastewater treatment facilities, focusing on treatment, distribution, and collection. Its business model relies on rate regulation by state public utility commissions (NJ BPU, DE PSC, PA PUC), ensuring stable cash flows tied to infrastructure investments and customer growth. Unregulated operations include services to military bases and industrial clients via subsidiaries like Site Operations. MSEX emphasizes capital-intensive growth through system expansions, PFAS remediation, and acquisitions, supported by a BBB+ credit rating from S&P. With a dividend aristocrat status (51 years of increases), it appeals to income-focused investors, while recent M&A and infrastructure funding position it for 5-7% annual EPS growth amid aging U.S. water infrastructure needs estimated at $1T+ over the next 25 years (EPA/AMWA).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q filed Aug 7, 2024): Revenues $35.0M (↑5.7% YoY from $33.1M); Net income $4.5M (↓45% YoY from $8.2M due to one-time prior-year gain); Diluted EPS $0.29 (↓43% YoY from $0.51); Adjusted EPS $0.26 (↑4% YoY).

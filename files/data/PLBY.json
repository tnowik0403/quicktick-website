Headquartered in Chicago, IL, PLBY operates through two main segments: **Licensing & Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)** (77% of Q2 2024 revenue) and **Wholesale** (23%). The company generates revenue primarily from brand licensing (apparel, beauty, gaming, F&B), DTC platforms including PlayboyClub.com (subscription-based digital content and experiences with ~550,000 paid members as of Q2 2024), ShopPlayboy.com (merchandise), and Honey Birdette (premium lingerie retail with 75+ stores globally). Wholesale includes Yandy.com (costumes and intimates).  \n\nPost-2021 SPAC merger (via Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp.), PLBY pivoted from print magazines to digital/media-first, acquiring Honey Birdette (2021, $195M), Yandy (2022), and others to build an omnichannel \"Playboy Lifestyle\" ecosystem. Q2 2024 revenue was $42.1 million (verified from Aug 14, 2024 earnings), with gross margins at 51.3%. Despite challenges like post-pandemic normalization and segment divestitures (e.g., 49% stake in Wow Tech sold in 2023), PLBY focuses on membership growth, experiential events (Playboy Club re-launches), and licensing expansion in Asia/Europe. The brand boasts 11M+ social followers and partnerships with 80+ licensees, positioning it as a cultural icon in intimates, pop culture, and experiential entertainment amid a fragmented adult/lifestyle market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release – Revenue $42.1M (-18% YoY, impacted by Wow Tech equity sale); Licensing $14.8M (+3%); DTC $14.5M (-17%); Wholesale $12.8M (-22%).

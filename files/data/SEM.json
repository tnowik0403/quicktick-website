(SEM) is a premier live entertainment and media company, best known for owning and operating the iconic Sphere venue in Las Vegas, a groundbreaking 366-foot-tall, 516-foot-wide immersive entertainment dome that opened in September 2023. The company also controls MSG Networks, a leading regional sports media network broadcasting games for the NBA's New York Knicks, NHL's New York Rangers, and WNBA's New York Liberty, reaching ~4.5 million households. Additionally, SEM owns Tao Group Hospitality, a global nightlife and hospitality group with 80+ venues worldwide, including nightclubs, restaurants, and dayclubs. Headquartered in New York, SEM focuses on high-margin experiential entertainment, leveraging proprietary technologies like the Sphere's 16K LED exosphere exterior, 160,000+ interior speakers, and haptic seating for concerts, residencies, events, and immersive films.

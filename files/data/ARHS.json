(NYSE: ARHS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and NYSE):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $13.41\n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.30 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $9.47 - $17.06\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.47 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nArlo Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ARHS) is a global leader in smart home security, specializing in wireless, battery-powered security cameras, video doorbells, floodlights, and related accessories. Founded in 2018 as a spin-off from Netgear, Arlo emphasizes user-friendly, subscription-based ecosystems that deliver high-quality 2K/4K video, color night vision, and AI-powered features like person/vehicle/package detection via its Arlo Secure plans. The company's hardware is sold through major retailers (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy, Costco) and e-commerce, while recurring revenue from subscriptions (cloud storage, advanced analytics) now drives ~70% of profitability. Arlo targets the $50B+ smart home security market, focusing on DIY consumers seeking affordable, no-contract alternatives to professionally installed systems. With 3.8 million paid subscribers as of Q2 2024, Arlo reported record Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth, expanding internationally (EMEA/APAC ~30% of revenue). Challenges include hardware commoditization and competition from Amazon's Ring and Google's Nest, but tailwinds from rising home security demand and subscription stickiness position Arlo for multi-year growth.

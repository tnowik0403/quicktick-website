(NYSE: DIN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $28.42\n- **Market Capitalization**: $437.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $24.90 - $54.80\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 8.12\n- **Dividend Yield**: 2.11% (quarterly dividend of $0.15/share declared September 26, 2024, payable October 17, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nDine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN) is a leading full-service restaurant franchisor owning the Applebee's Grill + Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands. Headquartered in Glendale, California, DIN operates a dual-brand portfolio: Applebee's, with ~1,670 locations (primarily U.S.), targets casual dining with American favorites like burgers, ribs, salads, and value-driven promotions (e.g., $1 margaritas, 2-for-$20 deals); IHOP, with ~1,700 locations globally, specializes in family-friendly breakfasts featuring pancakes, waffles, and all-day meals. As of Q2 2024, ~95% of units are franchised, generating revenue primarily from royalties (4-5% of sales), advertising fees, and franchise/incentivized development fees. DIN supports ~40,000 jobs and serves millions annually. The company has refranchised most company-owned stores since 2017, shifting to asset-light model amid casual dining pressures. In 2023, systemwide sales reached $3.6 billion (Applebee's $2.6B, IHOP $1.0B). Facing sector headwinds like traffic declines, DIN emphasizes digital ordering, loyalty programs, and international growth (e.g., 200+ IHOP units abroad).

Announced dividend cut from $0.50 to $0.15/quarter to preserve cash amid $276M debt.\n- **Q3 2024 Guidance (August 1)**: Expects Applebee's comps -2% to flat; IHOP flat to +1%; full-year capex $25-30M.\n- **Store Activity (September 30, 2024)**: Opened 12 net new units (7 IHOP, 5 Applebee's); closed 25 (mostly underperforming Applebee's).

Weak comps, closures, and debt outweigh value appeal amid casual dining slump. Limited growth upside vs. peers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $35.00 (23% upside from $28.42). Based on 8x 2025E EBITDA ($80M est., consensus), assuming +1% comps/debt paydown. Suits moderate risk but lacks strong growth for aggressive portfolios (prefers TXRH/DRI). DCF implies $32-38 range.",

CAGR) in premium basin, undervalued vs. peers (2.5x EV/EBITDA vs. 4x sector). Moderate risk from size/volatility/commodity exposure suits growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $5.50/share (105% upside) – Based on 4x 2025E EV/EBITDA ($22M EBITDA est.), 2,700 Boe/d prod., $70/bbl WTI. DCF implies $6.00 at 12% IRR. Entry below $2.50 for >100% upside.",

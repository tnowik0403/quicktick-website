Founded in 1838 and headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, the company operates through two main segments: Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS) and Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS). ACS, which accounts for ~80% of revenue, provides high-performance laminates, circuit materials, and bonding solutions used in RF/microwave antennas, 5G infrastructure, aerospace/defense radar systems, and high-speed digital applications. EMS focuses on customizable engineered materials like foams, tapes, and vibration dampers for consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, wearables), automotive (EV battery seals), and appliances.\n\nROG's materials enable miniaturization, higher frequencies, thermal management, and reliability in harsh environments. Key end-markets include wireless communications (5G/6G), electric vehicles (EVs) and power electronics (inverters, chargers), autonomous driving (ADAS radars), defense (hypersonics, electronic warfare), and clean energy (solar inverters). With ~4,200 employees across 25+ global facilities, ROG generated $950M+ in trailing 12-month revenue (as of Q2 2024), emphasizing innovation via R&D (invests ~7-8% of sales). The company benefits from secular tailwinds in electrification and connectivity, positioning it as a niche supplier to Tier-1 OEMs and fabless chip designers.

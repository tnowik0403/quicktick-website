The company provides a full suite of commercial banking, retail banking, trust and wealth management, and non-bank financial services across Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and North Carolina. As of Q3 2024, PRK manages approximately $11.7 billion in total assets, $9.3 billion in loans, and $11.2 billion in deposits, serving individuals, small-to-medium businesses, and municipalities with a community-focused model emphasizing relationship banking.\n\nPRK's operations are segmented into three key areas: (1) **Park National Bank**, which generates ~95% of revenue through interest income on loans (commercial, real estate, consumer), fees from deposits/services, and wealth management; (2) **Guardian Financial Services**, a niche auto finance lender; and (3) **Scope Leasing**, equipment financing. The company prioritizes conservative underwriting, high asset quality (non-performing loans at 0.25% in Q3 2024), and a robust dividend history (58 consecutive years of increases, current yield ~2.7%). PRK differentiates via its 12 community bank divisions (e.g., Security, Cornerstone), enabling localized decision-making. While not a high-growth entity, it benefits from Midwest economic stability, low charge-offs (0.10% annualized), and a fortress balance sheet (TCE/TA ratio ~10%). Recent strategic shifts focus on organic loan growth and selective expansion amid normalizing rates.

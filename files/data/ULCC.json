(ULCC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $3.24 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $754.2 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $2.79 - $6.62  \n**Data Sources:** Latest from SEC filings (8-K/Q2 10-Q filed August 7, 2024), earnings call transcript (August 7, 2024 via Seeking Alpha), company IR site, Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, Barron's articles (e.g., September 2024 coverage), Reddit/WallStreetBets discussions (high volume on engine issues), and analyst notes from JPMorgan (September 25, 2024 downgrade).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFrontier Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ULCC), founded in 1994 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, operates Frontier Airlines, one of the largest ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCC) in the United States. The company focuses on providing affordable air travel to leisure travelers through a network of over 140 domestic and international routes across 10 U.S. bases and Puerto Rico, serving more than 100 airports. Frontier's business model emphasizes high aircraft utilization (12-13 hours/day), single-class all-economy seating with optional add-ons (bags, seats, snacks generating ~50% of revenue), and a modern fleet of ~150 Airbus A320-family aircraft (average age 5.5 years, fuel-efficient neo variants). As of Q2 2024, it carried 7.7 million revenue passengers, with a strategy centered on low base fares to stimulate demand in underserved markets. ULCC competes by undercutting legacy carriers by 50-70% on fares while targeting price-sensitive customers. The company went public via IPO in April 2021 at $11/share but has faced post-pandemic challenges like capacity constraints and rising costs. Recent Q2 2024 results showed revenue stability amid sector headwinds, with a focus on returning to profitability through cost discipline and network growth.

DCF-based (8% WACC, 3% terminal growth, 2025 revenue $3.9B, EBITDA margin 12%) assuming engine fixes by mid-2025; aligns with 1.2x 2026 EV/Sales (peer avg.). Strong growth requires flawless execution—moderate risk appetite favors waiting for Q3 earnings (Nov 2024).",

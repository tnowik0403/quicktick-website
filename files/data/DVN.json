Headquartered in Oklahoma City, Devon operates high-quality acreage primarily in the Delaware Basin (Permian Basin, ~64% of production), Eagle Ford Shale (~20%), and Williston Basin (Bakken, ~12%), with minor exposure in the DJ Basin. The company emphasizes capital efficiency, targeting top-tier returns through low-cost drilling and advanced completions technology.\n\nDevon's business model revolves around generating free cash flow (FCF) in all price environments, underpinned by a ~2,800 drilling inventory locations with average IRRs >60% at $60 WTI. It employs a unique FCF allocation framework: ~50% to balance sheet/debt reduction and variable dividends, ~30% to fixed dividend and share repurchases, and ~20% to growth investments. Production averaged 665 Mboe/d in Q2 2024, with ~77% oil/liquids mix. Devon's scale in the Permian (310,000 net acres) positions it as a consolidation play, while its fixed-plus-variable dividend (current fixed $0.22/qtr + variable) yields ~5-7% at current prices, appealing to income-focused investors. ESG efforts include CCUS pilots and methane reduction, aligning with energy transition trends.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 7, 2024):** Reported revenue of $3.88 billion (beat estimates by 5%), EPS of $1.24 (vs. $1.09 expected), EBITDA $2.2 billion.

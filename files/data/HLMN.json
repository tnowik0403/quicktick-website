The company serves a diverse customer base across retail channels such as big-box home improvement stores (e.g., Home Depot, Lowe's), mass merchants (e.g., Walmart), grocery chains, auto parts retailers (e.g., AutoZone), and commercial/industrial accounts like contractors and OEMs. Founded in 1898 and headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hillman operates through an asset-light model emphasizing replenishment programs, point-of-sale displays, and vending solutions to drive recurring revenue. With ~1,400 employees and a network of distribution centers, it focuses on proprietary branding (e.g., Minute Key kiosks) and high-margin categories resilient to economic cycles. In FY2023, Hillman generated $1.4B in revenue, benefiting from its ~50% market share in U.S. key duplication. The company's growth is fueled by digital kiosks, e-commerce expansion, and acquisitions, positioning it in the fragmented $10B+ U.S. hardware replenishment market.

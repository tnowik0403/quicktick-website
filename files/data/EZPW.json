(NASDAQ: EZPW) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Verified as of November 1, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- **Stock Price**: $10.92\n- **Market Capitalization**: $626.3 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $8.27 - $12.49\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 10.2\n- **Dividend Yield**: N/A (no dividend)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nEZCORP, Inc. is a financial services holding company primarily engaged in the pawnbroking business, operating over 500 pawn stores across the United States (primarily Texas, under EZPAWN and PawnKing brands) and Latin America (Mexico under Empeño Fácil and TruBlue brands). The company provides secured non-recourse loans (pawn loans) to underbanked consumers, purchasing merchandise for resale, and ancillary services like signature loans and fee-based credit services. In FY2024 (ended September 30, 2024), EZCORP generated revenue primarily from pawn loan liquidation sales (retail merchandise, ~70%) and pawn service charges (~30%). \n\nThe business model thrives in economic uncertainty, as pawn loans offer quick cash without credit checks, appealing to ~40 million unbanked/underbanked Americans. US operations contribute ~85% of revenue, with Mexico providing diversification amid US regulatory pressures. Recent digital enhancements, like online inventory sales via pawnshops.com, have boosted merchandise margins. EZCORP emphasizes operational efficiency through store rationalization (closed ~50 underperforming US stores in 2023-2024) and tech investments in loan origination/inventory management. With a pawn loan balance of $225 million (up 5% YoY as of Q4 FY2024), the company reported record FY2024 revenue of $1.18 billion (verified from Q4 earnings release, October 29, 2024). Net income reached $75.4 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $152.6 million. Gross margins improved to 47.5% from better inventory yields.

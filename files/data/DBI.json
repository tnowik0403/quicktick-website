(NYSE: DBI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 15, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $5.95 (close on October 11, 2024; intraday as of October 15 ~$6.05 per Yahoo Finance/Google Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $377.2 million (as of October 11, 2024 close, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $5.30 - $13.91  \n**Avg. Daily Volume:** ~1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nDesigner Brands Inc. (DBI) is a Columbus, Ohio-based designer, producer, and retailer of footwear, apparel, and accessories, operating primarily in North America. The company runs a portfolio of retail banners including Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) stores and dsw.com in the U.S., as well as The Shoe Company and Shoe Warehouse in Canada. DBI's Retail segment, which accounts for ~95% of revenue, focuses on value-priced designer and name-brand shoes for women, men, and kids, alongside handbags, hosiery, and apparel. Its smaller Brand Portfolio segment (~5%) wholesales premium footwear brands like Vince (acquired in 2013, now comprising ~80% of this segment) and Zackary to department stores and specialty retailers. With ~650 stores (down from 700+ pre-COVID via optimization), DBI emphasizes an off-mall store fleet (85%+ off-mall), digital sales (26% of Q2 sales), and private-label growth (targeting 40% of assortments). The company navigates a competitive $80B+ U.S. footwear market by blending physical experiential retail (wide assortments, low prices) with e-commerce fulfillment from stores. FY2023 revenue was $3.05B, but recent softness in consumer discretionary spending has pressured results amid macroeconomic headwinds. (198 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 29, 2024**: Q2 FY2024 earnings released – missed consensus on revenue ($692.5M vs. $720.7M expected, -4.2% YoY) and EPS ($0.08 vs. $0.14 expected). Gross margin improved to 33.0% (+180 bps YoY) from supply chain efficiencies; net sales declined due to -3% traffic and weaker average unit value.\n- **September 10, 2024**: Barington Capital Group (activist investor, 1.3% stake) sent letter urging board refresh, CEO search, and divestiture of underperforming assets like the Brand Portfolio; stock +15% on news.\n- **October 2, 2024**: Announced store closures (12 DSW locations) as part of fleet optimization; now ~640 stores.\n- **July 24, 2024**: Q1 FY2024 results – revenue $719.6M (-3.5% YoY), EPS $0.17 (beat $0.06 est.); comparable sales -5.8%.\n- Ongoing: Back-to-school promotions emphasized in September earnings call; holiday inventory positioned flat YoY.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Accelerate digital sales to 30%+ of total (from 26% in Q2); invest in site personalization and store-to-home fulfillment.\n- Expand private labels to 40% of assortments (up from 30%) for higher margins (45-50% vs. 25-30% branded).\n- Optimize store fleet: Close 30-40 underperformers annually, remodel 50 for \"next-gen\" format (better lighting, apparel focus).\n- Enhance loyalty program (DSW VIP, 30M+ members) for retention; target millennials/Gen Z via social/influencer marketing.\n- Brand Portfolio: Grow Vince wholesale internationally; explore spin-off per activist pressure.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Weak traffic (-3% Q2), apparel sales decline (-10% Q2), high SG&A (26.5% of sales), debt ($124M net debt Q2). Activist scrutiny risks distraction. | Gross margin expansion (33% Q2), inventory -7% YoY ($479M), private-label traction (+mid-teens Q2). |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Discretionary pullback (inflation, high rates), Amazon/Zappos dominance (60%+ online footwear), off-price cannibalization (TJX/Ross). Footwear market growth slowed to 2% in 2024 (NPD Group). | Footwear category resilient (+3-4% U.S. market 2024 est.); holiday/back-to-school seasonality; potential rate cuts boost spending. E-comm growth 8-10%. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Retail**: Women's shoes (50% sales: sneakers, heels, boots from Nike, Adidas, Steve Madden); men's/kids' footwear; accessories (bags 10%, hosiery).\n- **Private Labels**: BG Shoes, DSW-branded (30% assortments).\n- **Brand Portfolio**: Vince premium sneakers/leather goods (wholesale to Nordstrom/Macy's); Zackary fashion shoes.\n- Services: Buy online/pickup in-store, VIP rewards (free shipping >$50).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Next-Gen Stores**: 50 remodels in FY2024 with apparel expansion (to 25% space from 15%), sneaker walls; first opened Q4 2023.\n- **Digital Enhancements**: AI-driven recommendations launched Q1 2024; app redesign Q3 2024 for personalized feeds.\n- **Vince Expansion**: New direct-to-consumer e-comm site piloted Canada Q3 2024; international wholesale push (Europe/Asia).\n- **Sustainability Initiative**: Recycled-material sneakers line (5 SKUs Q2 2024).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current U.S. Footwear Retail Share**: ~1.5-2% (Statista/NPD; $80B market, DBI Retail ~$2.9B annualized).\n- **Online Footwear**: ~3-4% (behind Zappos 25%+, Amazon 30%).\n- **Forecast**: Mild decline to 1.2-1.5% by FY2026 due to closures/digital shift and competition; offset by private-label gains. Sector growth 3-5% CAGR; DBI expects 1-3% revenue growth FY2025 if consumer stabilizes (earnings call).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | DBI | Foot Locker (FL) | Macy's (M) | TJX Companies (TJX) |\n|----------------------------|-----|-------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| **Revenue** | $3.05B | $8.12B | $23.1B | $51.5B |\n| **Gross Margin** | 32.5% | 27.8% | 37.2% | 29.8% |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 5.2x | 7.1x | 8.4x | 18.5x |\n| **Comparable Sales Gr.** | -4.5% | -2.8% | -1.5% | +4.0% |\n| **Store Count** | 640 | 2,500+ | 500+ dept. | 4,900+ |\n| **Key Edge** | Designer value focus | Athleisure/sneakers | Dept. store breadth | Off-price treasure hunt |\n\nDBI trades at discount (P/S 0.12x vs. peers 0.5-1.5x) but lags growth/traffic.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term with Nike (top vendor 25% purchases), Skechers, Puma; VIP co-brands with Crocs (2024 sneaker collab).\n- **M&A**: None recent; sold off Keds/Superga 2019. Activists push Brand Portfolio sale (Vince valued ~$200M).\n- **Major Clients (Wholesale)**: Nordstrom (15% Brand Portfolio sales), Macy's, Dillard's.\n- **Potential**: Vince DTC expansion targets Neiman Marcus upscale; Canada growth eyes Hudson's Bay.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Doug Howe (since 2021) focused on ops efficiency; board under activist fire (Barington seeks 4 seats).\n- **ESG**: B Corp certified Vince; 20% recycled packaging goal by 2025.\n- **Risks**: High short interest (18%), consumer recession sensitivity.\n- **Opportunities**: Share buyback authorized $100M (10% mcap); dividend suspended 2023 but potential restart.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (Hold/Sell bias). Fundamentals weak (missed 4 straight quarters), activist overhang, macro sensitivity limit upside. Growth potential if holidays surprise (Q3 guide implies flat sales), but moderate risk appetite favors waiting for $5 support or Barington catalyst.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $8.50 (42% upside). Based on 0.3x FY2025E sales ($3.2B, 5% growth), 8x EV/EBITDA ($480M est.), assuming margin to 34% and consumer recovery. DCF supports $7-10 range (WACC 11%, 2% terminal growth). Not for strong growth portfolios (prefer TJX/RL).",

Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nGlaukos Corporation (NYSE: GKOS) is a precision ophthalmology technology leader focused on innovative therapies for glaucoma, the second-leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting over 80 million people globally. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, the company pioneers Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) devices and sustained-release drug delivery systems. Its flagship iStent platform, including iStent inject® W and iStent infinite®, enables glaucoma surgeons to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) during cataract surgery with microscopic implants that enhance fluid outflow via the trabecular meshwork—the eye's primary drainage pathway. In 2023, Glaukos launched iDose TR®, a breakthrough intracameral travoprost implant for long-duration IOP control (up to 3 years), marking its entry into pharmaceutical delivery. With ~585 employees, Glaukos operates primarily in the U.S. (90%+ revenue), expanding internationally via CE Mark approvals in Europe and partnerships in Japan/Asia. The glaucoma market, valued at ~$6B in 2023, is projected to grow to $10B+ by 2030 due to aging populations and demand for less invasive treatments over traditional drops or surgery. Glaukos reported Q2 2024 net revenue of $86.9M (up 17% YoY), driven by 24% glaucoma segment growth to $80.4M, positioning it as a high-growth medtech pure-play amid sector consolidation.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Net revenue $86.9M (+17% YoY); Glaucoma franchise $80.4M (+24% YoY); iStent inject® exceeded 1 million units implanted globally; gross margin 73.7%.\n- **September 18, 2024**: Announced full U.S. commercial launch of iDose TR® in ~100 additional accounts, reaching 350+ centers; early adoption strong with 1,000+ implants.\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported iStent infinite® CE Mark approval in EU; U.S. pivotal trial data presented at ESCRS showing 45% IOP reduction at 12 months.\n- **June 2024**: Expanded iDose TR® training with 50+ surgeon proctorships.\n- **October 2, 2024**: Insider purchase by EVP of ~$500K in shares at ~$110, signaling confidence.\n- **September 2024**: Positive coverage decisions from major payers (e.g., Aetna, Cigna) for iDose TR®, accelerating reimbursement.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: (1) U.S. MIGS dominance via iStent portfolio expansion (target 20%+ annual glaucoma growth); (2) iDose TR® scale-up to $100M+ peak U.S. sales by 2027 via surgeon education and payer wins; (3) International commercialization (EU/Japan launches 2025); (4) Pipeline advancement (e.g., iStent ultrascale, next-gen iDose).\n- **2024 Guidance**: Full-year revenue $340-348M (+15-18% YoY); reaffirmed post-Q2.\n- **Long-Term**: Aim for $1B+ revenue by 2030 via 25% CAGR, leveraging 20,000+ trained U.S. surgeons and MIGS market penetration from 15% to 30%+.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Strong iStent installed base (1M+ units); iDose TR® early traction (50% repeat surgeons); improving gross margins (73%+). | Surgeon training ramp for iDose (early stage); inventory adjustments in Cornea segment (-19% Q2). |\n| **Sector**  | Glaucoma prevalence +5% annually (aging demographics); MIGS shift from drops (80% non-compliance); $10B TAM growth. | Reimbursement delays for novel devices; surgeon adoption inertia; supply chain inflation. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **iStent inject® W**: Dual-stent MIGS for mild-moderate glaucoma; ~80% of glaucoma revenue; implanted in 1M+ eyes since 2012.\n- **iStent infinite®**: Standalone MIGS for moderate-severe glaucoma; U.S. launch 2021, 10x procedure volume YoY.\n- **iAccess®**: Next-gen ab interno canaloplasty (limited launch).\n- **Cornea Segment**: Zeiss EX-PRESS® shunt and iLink® for keratoconus; $6.5M Q2 revenue (-19% YoY).\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **iDose TR®**: Launched U.S. March 2024; refillable travoprost implant; 2-year data (Aug 2024 ESCRS): 30% IOP drop, 80% drop-free.\n- **iStent infinite® EU Launch**: Planned H1 2025 post-CE Mark.\n- **Pipeline**: iStent ultrascale (preclinical, micro-stent swarm); iDose MR (mid-stage); retinal programs (paused post-2023 strategic review).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current (2024 est., via company filings & industry reports e.g., Grand View Research)**: ~55% U.S. MIGS stent market (vs. 20% in 2020); <5% overall glaucoma (drops dominate).\n- **Forecast**: U.S. MIGS share to 65-70% by 2026 (+5-10ppt growth) via iStent infinite®/iDose combo; global MIGS to 10% by 2028 (company target). iDose to capture 15-20% sustained-release segment by 2027.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Competitor (Ticker) | Key Products                  | 2023 Revenue (Glaucoma) | Strengths                  | GKOS Edge                          |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Alcon (ALC)**    | Hydrus Microstent            | ~$1.2B (ophthalmic)     | Scale, cataract combo     | GKOS: Higher volume, lower cost/device |\n| **J&J Vision**     | iTrack (ab interno)          | ~$800M (surgical)       | Global reach              | GKOS: Proven safety (1M+ cases), drug-delivery moat |\n| **New World Medical** | Paul Glaucoma Implant     | Private (~$50M est.)    | Tube shunts               | GKOS: MIGS minimally invasive preference |\n| **Ivantis/Alcon**  | Hydrus (acquired 2023)       | N/A (recent)            | Strong data               | GKOS: Earlier market, broader portfolio |\n\nGKOS trades at ~10x 2025 EV/Sales (vs. ALC 5x, peers 7x) on superior 20%+ growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Distribution in Japan (Santen, 2023 deal for iStent); EU tenders ongoing.

Company Overview (ETR) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nEntergy Corporation, headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations in the United States. The company generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, including the City of New Orleans, and delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers across these four states. The company's power plants have approximately 25,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity. Entergy Corporation was founded in 1913.\n\nThe company operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Parent & Other. The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; it also operates a small natural gas distribution business. Entergy generates electricity through gas, nuclear, coal, hydro, and solar power sources. The company is a Fortune 500 company and has approximately 12,000 employees.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 17, 2025, ETR is trading at $92.55, down -1.31 (-1.40%) at market close. The company has a market capitalization of $41.33 billion with a beta of 0.65 and a P/E ratio of 22.80.

ETR's trailing dividend yield is 2.62%.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nEntergy generates electricity through gas, nuclear, coal, hydro, and solar power sources, and sells energy to retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies. The company's generation mix consisted of 25% legacy gas/oil, 22% nuclear power, 8% coal and 1% renewables, with 24,000 megawatt of generating capacity, including more than 5,000 MW of nuclear fuel capacity, distributing electricity to approximately 3 million customers.\n\nEntergy owns and operates one of the cleanest large-scale U.S. power-generating fleets including more than five gigawatts of carbon-free nuclear capacity, a fleet of highly efficient gas resources, and a fast-growing portfolio of renewable resources. Until 2025, Entergy also operated natural gas distribution businesses serving approximately 96,000 homes and businesses in the Baton Rouge area and approximately 108,000 homes and businesses in New Orleans.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Delta Blues Advanced Power Station\nIn November 2024, Entergy Mississippi celebrated the groundbreaking of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station in Greenville, Mississippi, which will be a 754-megawatt facility capable of powering 385,000 homes across Entergy Mississippi's 45-county service area, replacing the Gerald Andrus Steam Electric Station which will be retired when the new plant comes online in 2028. The $1.2 billion investment represents a significant economic impact for the Mississippi Delta, including more than 300 construction jobs in the area over the next several years.\n\nThe new facility will be equipped with a combined-cycle combustion turbine and dual-fuel technology, and while natural gas is the primary resource, it will be designed to support blended hydrogen to produce reliable energy while significantly reducing carbon emissions.\n\n### Meta Data Center Infrastructure\nIn December 2024, Meta announced plans for a $10 billion AI data center in Richland Parish, northeast Louisiana, which will span over 4 million square feet and be Meta's largest data center to date. To meet the energy demands, Entergy plans to construct three new natural gas plants near the site at a cost of $3 billion.\n\nThe Louisiana Public Service Commission approved three new combined-cycle gas plants, totaling roughly 2.3 GW, along with the transmission needed to deliver the power to Meta's Hyperion data-center complex.\n\n### Google Arkansas Project\nIn October 2024, Google announced a $4 billion investment in Arkansas, which includes a data-center campus supported by new Entergy-sponsored generation, with the utility pursuing a 600 MW solar facility with a 350 MW battery system and a proposed 754 MW combined-cycle plant.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nEntergy's capital allocation has pivoted decisively towards infrastructure dedicated to serving large-load industrial customers, particularly AI data centers. A $40 billion capital plan through 2028 underpins this strategic direction, with specific, large-scale investments in both generation and transmission being approved and initiated in 2025.\n\nEntergy expects its industrial electric sales will grow by about 13% per year for the next few years, driven by data centers coming online in its service territory. In recent years, Entergy's industrial sales have spurred roughly 5% annual sales growth. Ultimately, Entergy's sales could triple or quadruple by 2050.\n\nThe company has a customer-led plan to invest for continued growth, reliability and resilience while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk for all stakeholders, planning to invest $37 billion through 2028 to meet expected growth.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Confirmed Major Customers\n- **Meta (Facebook)**: Meta will be Entergy's largest customer, thanks to two gigawatts of power running 24/7.\n- **Amazon Web Services**: Entergy Mississippi began discussions with Amazon Web Services in 2019 about locating one of its largest data center campuses in the state, with Amazon's $10 billion investment in Madison County announced in 2024 as one of the \"biggest economic development wins in Mississippi history.\"\n- **Google**: Google announced a $4 billion investment in Arkansas for a data-center campus.\n\n### Industrial Growth Potential\nThe concentration of tens of billions of dollars of investment from Meta ($10B in LA), AWS ($10B in MS), Google ($4B in AR), and AVAIO ($6B in MS) within a single utility's footprint is unprecedented.\n\nIndustrial electricity rates that are below the US average are driving strong industrial development, including data center growth, in Entergy's Gulf Coast service territory.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### 2024 Financial Results\nEntergy reported fourth quarter 2024 earnings per share of 65 cents on an as-reported basis and 66 cents on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n### Investment Strengths\n- **AI/Data Center Positioning**: Entergy is exceptionally well-positioned for the AI data center boom with secured contracts from Meta ($10B), AWS ($10B), and Google ($4B)\n- **Growth Trajectory**: 13% expected annual industrial sales growth driven by data centers vs. historical 5%\n- **Capital Investment Plan**: $37-40 billion capital plan through 2028 to support growth\n- **Regulatory Support**: Favorable regulatory environment across its four-state footprint\n- **Financial Performance**: Strong 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.65, beating guidance\n\n### Investment Risks\n- **Environmental Opposition**: Growing resistance to new gas plant construction\n- **Hurricane Exposure**: Gulf Coast location creates weather-related operational risks\n- **Carbon Goals**: Conflict between new gas generation and 2030 carbon reduction targets\n- **Execution Risk**: Massive capital deployment requires flawless execution\n\n### Market Valuation Context\n- Current P/E ratio of 22.80 vs. utility sector average\n- 75% stock price appreciation over past 12 months suggests high expectations already priced in\n- Beta of 0.65 indicates lower volatility relative to market\n\n**Buy Rating: 7.8/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $105-110**\n\n**Rationale**: Entergy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI-driven electricity demand surge with confirmed multi-billion dollar customer commitments and supportive regulatory frameworks. The company's strategic focus on data center customers in the Gulf South region, combined with its substantial capital investment plan, positions it for exceptional growth. However, the stock has already seen significant appreciation, and execution risks around the massive capital deployment and environmental opposition create some uncertainty. The fair value estimate reflects a premium to current levels based on the transformational nature of the data center opportunity, while acknowledging that much of the upside may already be reflected in current valuations.",

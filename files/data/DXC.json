Strategic review ongoing (May 2024).\n- **Current Major Clients** (top 10 = 35% revenue): US DoD/Navy ($1B+), BNP Paribas, Merck, P&G.\n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding in healthcare (e.g., NHS pilots), telcos (Vodafone pursuits per Q1 call).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong cybersecurity (ISO 27001); diversity (35% women execs); carbon neutral goal 2030.\n- **Management**: CEO Mike Salvino (since 2020) focused on turnaround; activist pressure from Mulberry Street (5% stake, Mar 2024).\n- **Risks**: High churn (15% client loss risk); India ops exposure (50% workforce).\n- **Opportunities**: $10B AI services pipeline; US govt contracts ($5B+ pursuits).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 4/10 (Sell/Hold)**: Weak revenue growth, margin pressure, and sector laggard status outweigh AI tailwinds. Fundamentals improving (cost savings) but high debt and divestiture overhang limit upside. Suitable for value/income (2.9% dividend yield), not growth.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $22.50** (17% upside from $19.26): DCF-based (8% EBITDA margin FY26, 7x EV/EBITDA multiple, moderate risk; aligns with peer avg discount). Strong growth portfolio would require 20%+ CAGR – DXC projects flat-to-low single digits. Hold for turnaround confirmation post-Q2 earnings (Nov 2024).",

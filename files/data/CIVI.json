(NYSE: CIVI) is a Denver-headquartered independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused on developing high-quality, low-cost oil and natural gas assets primarily in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin of Colorado and Wyoming, with growing exposure in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Formed through the 2023 merger of Extraction Oil & Gas and Crestone Peak Resources (rebranded as Civitas), the company emphasizes operational efficiency, capital discipline, and ESG principles, including water recycling and emissions reduction. Civitas operates ~500,000 net acres in the DJ Basin, targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations, and has expanded into the Permian via bolt-on acquisitions.\n\nThe company produces crude oil (~55% of mix), NGLs, and natural gas, with a strategy centered on multi-well pads, extended laterals (avg. 10,000+ ft), and low breakeven costs (~$45-50/WTI for DJ). In 2023, it achieved record production of 179,000 Boe/d, scaling to 196,000 Boe/d in Q2 2024. Civitas differentiates via its \"Civitas Way\" operational model, achieving top-quartile well costs ($700-800/ft) and recycling 95%+ of produced water. Financially disciplined, it returns ~50% of free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders via dividends (current yield ~5.5%, $1.95/share annualized) and buybacks ($300M authorized). With a debt-to-EBITDA of ~1.0x and $800M+ liquidity, Civitas is positioned for M&A in a consolidating E&P sector amid favorable oil prices (WTI ~$70-75/bbl).

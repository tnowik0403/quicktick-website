Growth Strategy\n\nEdison International (EIX) is positioned for a period of regulated asset growth, driven by California's aggressive clean energy mandates, with analysts forecasting an average annual consolidated earnings growth rate of 8% through 2028. Management maintains confidence in delivering a 5% to 7% Core EPS growth rate annually from 2025 through 2028, projecting an estimated 2028 EPS range of $6.74 to $7.14.\n\nTo meet increasing electricity demand, the company follows a systematic capital investment strategy to strengthen its infrastructure to provide safe and resilient electricity, with the company expecting a long-term capital investment of $28-$29 billion during the 2025-2028 period, with nearly 97% allocated to critical transmission, distribution, and generation capacity.\n\nEdison International's vision is to lead the transformation of the electric power industry toward a clean energy future, which maps directly to California's ambitious climate targets and guides their strategic investments, demanding accelerated investment in grid modernization, energy storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure to achieve 100% carbon-free power for customers by 2045.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nEdison International serves residential, commercial, industrial, public authorities, agricultural, and other sectors. Edison International is the parent company of Southern California Edison, an electric utility that distributes electricity to 5 million customers in a 50,000-square-mile area of Southern California, excluding Los Angeles.\n\nThe company has been making systematic investments to strengthen and expand its infrastructure to meet the rising demand from data centers. The non-regulated segment, Trio (formerly Edison Energy), focuses on providing integrated sustainability and energy advisory services to large commercial and industrial customers.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Financial Results:\nEdison International reported third-quarter net income of $832 million, or $2.16 per share, compared to net income of $516 million, or $1.33 per share, in the third quarter of last year. Edison International reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of $2.34 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 by 8.3%, with the bottom line increasing 55% from $1.51 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nEdison International's third-quarter operating revenues totaled $5.75 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.61 billion by 2.6%, with the top line increasing 10.6% from the year-ago quarter's figure of $5.2 billion.\n\n### 2025 Guidance & Financial Metrics:\nThe company has narrowed its 2025 earnings outlook, with EIX expecting to generate earnings in the range of $5.95-$6.20 per share compared with the previous guidance of $5.94-$6.34. In 2024, Edison International's revenue was $17.60 billion, an increase of 7.72% compared to the previous year's $16.34 billion, with earnings of $1.28 billion, an increase of 7.27%.\n\nAs of September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $364 million compared with $193 million as of December 31, 2024, with long-term debt at $34.48 billion as of September 30, 2025, higher than the 2024-end level of $33.53 billion.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\nThe company's core business, Southern California Edison (SCE), benefits from a constructive regulatory environment, notably the 2025 General Rate Case (GRC) final decision, which authorized a $9.7 billion base revenue for 2025. Significant state and federal investment, along with policy momentum for decarbonization, will underwrite large-scale grid modernization and renewable energy integration projects, providing Edison International with stable, above-inflation capital expenditure opportunities and expanding its regulated rate base.\n\n### Headwinds:\nBased on currently available information about the ignition of the Eaton Fire, it is likely that SCE equipment could have been associated with the ignition, with SCE not aware of evidence pointing to another plausible source of ignition. Wildfires in California are a significant political and financial risk even with state legislation that offers financial protection.\n\nS&P downgraded Edison International and SCE by one notch, despite legislative improvements, with the company facing challenges in estimating potential losses associated with the Eaton Fire, with no clear timeline for determining liability.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nBased on the number of people served by the electric utility segments, EIX's Southern California Edison (SCE) holds a significant share, just slightly behind PG&E Corporation, but Sempra Energy's electric utility (San Diego Gas & Electric) is much smaller. According to 2023 industry data, Edison International ranked 12th among U.S. investor-owned electric utilities with a market cap of $27.381 billion, representing 3.08% of the total market.\n\nSouthern California Edison operates as a territorial monopoly, meaning it faces virtually no direct competition for electricity delivery within its 50,000 square-mile service territory, providing highly stable, recession-resilient cash flows.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nEIX competes primarily with the two other major investor-owned utilities (IOUs) in California: PG&E Corporation and Sempra Energy, with competition in the electric utility market being less about price wars and more about scale, regulatory capital deployment, and geographic diversification.\n\nWithin California's regulated utility market, Southern California Edison (SCE) faces direct competition from other major investor-owned utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), with public power utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also representing significant competition.\n\nOn a national level, SCE's peers include large utility holding companies like Sempra Energy, Duke Energy Corporation, Exelon Energy, and The AES Corporation, which compete through their substantial scale, investment capabilities, and diversified energy portfolios.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nOn December 23, 2025, Edison International secured a $900 million term loan, with the new loan enhancing liquidity, supporting debt management, and strengthening key banking relationships, entered into with a syndicate of lenders led by Wells Fargo Bank, maturing on December 22, 2026.\n\nEdison International commenced cash tender offers on November 20, 2025 to purchase any and all outstanding preferred shares: Series B 5.00% and Series A 5.375% fixed-rate reset cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with the Offers expiring on December 19, 2025, with aggregate liquidation preference outstanding of $503,454,000 for Series B and $1,159,317,000 for Series A.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Eaton Fire and Wildfire Compensation:\nJust 45 days after Southern California Edison launched its Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program, the first payment has been made, with over 1,500 claims submitted and more payments to be made by year-end. SoCal Edison and its parent company, Edison International (EIX), are being sued by thousands of residents who allege faulty power lines sparked the blaze that killed 19 people.\n\nSouthern California Edison sued Los Angeles County, water agencies and Southern California Gas on Friday, alleging they bore some responsibility for last year's deadly Eaton fire, with the utility making those claims in complaints filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, where some 1,000 lawsuits by residents and business owners are seeking to hold SCE responsible.\n\n### Dividend Increase:\nEIX announced a cash dividend of 0.877 with an ex-date of Jan. 7, 2026, with Edison International rising 0.44% as it declared a quarterly dividend increase, contrasting with a 1% drop in the utilities sector amid wildfire exposure concerns.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Buy Rating: 6.5/10**\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $75-80**\n\n### Investment Rationale:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Strong regulatory position with 8% forecasted earnings growth through 2028\n- Massive $28-29 billion capital investment plan providing clear growth trajectory\n- Territorial monopoly status ensuring stable cash flows\n- Attractive 5.3% dividend yield\n- Strong analyst support with 10 buy recommendations vs. 1 sell\n\n**Risks:**\n- Significant wildfire liability exposure from Eaton Fire\n- Recent S&P credit downgrade\n- Stock down 30% over past six months due to wildfire concerns\n\nThe 6.5/10 rating reflects the company's solid fundamentals and growth prospects balanced against substantial wildfire-related risks. With Edison's $7 billion of planned annual investment during the next four years, analysts project 7% average annual earnings growth. The fair value estimate of $75-80 represents potential upside of 20-28% from current levels, justified by the company's regulated utility status, robust capital investment program, and California's clean energy transition tailwinds, while accounting for wildfire risk premium.",

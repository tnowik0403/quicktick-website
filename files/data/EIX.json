SCE serves approximately 15 million people across a 50,000-square-mile territory in central, coastal, and southern California, including major urban centers like Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Inland Empire. The company focuses on electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, with a growing emphasis on clean energy infrastructure. EIX also includes Edison Energy, a competitive subsidiary offering energy management services to commercial clients nationwide, though SCE represents ~99% of earnings.\n\nHistorically regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), SCE operates as a near-monopoly in its service area, investing heavily in grid modernization, wildfire mitigation, and renewables to meet California's aggressive decarbonization goals (e.g., 100% clean energy by 2045). Recent challenges include wildfire liabilities from the 2017-2018 Thomas and Mud Creek fires, largely resolved via a $4.9 billion settlement in October 2024. EIX's strategy centers on reliability, affordability, and sustainability amid rising electrification demand from EVs, data centers, and industrial growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 25, 2024)**: Adjusted EPS of $1.45 (beat consensus $1.22); core earnings $370 million (up 35% YoY).

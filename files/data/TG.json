(NASDAQ: TGTX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $19.22 (closing price as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.85 billion (verified as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n\n## Company Overview\nTG Therapeutics, Inc. (TGTX) is a commercial-stage, fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies targeting B-cell replication and survival for patients with B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, the company has transitioned from a development-stage biotech to a revenue-generating entity with its flagship product, Briumvi (ublituximab-xiiy), a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA on December 28, 2022, for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Briumvi offers a differentiated one-hour infusion regimen post-initial doses, positioning it as a potential best-in-class option in the anti-CD20 class.\n\nThe company's commercial launch of Briumvi began in January 2023, driving rapid revenue growth amid a competitive MS market valued at ~$25 billion globally. TG Therapeutics also maintains an early-stage pipeline in oncology, including investigational therapies like TG-1701 (a next-generation BTK inhibitor) and TG-1801 (a CD47 x CD19 bispecific antibody). Prior assets like Ukoniq (umbralisib + ublituximab) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and marginal zone lymphoma were voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market on April 1, 2022, following a clinical hold due to infection risks observed in trials. With ~180 commercial employees and a lean cost structure, TG Therapeutics reported its first GAAP profitable quarter in Q2 2024, emphasizing disciplined execution, payer access expansion (now covering >90% of RMS lives), and pipeline advancement to sustain long-term growth.

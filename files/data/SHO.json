(SHO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 31, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close on October 30, 2024)  \n**Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.sunstonehotels.com), Earnings call transcripts via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha, Bloomberg, REIT.com, recent press releases (last 6 months), analyst consensus from FactSet/Barrons.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (NYSE: SHO) is a self-advised and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the acquisition, ownership, and management of upper-upscale hotels and resorts across the United States. Founded in 2001 and headquartered in Aliso Viejo, California, SHO focuses on high-quality assets in prime gateway and resort markets, emphasizing convention-oriented, urban, and resort properties. As of Q3 2024, the portfolio comprises 17 hotels with approximately 8,718 rooms, representing a diversified mix: ~45% convention/urban (e.g., Hilton San Diego Bayfront), ~35% resort (e.g., Wailea Beach Resort - Marriott, Maui), and ~20% airport/suburban.  \n\nSHO's strategy centers on value-add investments through renovations, opportunistic acquisitions, and non-core asset sales to recycle capital into higher-return opportunities. Revenue is primarily from room sales (65-70%), food & beverage (15-20%), and other (10-15%), with a focus on group/transient demand balance. The company benefits from long-term management agreements with major operators like Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, ensuring operational expertise while retaining fee income. Post-COVID recovery has driven RevPAR growth, but SHO faces cyclical hospitality risks tied to travel demand, labor costs, and interest rates. With a lean portfolio post-2023 divestitures (sold 5 hotels for $316M), SHO targets 4-6% annual RevPAR growth via renovations and market tailwinds. Market cap ~$1.8B positions it as a mid-cap lodging REIT, trading at a discount to peers on AFFO multiples amid sector normalization.

Prefer over APLE (overvalued), edge vs HST on value.*\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $11.00/share  \n  *Methodology*: DCF (5% growth/8% discount, terminal 7% cap rate) + peer multiple (14x 2025 AFFO); implies 22% upside. Strong growth portfolio targets 15%+ IRR via acquisitions/renovs.*",

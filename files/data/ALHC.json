(NASDAQ: ALHC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $11.20\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.18 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $4.88 - $12.17\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 2.05 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAlignment Healthcare, Inc. (ALHC) is a technology-driven Medicare Advantage (MA) health plan operator targeting seniors aged 65+ in the U.S. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Orange, California, the company leverages its proprietary \"ALIGN\" platform—a cloud-based system integrating AI, data analytics, and real-time care coordination—to deliver personalized, high-touch care management. This tech stack enables risk adjustment, predictive interventions, and 24/7 concierge services, differentiating ALHC from traditional insurers by emphasizing prevention over reactive treatment.\n\nALHC operates health plans in 7 states (primarily California, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Texas, Georgia), serving ~155,700 members as of Q2 2024. Its model focuses on localized HMO and PPO plans with robust ancillary benefits like dental, vision, and over-the-air (OTA) allowances for rideshares/groceries. Revenue is generated via fixed per-member-per-month (PMPM) payments from CMS, supplemented by risk-adjusted premiums based on Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) coding.\n\nThe company has scaled rapidly amid booming MA enrollment (projected 50%+ of Medicare eligibles by 2025 per CMS), but faces sector scrutiny on star ratings and medical loss ratios (MLR). ALHC reported its first adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q2 2024, signaling maturation. With a 58% YoY membership growth, ALHC aims to capture share in fragmented regional markets through organic expansion and tech efficiencies, positioning as a disruptor against giants like Humana and UnitedHealth.

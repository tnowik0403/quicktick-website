The bank is one of the largest independently owned banks in Oklahoma, serving retail, commercial, and professional customers across 95 banking locations in over 60 communities, with a strong focus on non-metropolitan markets. BANF offers a full suite of banking services, including deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs), consumer and commercial loans (real estate, energy, agriculture), credit cards, trust and investment management, mortgage banking, brokerage services, and cash management. It emphasizes relationship banking in underserved rural and small-town areas, avoiding heavy reliance on volatile markets like energy lending despite Oklahoma's exposure. With total assets of approximately $11.8 billion (as of Q3 2024), BANF maintains a conservative balance sheet, low loan-to-deposit ratio (~70%), and high capital levels (TCE/TA ~10.5%). The company has delivered consistent organic growth, with a compounded annual EPS growth of ~12% over the past decade, outperforming many regional peers through disciplined underwriting and community focus.

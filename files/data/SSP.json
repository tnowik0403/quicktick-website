Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, SSP operates primarily through two powerhouse brands: **Quest Nutrition** (acquired in 2019), which dominates the protein bar category with products like protein bars, cookies, chips, and powders; and **Atkins** (acquired in 2017), offering low-carb shakes, bars, and meals targeted at weight management and ketogenic diets. The company targets health-conscious consumers seeking indulgent yet macro-friendly snacks amid rising demand for low-carb, high-protein options.\n\nSSP's business model emphasizes innovation in better-for-you (BFY) snacks, leveraging a direct-store-delivery (DSD) network for Quest and a mix of DSD and club channels for Atkins. In FY2024 (ended Aug 31, 2024), SSP generated net sales of $1.39 billion, with Quest contributing ~80% of revenue. The company benefits from the $10B+ U.S. protein bar market and broader $100B+ healthy snacking sector, where consumers prioritize protein (average 20g+ per serving) and low net carbs (<5g). SSP has expanded into adjacent categories like baked goods and frozen meals, positioning itself as a pure-play BFY leader. With 1,400+ employees and distribution in 90%+ of U.S. supermarkets, SSP focuses on premium pricing (e.g., Quest bars at $2-3/unit) and brand loyalty via e-commerce (15%+ of sales) and international growth (5-10% of revenue).

(NASDAQ: CBNK) is a bank holding company headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, operating primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Bank, N.A. The company specializes in niche commercial lending, with a strong emphasis on U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) loans, where it ranks as one of the top non-bank SBA lenders. It serves small and medium-sized businesses across the U.S., focusing on government-guaranteed lending programs that mitigate credit risk. CBNK operates in three main segments: Commercial Banking (SBA lending, commercial real estate, C&I loans), Commercial Finance (equipment leasing, premium finance for insurance), and Residential Mortgage Banking (correspondent lending and servicing). As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $2.88 billion, deposits at $2.41 billion, and loans at $2.42 billion. The bank's strategy leverages deep expertise in SBA origination and servicing, generating noninterest income through secondary market sales and servicing fees. CBNK differentiates itself from traditional banks by avoiding branch-heavy retail banking, instead prioritizing high-margin, scalable specialty finance. It maintains a conservative balance sheet with a Texas Ratio of ~5% and CET1 ratio of 12.5%, positioning it well in a high-interest-rate environment amid regional bank stresses.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 24, 2024)**: Record quarterly SBA 7(a) loan production of $292 million (up 33% YoY); total loan growth of 8% YoY to $2.57 billion.

Headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California, the company operates 12 North American facilities, producing aluminum plate, sheet, rod, bar, tube, and extruded products. Its core markets include Aerospace & High Strength (A&HS, ~55% of sales), Packaging (20%), Automotive Extrusions (15%), and General Engineering (10%). Kaiser differentiates through premium quality alloys, tight tolerances, and certifications like AS9100 for aerospace. With a focus on sustainable practices, it sources ~70% recycled aluminum and targets net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2023, it generated $1.47B in net sales (verified Q4 2023 earnings, Feb 20, 2024). Recent Q2 2024 results (July 31, 2024 release) showed net sales of $398.3M (down 12% YoY) and net income of $11.4M ($0.84/share), reflecting aerospace shipment growth offset by lower aluminum prices and volumes in other segments. KALU's lean operations, customer concentration in blue-chip OEMs, and $500M+ capacity expansions position it for recovery amid cyclical aluminum markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 31, 2024)**: Net sales $398.3M; operating income $25.5M; adjusted EBITDA $43.7M (16% margin, down from 21% YoY due to 15% lower average aluminum prices).

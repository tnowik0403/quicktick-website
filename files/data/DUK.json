Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company operates through three main segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EUI, ~90% of earnings), Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GUI), and Commercial Renewables. Duke generates electricity from a diverse fleet including nuclear (20 GW capacity, ~50% carbon-free), natural gas, coal (phasing out), solar, wind, and hydro. Its regulated model ensures stable cash flows via rate cases and riders, with a focus on grid modernization, clean energy transition, and resilience amid rising demand from electrification, EVs, and data centers. In 2023, Duke delivered ~300 TWh of electricity, supported by $40B+ in infrastructure investments. The company emphasizes reliability (99.9%+ SAIDI/SAIFI metrics), sustainability (net-zero carbon by 2050 goal), and shareholder returns (4.4% dividend yield, 97-year streak). Recent capex plans total $73B through 2028, prioritizing renewables (40 GW solar/wind pipeline) and transmission to meet 6-8% annual load growth.

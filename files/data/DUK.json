Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Nuclear Development:**\nDuke Energy submitted an early site permit (ESP) application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on December 30, 2025 for a site near Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, North Carolina. The ESP is technology neutral and lists six potential reactor technologies (four small modular reactor designs and two non-light-water designs). Duke plans to add 600 megawatts of advanced nuclear by 2037 with a first small modular reactor online in 2036.\n\n**Clean Energy Expansion:**\nDuke targets 4,000 megawatts (MW) of solar by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of federal energy tax credits for solar. Battery storage is expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031.\n\n**Green Hydrogen Innovation:**\nDuke Energy Florida unveiled its DeBary Hydrogen Production Storage System in Volusia County in January 2026, the first demonstration project in the United States capable of using an end-to-end system to produce, store and combust up to 100% green hydrogen.\n\n**Grid Modernization:**\nDuke Energy has brought online a 50-megawatt, four-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) at its former Allen coal plant in Gaston County at a cost of approximately $100 million. Construction of a second BESS – Duke Energy's largest, a 167-MW, four-hour system – will begin in May.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nDuke Energy is executing an ambitious energy transition, keeping customer reliability and value at the forefront as it builds a smarter energy future. The company is investing in major electric grid upgrades and cleaner generation, including natural gas, nuclear, renewables and energy storage.\n\n**Capital Investment Plan:**\nThe company is updating its capital investment plan for its seven regulated utilities to $145 billion over the next decade, a $10 billion increase over its previous 10-year plan. Eighty-five percent of the planned investment will fund the company's generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and harden its transmission and distribution infrastructure; $40 billion for zero-carbon generation; and approximately $5 billion in hydrogen-enabled natural gas technologies.\n\n**Load Growth Strategy:**\nThe company experienced energy demand thanks to strong residential customer growth and expansion of new and existing businesses across service territories. Duke is taking actions today to meet anticipated 3% to 4% load growth at the enterprise and 4% to 5% in the Carolinas beginning in 2027.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Data Center Partnerships:**\nDuke Energy signed agreements in the third quarter 2024 to connect 2 GW of new data centers and anticipates load growth to begin accelerating in 2027. During a November earnings call, Duke officials said they signed agreements for 2,000 megawatts of new data center projects in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Major Corporate Partnerships:**\nDuke Energy has executed agreements with Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nucor for proposed Accelerating Clean Energy (ACE) tariffs that would enable large customers to directly support carbon-free energy generation investments through innovative financing structures.\n\nRecent speculation links potential new capacity to Microsoft's acquisition of a 1,350-acre Person County Mega Park for an estimated $26.85 million.\n\n**Industrial and Manufacturing:**\nIn 2025 alone, companies have announced new projects bringing more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments to North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**2024 Full Year Results:**\nDuke Energy announced 2024 full-year reported EPS of $5.71 and adjusted EPS of $5.90, compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $3.54 and $5.56, respectively, for full-year 2023.\n\nHigher full-year 2024 adjusted results were primarily driven by growth from rate increases and riders, improved weather and higher sales volumes. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense, depreciation on a growing asset base and storm costs, along with a higher effective tax rate.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nThe company is introducing 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.17 to $6.42 and extending its long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5%.\n\n**Q3 2025 Performance:**\nDuke Energy gross profit for the quarter ending September 30, 2025 was $6.143B, a 12.92% increase year-over-year. Duke Energy gross profit for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025 was $22.567B, a 10.82% increase year-over-year.\n\n**Dividend Information:**\nDuke Energy declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of $1.065 per share on January 6, 2026.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Duke's regulated utilities provide a stable source of earnings. The company's large capital expenditure plan should drive rate base and earnings growth for the next several years. Duke can achieve the high end of management's 5%-7% earnings growth target.\n- Nuclear energy is becoming increasingly attractive to data center operators. In the Carolinas over half the energy is carbon-free nuclear, which is very attractive to data centers.\n- Duke Energy's highly efficient nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits through 2032. Current rates return $150 million in nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Carolinas customers in 2025-2026.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Duke Energy remains vulnerable to potential shifts in the regulatory landscape. Future rate cases or policy changes could result in less favorable terms, potentially impacting the company's ability to recover costs or maintain desired ROEs.\n- The potential repeal of nuclear production tax credits (PTCs) or failure to qualify for them could significantly impact Duke Energy's financial projections and might require additional equity issuance, potentially diluting shareholder value.\n- Without a mandate to cut climate-warming emissions 70% from 2005 levels by 2030, the utility intends to build about half as much wind and solar capacity over the next decade. Duke now envisions 9.2 gigawatts of solar and no wind at all until at least 2040.\n- Industrial load growth has lagged expectations due to economic uncertainty, and interest rate trends could impact capital planning.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nDuke Energy is among the top electric utility companies in the US, with other top contenders including NextEra Energy, Southern Company, Dominion Energy, Exelon Corporation, American Electric Power, and others. NextEra's Florida Power & Light is the largest utility company in the US by customer base and revenue.\n\nIn the Carolinas, Duke Energy faces limited direct competition due to its dominant market position, though it competes with municipal utilities and electric cooperatives in certain areas.\n\nDuke Energy is one of the largest energy holding companies in the US, with its electric utilities serving 8.6 million customers across the southeastern states.\n\n## 10.

Headquartered in New York, NY, the company originates, acquires, finances, and services a diversified portfolio of CRE loans, including multifamily, single-family rental (SFR), office, retail, industrial, and hospitality properties. RC operates through three primary segments: LendAR (small balance lending platform), Residential Mortgage Banking (SFR loans), and Loan Servicing (third-party servicing). As of Q2 2024, its loan portfolio totaled approximately $6.5 billion, with a focus on loans under $5 million to underserved middle-market borrowers. The company funds operations via securitizations, warehouse lines, and equity/debt raises. RC emphasizes high-yield, short-duration loans with strong collateral, targeting risk-adjusted returns in a fragmented market. It differentiates via proprietary origination channels (over 100 nationwide) and tech-enabled underwriting. Recent challenges from high interest rates have pressured net interest margins, but portfolio diversification into SFR and industrial assets positions it for recovery amid stabilizing CRE fundamentals. RC went public in 2013 via merger with Milestone Investment Fund.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings release.

It focuses exclusively on outpatient healthcare real estate, owning a diversified portfolio of 206 properties across 34 U.S. states as of Q2 2024. These assets are primarily leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to a variety of healthcare service providers, including independent living facilities (45% of portfolio), medical office buildings (MOBs, 28%), surgery centers (10%), urgent care centers, physician clinics, and specialty outpatient facilities. CHCT's strategy emphasizes high-credit tenants with investment-grade operators, achieving an occupancy rate of 92.6% as of June 30, 2024. The company generates revenue through rental income, with a focus on value-add acquisitions and selective development. In 2023, it reported total revenues of $109.5 million, benefiting from demographic tailwinds like an aging U.S. population (65+ projected to grow 47% by 2030 per Census Bureau). CHCT differentiates via its niche in non-hospital outpatient properties, avoiding the higher-risk inpatient sector dominated by larger peers.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 30, 2024)**: Reported rental revenues of $27.7 million (up 5.3% YoY), net income of $4.0 million ($0.18/share), FFO of $11.3 million ($0.50/share), AFFO of $11.6 million ($0.52/share).

CEO David Sedgwick emphasized in Q2 call (transcript via Seeking Alpha) focus on \"demographically driven\" markets like Sunbelt states.\n- **Capital Allocation**: 90% equity/debt for growth; recent $100M credit facility upsized (June 2024).\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | High tenant credit quality (top 20 tenants = 40% rent); 7.2-year avg lease term; Sunbelt expansion (60% portfolio). | Elevated payout ratio (150% AFFO); debt maturities $150M by 2026; tenant concentration risk (largest tenant 8%). |\n| **Sector**  | Aging population drives outpatient demand (outpatient visits +15% YoY per CMS 2024 data); shift from inpatient (40% cost savings). | High interest rates (Fed funds 4.75-5%); healthcare reimbursement pressures; election uncertainty (Nov 2024). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Portfolio Breakdown (Q2 2024)**: Independent living (45%, 92 properties), MOBs (28%), surgery/urgent care (27%).\n- **Lease Structure**: Triple-net (tenants pay taxes/insurance/maintenance); avg rent $18.50/sq ft.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Development Pipeline**: Two build-to-suits under construction (Texas and Florida, delivery H1 2025, $25M invested, pre-leased to physicians).\n- **Planned Expansions**: Q3 2024 call previewed three LOIs for 2025 acquisitions totaling $40M in oncology and behavioral health facilities.\n- **Innovation**: Exploring \"healthcare-adjacent\" like wellness centers, per investor day (May 2024).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current Market Share**: ~1-2% of U.S. outpatient healthcare REIT market (total sector AUM ~$50B; CHCT $1.1B gross assets per Q2 2024).\n- **Forecast**: Modest growth to 2-3% by 2026 via 10-15% annual portfolio expansion, outpacing sector avg (3-4% per NAREIT). Tailwinds from niche focus could accelerate if rates fall; risks from competition cap upside.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | CHCT          | NHI (National Health Investors) | OHI (Omega Healthcare) | LTC (LTC Properties) |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Portfolio Focus**       | Outpatient   | SNFs/ALFs                      | SNFs                   | SNFs/ALFs           |\n| **Occupancy**             | 92.6%        | 96%                            | 82%                    | 95%                 |\n| **AFFO/Share Growth YoY** | +2%          | +5%                            | -3%                    | +1%                 |\n| **Debt/EBITDA**           | 5.1x         | 4.8x                           | 6.2x                   | 5.5x                |\n| **Dividend Yield**        | 10.85%       | 6.5%                           | 9.2%                   | 6.8%                |\n| **Edge**                  | Lower risk profile | Scale/diversification          | High yield             | Stable seniors focus|\n\nCHCT trades at discount to peers on P/FFO (sector avg 13x), reflecting smaller size but superior outpatient purity.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Credit facility with five banks (KeyBank lead, June 2024); joint ventures with developers for build-to-suits.\n- **M&A Activity**: 2024 YTD: $50M acquisitions (e.g., September Texas deal); $20M dispositions. No major inbound M&A rumors (per Bloomberg, Oct 2024).\n- **Major Clients (Top Tenants, ~40% ABR)**: Saber Health Group (independent living), various physician groups. Potential: Expansion with Encompass Health (outpatient rehab, LOI discussed Q2 call).\n- **Pipeline Clients**: Behavioral health operators (e.g., Acadia Healthcare talks per online forums).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong (GRESB 2024 score 75/100); solar panels on 10 properties.\n- **Management**: CEO Sedgwick (ex-NHI) track record of 12% IRR since IPO.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish on Reddit/StockTwits (dividend aristocrat potential); analyst consensus \"Hold\" (2 Holds, avg PT $30.50 per TipRanks Oct 2024).\n- **Risks**: Illiquidity (avg daily vol 150K shares); sensitivity to Medicare cuts.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **6/10 (Hold)**  \n  Rationale: Attractive 10.85% yield and outpatient niche provide income stability with moderate growth (4-6% AFFO), but high payout, debt, and rate sensitivity limit upside for growth-focused portfolios. Outperforms in downturns vs. SNF peers.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $32.00/share  \n  (DCF-based: 5% growth to 2028, 8% discount rate, 2.5% terminal yield; 15% upside from $27.82. Moderate risk via diversified tenants offsets macro headwinds.)",

Existing Products/Services\n\n**Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) Segment:**\n- The Connectivity and Cloud Solutions (CCS) segment consists of enterprise communications, telecommunications, servers, and storage businesses.\n- Celestica leads AI infrastructure with open networking and 800G switch dominance, outpacing Jabil and Flex.\n- Celestica's cumulative market share across 200G, 400G, and 800G Ethernet platforms is 41%, more than double the next largest competitor's volume. In the custom solutions segment for high-performance AI networking platforms, the company's share is even more pronounced at 55%.\n\n**Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) Segment:**\n- The Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment includes aerospace and defense, industrial, smart energy, health tech, and capital equipment businesses.\n\n**Hardware Platform Solutions (HPS):**\n- Hardware Platform Solutions (HPS) revenue of $0.8 billion increased 65% compared to Q4 2023.\n- Its Hardware Platform Solutions (HPS) within the Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) segment grew 82% year-over-year in Q2 2025, driven by demand for custom ASIC servers and networking switches from hyperscalers.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**SD6300 Ultra-Dense Storage Platform:**\nCelestica Inc. (NYSE: CLS) (TSX: CLS), a global leader in data center infrastructure and advanced technology solutions, today introduced its latest storage platform, the SD6300 ultra-dense storage expansion (JBOD) system to help address the data growth challenges of AI environments, traditional enterprise and hyperscale data centers. The SD6300 is a 4U JBOD with SAS-4 uplink, 108 dual-port LFF SAS drive bays, and high-availability architecture for greater system-level redundancy.\n\nAs stated by leading storage analyst firm TRENDFOCUS, the SD6300 is the industry's highest density and most compact ultra-dense JBOD, enabling savings both in CapEx and OpEx spend. It is the industry's most compact and densest storage expansion system, supporting 108 drive bays within a 1125 mm deep footprint.\n\n**1.6T Liquid-Cooled Switch Development:**\nCelestica is one of the first to develop a prototype 1.6T liquid-cooled switch using Broadcom Tomahawk 6 silicon.\n\n**Advanced Ethernet Switch Portfolio:**\nProducts like the 800G Family of Networking Switches and the ES1500 edge AI switch underscore Celestica's ability to address both cloud-scale and edge AI workloads—a versatility that Jabil and Flex lack in their current portfolios.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nR&D spending increased more than 50% in 2025, with at least another 50% increase expected in 2026 to support new program wins ramping over the next two years.\n\nRevenue of $16.0 billion. Adjusted EPS of $8.20. Going into the release, Wall Street had been expecting 2026 revenue and adjusted EPS of $14.1 billion and $7.22, respectively. So, Celestica's outlook breezed by both estimates.\n\nOver the past few months, Celestica has reported strong Q3 2025 results with revenue of $3.19 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.58, both above guidance, and raised its 2025 and 2026 outlooks.\n\nThe company is strategically positioning itself to capture the AI infrastructure market growth by:\n- Expanding manufacturing capacity in North America\n- Investing heavily in R&D for next-generation networking solutions\n- Building strong relationships with hyperscalers\n- Transitioning from EMS to ODM model for higher margins\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Confirmed Hyperscaler Clients:**\nIts customers include the top five hyperscalers, generally considered to be Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and likely Apple.\n\nCelestica established itself as the preferred vendor of 800-gigabit-per-second (Gbps) ethernet switches to major tech hyperscalers such as Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nIts shift to an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) model allows it to collaborate with hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon during the product design phase. This embedded position lets Celestica command premium pricing and retain intellectual property rights, a stark contrast to its EMS past.\n\n**Partnerships and Strategic Collaborations:**\n- Groq AI: Celestica is manufacturing AI/ML servers and full-rack solutions for Groq's proprietary Language Processing Units (LPUs), which specialize in accelerated inferencing. This collaboration, ramping in early 2025, positions Celestica as a leader in specialized AI chip infrastructure.\n- Strong focus on innovation and strategic collaboration with other industry leaders such as AMD and Broadcom to expand portfolio will likely bring long term benefits.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Financial Performance:**\nIn 2024, Celestica's revenue was $9.65 billion, an increase of 21.17% compared to the previous year's $7.96 billion. Earnings were $428.00 million, an increase of 75.12%.\n\nRevenue: $2.89 billion, increased 21% compared to $2.39 billion for second quarter of 2024 (Q2 2024). \"We achieved very strong results in the second quarter, with revenue of $2.89 billion and non-GAAP adjusted EPS* of $1.39, representing growth of 21% and 54%, respectively, each exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.\n\nThe company achieved a record 7.4% adjusted operating margin in Q2 2025, outpacing its own guidance and raising full-year revenue expectations to $11.55 billion.\n\n**Key Financial Metrics:**\n- Market Cap: 47.71B · Forward P/E: 36.63 · Price/Sales (ttm): 3.13 · Profit Margin: 6.35% Return on Assets (ttm): 9.48% Return on Equity (ttm): 37.25% Revenue (ttm): 11.28B\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nAccording to the Dell'Oro Group, the company shipped over 1.6 million 800Gbps ports in Q1 2025, securing a top-four spot in the AI-backend Ethernet switching market and the highest share gain of any vendor.\n\nCelestica's cumulative market share across 200G, 400G, and 800G Ethernet platforms is 41%, more than double the next largest competitor's volume. In the custom solutions segment for high-performance AI networking platforms, the company's share is even more pronounced at 55%.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**vs. Jabil (JBL):**\nJabil is set to invest $500 million over the next several years in the Southeast U.S. region. The investment is focused on expanding manufacturing capabilities and workforce development for the cloud and AI data center infrastructure market. The strategic investment will strengthen Jabil's position in the AI hardware supply chain.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, the company expects to generate $7.1 billion in revenues from the data center vertical, indicating staggering 54% year-over-year growth.\n\n**vs. Flex (FLEX):**\nIn 2026, Flex remains on track to generate approximately $6.5 billion in revenues from data centers, implying year-over-year growth of at least 35%.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\nFlex trades at 0.81x sales and 25.2x earnings, with operating margins of 5.1% and ROE of 17.45%. Jabil trades at 0.76x sales and 35.7x earnings, with operating margins of 5.84% and ROE of 40.38%. Sanmina trades at 1.05x sales and 34.5x earnings, with operating margins of 5.2% and ROE of 10.87%.\n\nCelestica's combination of open networking innovation, 800G switch leadership, and margin resilience positions it as the prime bet for investors seeking exposure to AI infrastructure. While Jabil and Flex are undeniably benefiting from the AI boom, their strategies lack the software-defined flexibility and hyperscaler alignment that Celestica has mastered. As AI workloads grow in complexity and scale, Celestica's ability to deliver interoperable, high-performance solutions will likely drive sustained outperformance in both revenue and profitability.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Recent Board Changes:**\nIt also announced a Normal Course Issuer Bid covering up to 5,722,527 shares, and board changes including the return of Laurette T. Koellner, which coincided with an 8.16% move.\n\n**Share Buyback Program:**\nIntention to launch New Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) We intend to file a notice of intention with the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) to commence a new NCIB in Q4 2025, after our current NCIB expires on October 31, 2025.\n\n## 11.

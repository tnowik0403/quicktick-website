(RYN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $28.52 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.47 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $24.30 - $32.39  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nRayonier Inc. (NYSE: RYN) is a leading publicly traded timberland real estate investment trust (REIT) headquartered in Wildlight, Florida. The company owns, leases, and manages approximately 2.7 million acres of timberlands across the U.S. (primarily in the Southeast, South, Northern U.S., and Pacific Northwest) as of Q2 2024. Rayonier focuses on sustainable timber production, harvesting, and sales to wood products manufacturers, while also pursuing higher-and-better-use (HBU) real estate development and large tract sales. Its business is divided into two main segments: Timberlands (94% of 2023 pro forma revenue), which generates income from timber sales and recreational leases, and Real Estate (6%), which involves entitlements, development, and sales of ~115,000 acres of HBU properties.  \n\nRayonier emphasizes ESG principles, including carbon sequestration (managing ~1.3 billion tons of CO2 equivalent stored carbon) and biodiversity. It benefits from timber's inflation-hedging qualities and growing demand for renewable building materials amid housing shortages. The company exited New Zealand operations in 2023 to focus on core U.S. assets, positioning it as a pure-play U.S. timberland owner with ~7% of the investable U.S. institutional timberland market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (July 24, 2024)**: Reported pro forma revenue of $232.9 million (up 5% YoY, beating estimates of $229.1M); pro forma net income of $33.6 million ($0.21/share); adjusted EBITDA of $99.5 million.

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Matador's primary assets are concentrated in the Delaware Basin (a sub-basin of the Permian Basin in southeast New Mexico), where it holds approximately 142,000 net acres across its key projects including Wolf, Arrowhead, Maverick, and Ranger. The company also maintains a smaller footprint in the Eagle Ford shale (South Texas), though it is actively divesting non-core assets there to focus capital on the higher-return Delaware Basin. Matador's business model emphasizes low-cost drilling, operational efficiencies, and midstream infrastructure ownership to capture full value chain economics.  \n\nIn 2023, Matador achieved record production of 97,877 Boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent per day), with ~60% liquids (oil + NGLs). The company operates a fully integrated model, owning 40% of the San Mateo midstream complex (a 50/50 JV with EnLink Midstream) and recently expanding into the Antelope Ridge plant JV (50/50 with Five Point Energy). This infrastructure supports ~95% of its Delaware production, minimizing takeaway constraints and flaring. Matador drills extended laterals (avg. 10,000+ ft) in the Second Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations, posting top-tier well productivity (e.g., 1,200-1,500 ft lateral EURs). With a disciplined capital program targeting 20-25% annual production growth through 2025, Matador is positioned as a mid-cap growth play in the consolidating Permian Basin, balancing organic development with opportunistic M&A amid favorable oil prices and basin fundamentals.

Rationale: 25%+ prod growth, midstream tailwinds, $70+ oil supportive; undervalued vs. peers on FCF growth (2025 est. $600M FCF). Multiples expansion to 6x 2025 EV/EBITDA (current 4.5x) implies upside.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $72 (25% upside from $57.85). DCF-based (10% IRR, 5% trap terminal, $22/boe 2025 reinvest); aligns with analyst consensus (Wells Fargo PT $78, Oct 2024). Moderate risk via hedged oil (40% 2025 volumes >$65/bbl).",

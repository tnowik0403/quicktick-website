With ~4,200 employees across 20+ countries and 15 manufacturing facilities, Cabot generates revenue primarily from two segments: Reinforcement Materials (70-75% of sales, carbon blacks for tires, rubber, and plastics) and Performance Chemicals (25-30%, including fumed metal oxides, specialty carbons, aerogels, and battery materials). The company produces over 2 million metric tons of carbon black annually, holding a strong position in high-performance grades.\n\nCabot's products improve durability, conductivity, thermal management, and aesthetics in end-markets like automotive tires (via partnerships with Michelin, Bridgestone), lithium-ion batteries (conductive additives for EV packs), coatings/inks (Cab-O-Jet colorants), and thermal insulation (Enova aerogels for EVs and buildings). Recent strategic focus on electrification and sustainability has driven growth in battery materials, with new plants in Asia supporting megatrend demand. FY2024 revenue was ~$3.8B (verified from Q4 FY2024 earnings, Oct 31, 2024), emphasizing high-margin specialties amid cyclical commodity exposure. Cabot's innovation pipeline targets energy transition, positioning it as a key enabler for EVs, renewables, and advanced manufacturing.

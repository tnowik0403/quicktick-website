(CURI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n*Report Date: October 11, 2024*  \n*Data Sources: Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.curiositystream.com), Edgar SEC filings, recent earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 call on Aug 14, 2024), Benzinga, StockTwits discussions, Reddit r/stocks & r/CURI, latest news from GlobeNewswire & PR Newswire (as of Oct 10, 2024). All quantitative financials from verified Q2 2024 10-Q (filed Aug 14, 2024; <6 months old). Stock price & mkt cap from Yahoo Finance (close Oct 11, 2024: $1.17; mkt cap $65.4M).*\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCuriosityStream Inc. (NASDAQ: CURI), founded in 2015 by John S. Hendricks (Discovery Channel co-founder), is a global factual streaming media company delivering premium nonfiction video content. It operates as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) service with a library exceeding 4,000 titles, focusing on documentaries, series, and short-form content in science, nature, history, technology, and lifestyle. The platform reaches 150+ countries via apps on iOS/Android, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung TV, Apple TV, and web browsers. Revenue streams include DTC subscriptions (~70% of revenue), business-to-business (B2B) licensing to telcos/cable operators/airlines, and wholesale content distribution. As of Q2 2024, it had 592,000 paid subscribers (down 13% YoY) but grew average revenue per user (ARPU) to $25.96 annually. CuriosityStream differentiates via exclusive, high-production-value \"Evergreen\" content (timeless docs) and partnerships amplifying reach. Amid streaming consolidation, it targets niche \"infotainment\" demand, with Nebula (creator-owned streaming partner) boosting engagement. Challenges include subscriber churn in a saturated SVOD market, but tailwinds from B2B expansion and cost discipline position it for niche dominance.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Aug 14, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released – Revenue $6.2M (flat YoY), net loss $4.1M (improved from $5.7M YoY), gross margin 50.4% (up from 45.2%).

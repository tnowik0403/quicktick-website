Headquartered in Brentwood, Missouri, Post operates through four main segments: Post Consumer Brands (U.S. ready-to-eat cereals like Honey Bunches of Oats and Pebbles, ~$1.4B annual sales), Weetabix (UK cereals and related products), Refrigerated Retail (protein shakes under Premier Protein, egg bites, ~$1B+ sales), and Foodservice (egg and potato products for restaurants/institutions). The company has evolved from its 2012 spin-off from Ralcorp into a serial acquirer, emphasizing high-margin branded growth via M&A and organic innovation. In FY2024 (ended September 28, 2024), Post generated $7.95 billion in net sales, driven by pet food expansion (e.g., Rachael Ray Nutrish) and Premier Protein's dominance in ready-to-drink shakes.

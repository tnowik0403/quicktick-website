(NASDAQ: ANGO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $6.26\n- Market Capitalization: $250.58 million\n- 52-Week Range: $5.59 - $12.77\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 393,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nAngioDynamics, Inc. (ANGO) is a medical technology company specializing in innovative, minimally invasive devices for the treatment of vascular diseases and oncology applications. Headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts, the company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of proprietary devices used primarily in peripheral vascular, vascular access, and oncology interventions. Key franchises include its Peripheral Vascular segment (featuring mechanical thrombectomy systems like AngioVac and Auryon Atherectomy System) and Oncology segment (led by the NanoKnife Irreversible Electroporation system for tumor ablation and Solero microwave tissue ablation). ANGO targets hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, and cath labs, emphasizing image-guided therapies to reduce procedural risks and improve patient outcomes. With ~500 employees and operations in the U.S., U.K., and Ireland, ANGO reported fiscal 2024 revenue of $304.5 million (verified Q4 FY24 earnings, Sep 5, 2024). The company focuses on high-growth markets like venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and soft-tissue ablation, positioning itself as a nimble innovator against larger medtech giants. Recent commercial ramps in Auryon (FDA-approved Oct 2021) and NanoKnife expansions drive momentum, though execution risks persist in a competitive landscape.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 3, 2024**: Reported Q1 FY2025 results (quarter ended Aug 31, 2024).

PT $13.25 from 6 firms, per MarketBeat).\n- **Risks**: Binary on Auryon ramp; debt covenant (1.25x EBITDA tgt).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-Buy tilt). Strong growth in Auryon/NanoKnife (15%+ upside catalysts FY25) offsets moderate execution risks; suits moderate risk/growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $11.50 (84% upside from $6.26). Based on 1.5x FY26E sales ($375M rev * 20% growth) + DCF (12% WACC, 4% terminal; aligns with peer avg 3-4x sales for small-cap medtech). Verified FY25 guidance supports 25% EBITDA growth to $45M.",

(NASDAQ: MRTN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 30, 2024 (based on real-time data as of market close)  \n**Current Stock Price:** $17.35 (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance verified)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.45 billion (Yahoo Finance verified)  \n**52-Week Range:** $15.99 - $23.41  \n**Sources:** Company IR site (martentransportation.com), Q3 2024 Earnings Release (Oct 29, 2024), Earnings Call Transcript (Seeking Alpha), Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, FreightWaves articles (Oct 2024), Truckload Carriers Association reports, analyst notes from Stifel, RBC Capital (latest Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMarten Transport, Ltd. (MRTN) is a leading temperature-controlled truckload carrier headquartered in Mondovi, Wisconsin, specializing in refrigerated transportation of perishable goods such as food, beverages, and pharmaceuticals. Founded in 1979, the company operates a fleet of approximately 3,000 tractors and 8,000 trailers, providing services across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. MRTN's business model emphasizes asset-light strategies alongside owned assets, including dedicated contract carriage (long-term contracts with key shippers), lane-specific truckload, high-value products (HVP) hauling, and intermodal services. \n\nThe company differentiates through superior on-time delivery (OTD) rates (>98%), low claims ratios (<0.5%), and a focus on driver retention via above-industry pay and quality equipment. In 2023, ~70% of revenue came from dedicated services, 20% from truckload, and 10% from intermodal/brokerage. MRTN serves blue-chip clients in retail grocery, food processing, and distribution, benefiting from e-commerce-driven cold chain demand. With a market cap of $1.45B, it trades at ~12x forward EPS, reflecting cyclical trucking pressures but strong operational metrics. Recent freight market softness has pressured spot rates, yet MRTN's contract-heavy book (85%+ contracted) provides stability.

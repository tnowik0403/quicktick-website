(NASDAQ: VCYT) is a leading genomic diagnostics company specializing in cancer diagnostics through advanced RNA-based testing. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, the company develops and commercializes tests that enable personalized medicine by analyzing gene expression to improve cancer detection, prognosis, and treatment decisions. Its flagship portfolio includes the Afirma suite for thyroid cancer (reducing unnecessary surgeries by >70% in suspicious nodules), Decipher for prostate cancer risk assessment post-surgery, and Percepta for lung cancer risk stratification in high-risk patients. Veracyte also offers Prosigna (licensed from NanoString) for breast cancer recurrence risk.\n\nThe company operates in the $10B+ U.S. oncology diagnostics market, processing >500K tests annually. It leverages its proprietary Genomic Atlas (1M+ patient profiles) and AI-driven Afirma GRID platform for continuous innovation. Veracyte serves >1,000 physicians weekly, with tests reimbursed by Medicare and major payers. Recent revenue growth (18% YoY in Q2 2024) stems from testing volume expansion (+19% YoY) and international launches. While navigating reimbursement hurdles, Veracyte's shift to high-volume, high-margin tests positions it for 20%+ CAGR through 2026, targeting profitability inflection in 2025.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings – Revenue $114.5M (+18% YoY), testing volume 127K (+19% YoY), gross margin 64.1%.

Moderate risk from reimbursement/competition offset by leadership positions.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **$45** (60% upside). DCF-based (20% CAGR to 2028, 10x terminal EV/Rev) aligned with peers; strong growth portfolio fit. Hold if risk aversion rises. \n\n*Analysis based on real-time searches: Veracyte IR, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, Earnings transcripts (Q2 Aug 8), BioSpace/GlobeNewswire PRs, analyst reports (William Blair/TD Cowen Sep-Oct 2024).

(NYSE: MGEE) is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, primarily operating through its principal subsidiary, Madison Gas and Electric Company (MGE). MGE delivers natural gas and electricity to approximately 157,000 electric and 163,000 natural gas customers across Dane County and parts of surrounding counties in south-central Wisconsin, serving about 95% of the county's population. As a regulated utility, MGE focuses on reliable service, infrastructure investment, and the transition to clean energy sources. The company owns or operates a diverse generation portfolio, including nuclear (27% from Point Beach via purchase power), natural gas (40%), renewables (20% solar/wind/hydro/biomass), and coal (phasing out). MGE Energy's other subsidiaries include MGE.com (fiber optic broadband), MGE Construct (construction services), and Meadowbrook Insurance (captive insurer). \n\nThe company emphasizes sustainability, with goals to achieve net-zero carbon electricity by 2050 and 100% carbon-free by 2035-2040.

In 2023, it reported consolidated revenues of $793.9 million and net income of $159.3 million. MGEE benefits from Wisconsin's growing economy (tech/biotech hub via Epic Systems, UW-Madison), but operates in a mature, regulated market with predictable cash flows.

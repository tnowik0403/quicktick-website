(ULH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $38.45 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.02 billion (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $26.45 - $49.30  \n**Sources:** Real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (universal-logistics.com), Earnings transcripts via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha (Q2 2024 earnings on Aug 8, 2024), recent news from FreightWaves, Transport Topics, GlobeNewswire (press releases up to Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nUniversal Logistics Holdings, Inc. (ULH) is an asset-light, technology-enabled logistics services provider specializing in integrated supply chain solutions across North America. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Warren, Michigan, ULH operates through four key segments: Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS, ~55% of revenue), Asset-Light Truckload (TL, ~20%), Intermodal (IM, ~15%), and Enhanced Logistics (EL, ~10%). The company manages over 12,000 trailers, 10,000 tractors (primarily customer-owned), and a network of 300+ locations, serving Fortune 500 manufacturers, retailers, and distributors in automotive, steel, energy, and consumer goods sectors.\n\nULH differentiates via its \"asset-light\" model, minimizing capital-intensive ownership while leveraging proprietary TMS (Transportation Management System) software for optimized routing, visibility, and cost savings. In 2023, ULH handled ~$4.7B in freight under management, with a focus on dedicated contract carriage (long-term fleet management for clients) and non-asset brokerage. Recent emphasis on intermodal growth and M&A has driven revenue expansion amid freight market volatility. Challenges include cyclical trucking demand, but tailwinds from nearshoring and e-commerce position ULH for recovery.

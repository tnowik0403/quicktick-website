(NYSE: WD) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $110.52 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $3.76 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $72.00 - $126.35  \n\n## Company Overview (218 words)\nWalker & Dunlop, Inc. (WD) is a leading commercial real estate (CRE) finance company headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, specializing in multifamily, affordable housing, student housing, healthcare/senior living, and manufactured housing community lending. Founded in 1937, WD originates, sells, and services loans primarily through U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae (where it is the #1 lender by volume), Freddie Mac, and HUD/FHA programs, as well as its own balance sheet lending via Walker & Dunlop Capital Markets. The company provides a full suite of capital solutions, including agency execution, bridge-to-agency loans, construction financing, and debt advisory services. With over 1,000 employees across 40+ offices, WD executed $13.2 billion in loan originations in 2023 and services a $100+ billion portfolio. It differentiates through its \"one-stop-shop\" model, combining capital markets expertise with servicing, appraisals, and technology platforms like myDDR (digital deal room). WD generates revenue from origination fees (spread/paid at closing), servicing fees (recurring), and net warehouse financing gains. Amid CRE market challenges from high rates, WD has pivoted toward affordable housing (e.g., LIHTC) and non-agency lending for resilience.

Founded in 1956 and headquartered in New York City, the company operates a low-capital-intensive licensing model, generating ~80% of revenue from third-party intellectual property. Key licenses include Calvin Klein (since 1997), Tommy Hilfiger (since 2005), DKNY (since 2013), Kenneth Cole (since 2009), and Log Cabin (acquired licenses). Proprietary brands include G.III Leather Fashions, Ivan Ground, William Raglan, and Eliza J. G-III sells to ~9,000 retailers worldwide, including Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Amazon, and international wholesalers, with a focus on women's and men's apparel (outerwear ~50% of sales). FY2024 revenue was $3.08 billion, emphasizing wholesale distribution (98% of sales) over direct-to-consumer. The company benefits from royalty-free licensing (pays royalties on sales), enabling scalable growth without heavy R&D/marketing spend. Recent strategic shifts include digital expansion, international growth (Europe/Asia ~20% of sales), and owned brand investments amid department store challenges.

International share +3-5ppt via Europe push.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 FY25) | GIII          | VF Corp (VFC) | PVH Corp (PVH) | Columbia (COLM) |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Revenue**               | $3.08B       | $10.5B       | $9.2B         | $3.4B        |\n| **Gross Margin**          | 32.5% (Q2)   | 52%          | 56%           | 49%          |\n| **Op.

Bass shoes acquisition). Speculation on bolt-on licenses (Seeking Alpha Oct 2024).\n- **Current Major Clients:** Macy's (~20% sales), Kohl's (15%), Nordstrom (10%), Amazon (8%), Walmart (5%).\n- **Potential Clients:** Shein/Temu collaborations rumored (online chatter); European expansion targets Zalando, Boohoo.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Improving (20% sustainable fabrics FY2025); B+ MSCI rating.\n- **Analyst Sentiment:** 7 Buys/4 Holds/1 Sell (Yahoo Finance Oct 10); avg. PT $32.50.\n- **Online Buzz:** Reddit/StockTwits neutral-bullish post-earnings (inventory wins); short interest 8% (down from 12%).\n- **Risks:** License non-renewal (Tommy 2026), retail bankruptcies (e.g., potential Macy's distress).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Earnings miss reflects cyclical wholesale weakness, but FY25 guidance implies 10-20% EPS growth, inventory deleveraging, and license expansions support recovery. Moderate risk from retail exposure balanced by $0 debt and 3x FCF yield.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $34.00 (30% upside from $26.24). Based on 8x FY26E EBITDA ($140M implied) + 20% premium for licensing moat (comps-adjusted DCF; aligns with analyst avg. PT). Suited for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns over 12-18 months.",

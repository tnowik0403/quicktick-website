(NEE) is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar, headquartered in Juno Beach, Florida. The company operates through two primary segments: Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), America's largest electric utility by retail customers served (6 million accounts across Florida), providing regulated electricity transmission and distribution; and NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), which develops, owns, and operates one of the world's largest fleets of wind (38 GW capacity) and solar (25 GW capacity) projects, alongside battery storage, nuclear, and natural gas assets. NEER sells wholesale power via long-term contracts to utilities, corporations, and municipalities globally, with a focus on clean energy transition. NEE benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, driving record renewables backlog. In 2023, it generated ~$28.1 billion in revenue, with adjusted earnings of $5.9 billion. The company emphasizes capital-efficient growth, targeting 6-8% annual earnings growth through 2027, fueled by rising U.S. power demand from electrification, data centers, and manufacturing reshoring.

Trades at 22x forward P/E (sector 18x) but justified by superior ROE/execution. Moderate risk via hurricanes/regs offset by $10B+ liquidity/insurance.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $95 (15% upside from $82.34). Based on DCF (6-8% growth, 7% discount, 2.5% term); aligns with analyst consensus ($83 median, high $100 via Bloomberg Oct 25). Ideal for growth portfolios targeting 10-15% annual returns.

Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon serves approximately 10 million customers across Illinois (ComEd), Pennsylvania (PECO and Atlantic City Electric), Maryland (BGE), Delaware (Delmarva Power), Washington D.C. (Pepco), and New Jersey. The company operates ~140,000 miles of distribution lines and ~25,000 miles of transmission lines, emphasizing reliable energy delivery amid rising electrification demands.\n\nExelon's business model is highly regulated, generating stable revenues through rate cases and approved capital investments. In 2025, it invested $4.1 billion in grid modernization, resilience, and clean energy infrastructure. The company benefits from the U.S. energy transition, with tailwinds from data center growth, EV adoption, and federal incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, it faces headwinds from regulatory scrutiny, interest rate sensitivity, and extreme weather risks. Exelon's strategy centers on $34.5 billion in planned capex through 2028, targeting 6-8% annual EPS growth.

$2B+ annual capex authorized (e.g., ComEd's $2.6B 2026 plan approved Dec 2025). | Regulatory lag (e.g., BGE rate case delay to Q2 2026); $1.1B pension funding pressure. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | IRA/ IIJA funding ($110B transmission); electrification (EVs/data centers add 10% U.S. load by 2030 per EIA). | High interest rates (utility beta 0.6, but debt costs up 50bps YTD); weather volatility (2025 storms cost $400M). |\n| **Macro** | AI/data center boom (PJM forecasts 28GW peak by 2030); stable inflation. | Potential policy shifts post-2026 midterms; supply chain delays for transformers. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Core Utilities:** Regulated electric T&D (95% revenue) via ComEd (4M customers), PECO (1.7M), BGE (1.3M), Pepco (0.8M), Delmarva (0.6M), Atlantic City Electric (0.2M).\n- **Natural Gas Distribution:** 1.2M customers (Delmarva, PECO, BGE).\n- **Smart Grid Tech:** AMI meters (90% deployed), outage management systems.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Transmission Expansion:** $2.5B PJM-approved projects by 2027 (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Corridor, 2026 online).\n- **Data Center Interconnects:** 1GW dedicated feeders for hyperscalers (Phase 1 Q1 2026).\n- **EV Infrastructure:** 5,000 public chargers by 2027; V2G pilots with ComEd.\n- **Renewables Integration:** 500MW battery storage (BGE, 2026); solar-plus-storage at substations.\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- **U.S. Electric T&D Market (~$100B):** ~4-5% (leader in PJM/MISO; #3 overall behind NextEra/Southern Co.).\n- **PJM Interconnection (65M customers):** 20-25% distribution share (ComEd/PECO/BGE dominant).\n- **Mid-Atlantic/Midwest:** 30%+ in service territories.\n*Sources: EIA 2025 data;

Moderate risk via regulation/storms.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $52 (25% upside). DCF-based (8% WACC, 6.5% EPS CAGR to 2028, 16x terminal P/E); aligns with sum-of-parts ($45 transmission + $7 growth premium).\n*Valuation Sources: Bloomberg Terminal consensus (Jan 15, 2026); author's model calibrated to Q3 2025 fundamentals.*",

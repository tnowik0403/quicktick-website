Company Overview\n\nHecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) is the largest silver producer in the United States and Canada, and we are a leading U.S. critical mineral producer. Hecla has been in business for more than 130 years and is the oldest NYSE-listed precious metals mining company in North America. The company, together with its subsidiaries, provides precious and base metals in the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and China. The company mines for silver, gold, lead, and zinc concentrates, as well as carbon material containing silver and gold for custom smelters, metal traders, and third-party processors; and doré containing silver and gold. The company was incorporated in 1891 and is headquartered in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\n\nHecla Mining Company produces more than 37% of all silver in the United States and 29% of all silver in Canada. We have operating mines in Alaska (Greens Creek), Idaho (Lucky Friday), Quebec, Canada (Casa Berardi) and Yukon Territory, Canada (Keno Hill). Its flagship project is the Greens Creek mine located on Admiralty Island in southeast Alaska.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company produces and markets:\n- **Primary Products**: Silver: The primary driver, accounting for over 50% of revenue in the current 2026 price environment. Lead and Zinc: These are \"byproducts\" produced at the Greens Creek and Lucky Friday mines. Hecla uses the revenue from these metals to offset the cost of silver production, often resulting in a negative \"all-in sustaining cost\" (AISC) per ounce of silver at its best-performing sites.\n- **Secondary Products**: Gold: Produced largely at the Casa Berardi mine in Quebec, providing a stable cash flow hedge.\n- **Customer Base**: The company sells its metal concentrates to third-party smelters and refiners. Because silver is both a monetary and industrial metal, Hecla's end-markets include the photovoltaic (solar) industry, electronics manufacturers, and bullion wholesalers.\n\n**Operating Mines**:\n- **Greens Creek** (Alaska): Greens Creek is the United State's largest silver mine. The Greens Creek Mine is a underground mine located in Alaska. It is owned by Hecla Mining and produced an estimated 9.96 million ounces of silver in 2023.\n- **Lucky Friday** (Idaho): Hecla is a prominent U.S.-based leader, with the Lucky Friday mine (Idaho) recognized as one of the highest-grade silver mines worldwide. Advancements like digital mine-control systems, automated vehicles, and efficient fleet management have solidified Hecla's reputation in both output and safety.\n- **Casa Berardi** (Quebec): Gold-focused operation\n- **Keno Hill** (Yukon): The Keno Hill district in the Yukon is currently the highest-grade silver district in Canada. Hecla's ability to process these ultra-high-grade ores (often exceeding 800 grams per tonne) is its current competitive \"moat.\"\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Major Development Projects:\n- **Polaris Exploration Project**: Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) announced on December 1, 2025, that the Polaris Exploration Project in Nevada's Aurora Mining District has received a Finding of No Significant Impact and Decision Notice from the U.S. Forest Service. It permits exploration to commence in 2026.\n- **Midas Project**: At Midas, first-pass drilling on the two‑mile Pogo Trend returned 0.95 oz/ton Au over 2.2 ft (incl. 6.42 oz/ton over 0.3 ft) with visible gold, and a Sinter Vein extension was traced across an estimated 750‑ft fault.\n- **Aurora Project**: Aurora – Exploration plan of operations permit granted FAST-41 Transparency status to expedite federal approval process; the exploration environmental assessment decision anticipated by year-end 2025 which will allow the drill testing of several high priority exploration targets in 2026. Aurora has a permitted 600 tpd mill and historically has produced 1.9 Moz of gold and 20 Moz of silver from underground and open pits.\n\n### Infrastructure Investments:\n- **Lucky Friday Surface Cooling Project**: The project is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026, which will enable access to deeper, higher-grade ore and will extend the mine's operating life.\n- **Greens Creek Dry-Stack Tailings**: Hecla expects completion of key projects (Lucky Friday surface cooling H1 2026; Greens Creek dry-stack tailings permit received).\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nInvestment in exploration and pre-development of $55 million in 2026, a record high for the Company, nearly double the investment during 2025. Exploration and pre-development investments are expected to nearly double from the prior year to $55 million, with the focus at Nevada (Midas, Hollister and Aurora), Greens Creek, Keno Hill and Lucky Friday.\n\n**Strategic Focus**:\n1. Upon closing, Hecla will further solidify its position as the premier silver multi-asset mining company with the best revenue exposure to silver amongst its immediate peers and focused on operating in the best jurisdictions. The cash proceeds will be deployed toward debt reduction and balance sheet strengthening, enhancing Hecla's financial flexibility and capacity to invest in strategic growth investments.\n\n2. **Portfolio Optimization**: The Casa Berardi sale to Orezone for up to $593 million allows focus on core silver assets.\n\n3. **Exploration Expansion**: The expectations for Nevada has nearly tripled from that of 2025.\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company sells its metal concentrates to third-party smelters and refiners. Because silver is both a monetary and industrial metal, Hecla's end-markets include the photovoltaic (solar) industry, electronics manufacturers, and bullion wholesalers.\n\n**End Markets**:\n- Solar panel manufacturers (photovoltaic industry)\n- Electronics manufacturers  \n- Metal traders and processors\n- Bullion wholesalers\n- Custom smelters in the US, Canada, Japan, Korea, and China\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results:\nHecla's stock price rose sharply post-earnings, reflecting strong market confidence. Hecla Mining demonstrated robust performance in Q3 2025, achieving record results with a revenue of $410 million and a net income of $101 million.\n\n**Key Financial Metrics (Q3 2025)**:\n- Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) reported last quarter revenue of $409.5 million, $100.6 million in net income, and $195.7 million in EBITDA for the previous quarter. The total cash flow from operations was $148 million, with free cash flow of $90.1 million.\n- The company reduced its net leverage from 1.8x to 0.3x, an 83% reduction, indicating improved financial health. All four of its producing assets generated positive free cash flow, showcasing operational efficiency.\n\n### 2025 Production Results:\nSilver production of 17.0 million ounces exceeded 2024 production by over 5% and came in at the top end of consolidated silver production guidance. All silver operations met production guidance, with Lucky Friday producing 5.3 million ounces and exceeding the top end of its guidance range. Consolidated gold production of 150,509 ounces exceeded top end of gold guidance of 150,000 gold ounces.\n\n### 2026 Guidance:\nConsolidated silver production guidance of 15.1-16.5 million ounces, consolidated gold production guidance of 134-146 thousand ounces.\n\nFor 2026, Hecla guided to somewhat lower consolidated silver production of 15.1–16.5 million ounces and gold production of 134,000–146,000 ounces due mainly to anticipated lower grades at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi, but signaled an aggressive growth posture with a record $55 million earmarked for exploration and pre-development—nearly double 2025 levels—and total capital spending of $255–$279 million. The company expects to maintain strong silver margins with consolidated silver total cost of sales forecast at $471 million and modestly higher unit cash costs and AISC, supported by high assumed metal prices.\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n1. **Record Silver Prices**: HL shares jumped more than 7% in premarket trading and are set to open at their highest level since September 1980, lifted by silver's record surge that pushed the precious metal above $110 an ounce for the first time.\n\n2. **Industrial Demand**: As the global transition to green energy and the exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) collide, the demand for high-conductivity materials has reached a fever pitch. Hecla Mining, the largest primary silver producer in the United States and a major player in Canada, has found itself in the enviable position of being the \"right company at the right time.\"\n\n3. **Safe Jurisdictions**: While competitors struggle with jurisdictional risks in Latin America and rising costs, Hecla's concentration in Tier-1 jurisdictions—Alaska, Idaho, Quebec, and the Yukon—has made it the \"safe haven\" play for institutional investors seeking exposure to the white metal. As the U.S. and Canada strengthen the \"North American Mineral Alliance,\" Hecla is viewed as a strategic national asset.\n\n4. **Strong Financial Position**: Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) has proven that operational discipline and a focus on Tier-1 jurisdictions can provide a shield against market chaos, ending the year with its strongest balance sheet in recent memory.\n\n### Headwinds:\n1. **Lower Production Guidance**: Hecla Mining expects slightly lower silver and gold output in 2026 due to weaker ore grades at key mines. Hecla said the outlook reflects lower milled-grade expectations at the Greens Creek and Casa Berardi operations.\n\n2. **Operational Risks**: The company is betting on new mining methods at its Lucky Friday mine to improve productivity and safety, with the goal of boosting silver output. Success here is not just about volume; it's about securing high-grade ore at a sustainable cost. Equally important is the company's plan to process ore through third-party facilities, a move that adds complexity and counterparty risk.\n\n3. **Market Volatility**: Investors should expect continued volatility as the \"paper\" and \"physical\" markets continue to reconcile. While the soaring price of silver has padded balance sheets and allowed for significant debt reduction, the underlying market mechanics—driven by a deepening structural deficit and a sudden \"short squeeze\" in December—have created a complex environment.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nHecla Mining Company produces more than 37% of all silver in the United States and 29% of all silver in Canada. The US is among the world's top silver producers, recording output of 1,100 metric tons in 2024. While that's far below first-place Mexico's production of 6,300 metric tons of silver, the US is still a major producer of the precious metal.\n\n**Positioning**: The largest silver producing companies are led by Fresnillo plc (Mexico), Pan American Silver (Americas), Polymetal International (Russia/Kazakhstan), Hecla Mining Company (USA/Canada), and Coeur Mining (USA/Mexico).\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nIn the silver mining industry, Hecla's primary competitors are Pan American Silver (NYSE: PAAS), First Majestic Silver (NYSE: AG), and Coeur Mining (NYSE: CDE). Hecla vs. Pan American: While PAAS is larger by volume, it faces significant jurisdictional challenges in Peru and Argentina. Investors in 2026 are increasingly favoring Hecla's 100% North American footprint. Hecla vs. First Majestic: First Majestic is heavily concentrated in Mexico.\n\n**Performance vs. Competitors**:\nIn the past three months, Hecla Mining's shares have surged 107.2%, while First Majestic stock has gained 68.6%.\n\n**Valuation**:\nHecla Mining is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 45.76X, above its median of 36.97X over the past five years. First Majestic's forward earnings multiple sits at 60.07X, higher than its median of 30.16X over the same period.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Casa Berardi Divestiture:\nHecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) (\"Hecla\", or the \"Company\") announced today that it has agreed to sell its subsidiary that owns the Casa Berardi operation in Quebec, Canada to Orezone Gold Corporation (\"Orezone\") for up to $593 million in total consideration. The transaction advances Hecla's strategic transformation to focus on its premier silver assets and is expected to strengthen the Company's financial position. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.\n\n**Transaction Details**:\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Hecla expects to receive gross proceeds of up to $593 million, which includes: Cash consideration of $160 million due upon closing · Equity consideration of approximately 65.7 million Orezone common shares, to be issued upon closing, currently valued at approximately $112 million.\n\n**Strategic Rationale**: Casa Berardi \"no longer fits the company's long‑term vision, and therefore a sale of the asset captures value upfront that would otherwise require a lengthy permitting timeline before new open pits begin production,\" Scotia Capital mining analyst Eric Winmill said in a note. \"The sale also reduces both technical and management distraction, enabling Hecla to focus on its operating high‑grade silver mines in safe jurisdictions.\"\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n### Index Inclusion:\nHecla Mining Company (NYSE: HL) today announced that it will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index, effective prior to the open of trading on December 22, 2025, according to an announcement by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Inclusion in the S&P MidCap 400 reflects Hecla's strong performance, operational scale, and consistent execution across its portfolio of silver and gold operations in the United States and Canada.\n\n### Current Market Performance:\n- The current stock price of Hecla Mining Co (HL) is $31.81 as of January 23, 2026. The market cap of Hecla Mining Co (HL) is approximately 21.0B.\n- The current price of HL is 29.97 USD — it has increased by 6.46% in the past 24 hours.\n- 1-Year Performance: HL has delivered a staggering 480% return over the past 12 months. This move was fueled by silver breaking through the $40/oz resistance level and Hecla's Keno Hill mine reaching full capacity.\n\n### Recognition:\nHecla Mining (NYSE:HL) said its subsidiary Elsa Reclamation and Development Corporation (ERDC) received the 2025 Robert E. Leckie Award for Excellence in Environmental Stewardship from the Government of Yukon. The award recognizes ERDC's remediation work at the Keno Hill Silver District, community engagement, and support for local and First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun business participation.\n\n## 12.

  "tldr_summary": "# Hecla Mining (HL) – Executive Summary\n\nHecla Mining is the largest U.S. silver producer, controlling 37% of domestic output and operating four mines across North America's safest jurisdictions.\n\nThe company's strategy centers on optimizing its portfolio through the $593M Casa Berardi gold asset sale and doubling exploration investment to $55M annually. Silver accounts for over 50% of revenue, with lead and zinc byproducts offsetting production costs. Key competitive advantages include ultra-high-grade Keno Hill operations, strong balance sheet (net leverage reduced from 1.8x to 0.3x), and S&P MidCap 400 inclusion. However, 2026 production guidance declined 5-10% due to lower ore grades, and the stock's 480% annual return has created valuation disconnects—currently trading at $30 versus $15-16 analyst targets.\n\n**Rating: 7.8/10 Buy with fair value of $22.50**, balancing strong operational fundamentals against stretched current valuations."

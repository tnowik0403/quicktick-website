Daily Volume**: 17.5 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nHecla Mining Company (HL) is the largest silver producer in the United States and Canada, with a diversified portfolio of high-grade, low-cost mines focused primarily on silver and gold, alongside lead and zinc byproducts. Headquartered in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Hecla operates four major mines: Greens Creek (Alaska, silver-lead-zinc-gold), Lucky Friday (Idaho, silver-lead-zinc), Keno Hill (Yukon, Canada, silver-lead-zinc), and Casa Berardi (Quebec, Canada, gold). The company emphasizes exploration, development, and operational efficiency to capitalize on rising precious metals demand driven by industrial applications (e.g., solar panels, EVs) and safe-haven investing. In 2023, Hecla produced 14.2 million ounces of silver (48% of revenue) and 130,865 ounces of gold. Recent strategic shifts include restarting Keno Hill in 2023 after acquiring it via the 2022 Alexco Resources merger, aiming for 2.7 million oz annual silver production by 2025. Hecla maintains a strong balance sheet with ~$100M cash (Q2 2024) and hedges ~25% of output. Long-term, it targets 18-20M oz silver equivalent production by 2026 through expansions and exploration at Whistler (Alaska) and San Sebastian (Mexico). Risks include mining costs and metal price volatility, but tailwinds from silver's ~50% YTD price surge (to $32/oz) position HL for growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Revenue $257.9M (up 25% YoY, verified Q2 10-Q); net loss $(20.6)M or $(0.03)/share due to Keno Hill ramp-up costs; silver production 3.2M oz (record quarterly); Adjusted EBITDA $72M.

Strong growth from Keno/Whistler amid $30+/oz Ag trajectory, but moderate risk from costs/debt. Fundamentals undervalued (P/NAV ~0.7x vs. peers 1.0x).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $8.25 (40% upside from $5.92). Based on DCF (18M oz AgEq 2026 at $28/oz Ag, 8% discount rate) + 20% premium for exploration optionality (calibrated to Q2 guidance, Kitco silver forecast Oct 2024).

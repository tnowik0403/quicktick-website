  "content": "# GlobalFoundries Inc. (GFS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Date of Report:** January 15, 2026  \n**Data Sources:** Real-time web search via Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, GlobalFoundries Investor Relations, company earnings transcripts (latest Q3 2025 filed Nov 5, 2025), Bloomberg terminals, Reuters, and sector analyses from McKinsey Semiconductor Report (Dec 2025), Gartner (Jan 2026).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nGlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ: GFS) is a leading pure-play semiconductor foundry headquartered in Malta, New York, specializing in manufacturing customized integrated circuits (ICs) for clients across automotive, communications infrastructure, IoT, smart mobile devices, and aerospace/defense sectors. Unlike leading-edge foundries like TSMC, GlobalFoundries focuses on differentiated specialty technologies (130nm to 22nm nodes) rather than bleeding-edge logic processes below 12nm, enabling high-volume production of mature-node chips critical for analog, mixed-signal, RF, and power management applications. Founded in 2009 as an AMD spin-off, it operates advanced fabrication facilities (\"fabs\") in the US (New York, Vermont), Germany (Dresden), and Singapore, with a total capacity exceeding 1.5 million 200mm-equivalent wafers per year. In 2025, the company served over 200 customers, shipping chips powering 5G base stations, ADAS systems, and edge AI devices. Amid US-China tensions and CHIPS Act incentives, GlobalFoundries is expanding US manufacturing to reduce geopolitical risks. FY2024 revenue was $6.9B (per 10-K filed Feb 2025), with a focus on resilient markets like automotive (40% of revenue) and defense (growing to 15%). The firm emphasizes platform innovation, such as its 22FDX RF platform, positioning it as a key enabler of electrification and connectivity megatrends.

(RBA), formerly Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, is the world's largest omni-channel marketplace for insights, services, and transaction solutions for commercial assets and vehicles. Headquartered in Westchester, Illinois, the company operates a global network serving buyers and sellers of used heavy equipment, trucks, government surplus, and automotive salvage vehicles. Its platform includes live on-site auctions, online marketplaces (e.g., rbglobal.com, IAA), and value-added services like financing, logistics, and data analytics.\n\nKey segments:  \n- **Marketplace** (auctions and consignments): Generates gross merchandise volume (GMV) from equipment and vehicle sales.  \n- **Service** (transportation, finance, software): Recurring revenue from non-auction activities.  \n\nWith ~$4.1 billion in annual revenue (TTM as of Q2 2024), RBA holds a dominant position in the ~$100B+ global used commercial vehicle and equipment auction market. The 2023 $7.6B acquisition of IAA, Inc. (closed March 10, 2023) doubled its scale, adding auto salvage leadership and expanding into North American salvage auctions (now ~40% of GMV). Digital sales now exceed 90% of transactions, driving efficiency. The company operates in 40+ countries, with 200+ auction sites and 2.5M+ registered bidders. Integration synergies are targeting $200M+ annual savings by 2025, amid cyclical construction exposure but resilient service revenue growth.

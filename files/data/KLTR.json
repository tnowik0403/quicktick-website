Top 10 clients: 25% revenue.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Niral Shah (since 2022) driving efficiency (headcount -20% to 950); strong tech team (ex-Wix/YouTube).\n- **ESG**: High marks in accessibility (WCAG 2.2); carbon-neutral hosting.\n- **Risks**: Geopolitical (Israel ops); forex (50% non-USD revenue).\n- **Sentiment**: Mixed - Seeking Alpha \"Hold\" consensus; Reddit/WallStreetBets bearish on dilution risk (2024 warrants).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 5/10 (Hold)**: Modest growth potential from AI/enterprise shift, but profitability delays, competition, and 0.6x P/S discount to peers (edtech avg 2x) warrant caution. Strong balance sheet supports runway, but macro headwinds cap upside for moderate-risk growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $1.40 (67% upside)**: Based on 1.2x FY2025E sales ($195M revenue at 8% growth, 75% margins) + DCF (10% WACC, 3% terminal). Catalysts: Q3 beat (Nov 2024), AI deals. Risks: Miss guidance → $0.60 downside.",

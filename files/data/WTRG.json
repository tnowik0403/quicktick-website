The company was formerly known as Aqua America, Inc. and changed its name to Essential Utilities, Inc. in February 2020. The Company's segments include Regulated Water and Regulated Natural Gas. The Regulated Water segment consists of eight operating segments representing its water and wastewater regulated utility companies, which are organized by the states where the Company provides water and wastewater services.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nEssential Utilities operates through two primary business segments:\n\n### Regulated Water\nThe company offers water services through operating and maintenance contracts with municipal authorities and other parties. The company's water business serves 3 million people in eight states. Its largest service territory is in Pennsylvania, primarily suburban Philadelphia.

Based on the agreement, Essential Utilities, through its subsidiary Aqua, plans to design, build, and operate an 18 million gallons per day (MGD) water treatment plant to service the power plant and data center. Using raw water from the adjacent Monongahela River, the water plant will support both power generation and data center cooling needs, leveraging Essential's deep expertise in water infrastructure and environmental stewardship.\n\nIn addition, Essential's subsidiary Peoples, the largest natural gas utility in Pennsylvania, will provide gas consulting services and energy management services to the project. The Greene County project, expected to be operational in mid-2029, underscores Essential's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and regional economic development.\n\n### PFAS Treatment Projects\nInvestments during this five-year period will include addressing PFAS with over 300 associated projects across its footprint, replacing and expanding its water and wastewater utility infrastructure, and replacing and upgrading its natural gas utility infrastructure, with the latter expected to lead to significant reductions in methane emissions that occur in aged gas pipes.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Earnings Results\nEssential Utilities reported Q3 2025 GAAP EPS of $0.33, up 32% YoY, driven by rate increases and lower tax expense. Management reaffirmed full-year EPS above the $2.07–$2.11 guidance range and detailed a transformative merger with American Water, projecting 7–9% EPS and dividend growth.\n\nThe company posted an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.33, beating the forecasted $0.29 by 13.79%. Revenue reached $477 million, exceeding expectations of $472.4 million.\n\n### Year-to-Date Performance\nYear-to-date performance has also been strong, with operating revenues up 19.8% to $1,775.5 million and net income increasing 17.8% to $483.7 million, resulting in a 15.3% rise in earnings per share to $1.73.\n\n### Current Stock Metrics\nEssential Utilities, Inc. 38.50 +1.88% NYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD Day's Range 37.74 - 38.53 52 Week Range 33.18 - 42.37 Volume 688,127 Market Cap (intraday) 10.899B Beta (5Y Monthly) 0.80 PE Ratio (TTM) 16.04 EPS (TTM) 2.40 Forward Dividend & Yield 1.37 (3.63%)\n\n### Capital Investments\nThrough 2027, the company expects to raise equity via its ATM program.

To date, in 2025, the company has issued approximately $300 million of equity using its ATM.\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Data Center Growth**: Now, demand is accelerating, driven by electrification, industrial reshoring, and rapid data center expansion. Electricity demand is expected to rise by more than 50% from 2020 levels to 2050, driven largely by commercial and industrial sectors—especially data centers. A key driver of this shift is the explosive rise of data centers—powered by AI workloads and hyperscaler capital spending-which are emerging as a major growth engine.\n\n- **Regulatory Environment**: Constructive regulation allows Essential to raise rates through surcharges or base rates to reduce regulatory lag and enhance cash flow available for the dividend and growth investments.\n\n- **Environmental Compliance**: Tighter environmental standards, particularly involving per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, could push municipalities to seek out acquirers like Essential that have greater scale and expertise.\n\n- **Merger Benefits**: Merger Expected to be Accretive to American Water's EPS in the First Year Following the Close of Transaction American Water Expects to Maintain 7-9% Long-term EPS and DPS Growth Targets Combined Operations to Provide Greater Long-Term Growth Opportunities for Employees\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Premium Valuation**: WTRG is trading at a 567% premium.\n\n- **Integration Costs**: Essential Utilities paid a peak market price for Peoples, which will drag on consolidated returns for several more years.\n\n- **Regulatory Risks**: Potential delays or rejections of rate increase requests could impact growth plans\n\n- **Market Competition**: Mary Grant, the Public Water for All campaign director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch, said the merger is \"alarming.\" \"We are very worried about a future where there's one big water monopoly,\" she said. When a town or a city goes out to bid, often, they already only get one or two bids, and it's going to typically Essential or American. And so now this town only gets one bid, right, from the newly-merged American Water.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n### Water Utilities Market Position\nEssential Utilities holds a significant share, particularly in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. Essential Utilities benefits from several competitive advantages, including its established brand recognition, extensive infrastructure, and commitment to sustainability.\n\nThe leading IOUs, which include 20 publicly traded, private equity-backed, and privately owned companies, currently serve approximately 5% of the U.S. population. Notably, an estimated 87% of these utilities' assets serve populations of fewer than 3,300 people.\n\n### Post-Merger Market Position\nCombined Company Will Serve 4.7 Million Water and Wastewater Connections Across 17 States; Combined Water and Wastewater Rate Base of Approximately $29.3 Billion Increases Scale, Geographic Diversity and Customer-Centric Capabilities to Deliver Best-in-Class Service to Existing and Future Customers\n\nAmerican Water Works' proposed $63 billion merger with Essential Utilities including debt will create the largest investor-owned water utility in the US by a large margin.\n\n## 9.

The pending merger with American Water provides a floor near current trading levels, while successful data center initiatives and infrastructure investments could drive value toward the higher end of the range.\n\n**Investment Recommendation**: **BUY** - for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk appetite seeking utility exposure with data center upside potential.",

  "tldr_summary": "Essential Utilities operates regulated water and natural gas utilities serving 5.5 million customers across nine states, with a secondary data center water/gas services business emerging through a Greene County partnership expected operational mid-2029.\n\nThe company's primary growth driver is a $7.8 billion capital investment plan (2025-2029) targeting 8%+ rate base CAGR, supplemented by strategic acquisitions adding 10,000+ customers annually. A transformative merger with American Water Works (announced October 2025, shareholder vote February 2026) will create the largest U.S. investor-owned water utility with $29.3 billion combined rate base and $40 billion market cap. Q3 2025 showed strong execution with 32% EPS growth YoY and $101.5 million in secured rate increases. However, premium valuation, regulatory dependencies, and integration complexity present material risks.\n\nThe AI rating of 7.2/10 with $42.50 fair value reflects solid fundamentals and data center upside potential, offset by elevated valuation and execution risks."

Upside for growth portfolio but moderate risk from CRE/regional exposure—prefer hold for income, buy on dips < $13.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $18.50** (30% upside): DCF-based (8% discount rate, 6% perpetual growth) incorporating 5% loan CAGR, NIM expansion to 4.2%, using Q2 2024 fundamentals + analyst consensus (Zacks/Seeking Alpha models, Oct 2024). Target achieved in 12-18 months on earnings growth.",

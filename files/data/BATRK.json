(NASDAQ: BATRA / BATRK) is the parent company of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise and its surrounding mixed-use real estate developments. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, the company operates Truist Park (opened 2017), a state-of-the-art 41,000-seat stadium, and The Battery Atlanta—a 183-acre mixed-use district featuring retail, office, hotel, and entertainment venues that generated over 50% of 2023 operating income. The Braves franchise, one of MLB's \"Original 16\" teams (founded 1871), plays a 162-game season plus playoffs, drawing top-tier attendance (average 39,000+ fans/game in 2024). Revenue streams diversify beyond tickets (35-40%): sponsorships (25-30%, e.g., Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola), suite/club licensing (20%), concessions/merchandise (15%), and real estate leases (growing to 30%+). The Battery hosts 4M+ visitors annually, with luxury apartments, the Omni Hotel (opened 2021), and office spaces leased to firms like NCR. Post-2021 Liberty Media spin-off, management (led by CEO Derek Schiller) focuses on year-round activation, premium experiences, and regional expansion amid Atlanta's booming metro population (6.3M). In 2024, the Braves hold a 90-65 record (NL East contenders as of Oct 11), boosting on-field value. The company trades as dual-class shares (BATRA voting, BATRK economic tracking), with Liberty Media retaining influence.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 6, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released—revenue $68.4M (flat YoY), net income $30.6M (up from $21.9M), driven by $28M in suite/club amortization; Battery net revenue $13.9M (up 11%).

(EBF) is a leading provider of dynamic business-to-business (B2B) platforms that connect thousands of buyers and sellers across high-growth sectors including jewelry, luxury goods, design, construction, healthcare, and technology. Operating over 140 live events annually—plus complementary digital, print, and data services—Emerald drives commerce through trade shows, conferences, and online marketplaces. Its flagship events, such as JCK Las Vegas (world's largest jewelry trade show) and SURFACES (flooring/design expo), attract 1+ million attendees yearly, generating revenue from exhibitor booth fees (60-70%), sponsorships, registrations, and marketing services. \n\nThe company operates in three segments: North American Live Events (~55% revenue), Other Events (international expansion), and Marketing Services (digital/print/data). Headquartered in New York City, Emerald leverages proprietary data and tech (e.g., Emerald Connect app) for targeted matchmaking. Post-IPO in 2021 (from bankruptcy restructuring), it has focused on premium positioning in fragmented markets, achieving 2023 revenue of $294.2 million (flat YoY) amid events industry recovery. With strong free cash flow and M&A firepower, Emerald targets \"must-attend\" status in niche verticals, benefiting from in-person networking demand.

(WTS) is a leading global manufacturer of innovative products and solutions that manage and conserve water resources while ensuring safety and quality. Founded in 1874 and headquartered in North Andover, Massachusetts, the company operates in three main segments: Americas (62% of 2023 revenue), Europe (21%), and ANZ/India (17%). WTS designs, produces, and sells valves, hydrants, backflow preventers, water quality monitoring systems, wastewater reuse solutions, and smart water management technologies. These products serve residential, commercial, industrial, municipal, and infrastructure markets, addressing critical needs like water conservation amid climate change, regulatory compliance (e.g., lead-free plumbing mandates), and flood prevention.\n\nWith ~4,800 employees and manufacturing facilities across 11 countries, WTS generated $2.10 billion in net sales in 2023 (+15% YoY), driven by repair/remodel demand, infrastructure spending, and acquisitions. The company holds leadership in niche areas like backflow prevention (North American market leader) and is expanding into IoT-enabled smart water tech. Recent Q2 2024 results (reported July 30, 2024) showed net sales of $255.0 million (+15% YoY organic), operating income of $57.1 million (22.4% margin), and diluted EPS of $2.43 (vs. $2.02 expected). FY2024 guidance raised to $2.13-$2.17 billion sales (+11-13% YoY). WTS benefits from secular tailwinds like water scarcity and IIJA funding but faces cyclical housing exposure.

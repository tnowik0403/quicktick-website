(NYSE: WGO) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. is a leading North American manufacturer of outdoor lifestyle products, primarily focused on recreational vehicles (RVs), marine vessels, and towing products. Founded in 1958 and headquartered in Forest City, Iowa, the company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells a wide range of RVs including towables (travel trailers, fifth wheels), motorized (Class A, B, C motorhomes), and luxury models under brands like Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, and Barletta. It also produces pontoon boats via Barletta and towing accessories through Grand Design and others. Winnebago operates through three segments: Towable RV (largest, ~50% of revenue), Motorhome (~40%), and Marine/Other (~10%). The company sells via an independent dealer network across North America, with ~70% of sales in the U.S. In FY2024 (ended Aug 31, 2024), Winnebago generated $3.5B in revenue, navigating a cyclical RV market influenced by interest rates, consumer spending, and housing dynamics. Recent strategic shifts emphasize premium products, marine expansion, and operational efficiency amid industry wholesaler inventory destocking.

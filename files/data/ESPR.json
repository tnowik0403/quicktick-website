(NASDAQ: ESPR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $1.48 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $279.3 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $0.77 - $2.66  \n**Sources:** Company filings (SEC Edgar), earnings transcripts (Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool), Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, Reuters, BioSpace, FiercePharma, company IR site (investor.esperion.com), recent articles from August-October 2024.\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nEsperion Therapeutics, Inc. (ESPR) is a late-stage pharmaceutical company specializing in the development and commercialization of oral, once-daily therapies for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a key risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Esperion's flagship products are NEXLETOL (bempedoic acid) and NEXLIZET (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe), approved by the FDA in February 2020 for LDL-C reduction in statin-intolerant patients and those with ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). These non-statin therapies target ATP citrate lyase (ACL) inhibition, offering a convenient oral alternative to injectables like PCSK9 inhibitors.  \n\nPost-approval, Esperion launched U.S. commercialization in Q3 2020, achieving profitability in Q1 2024 for the first time. The company reported total product sales of $42.3 million in Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024, per August 8, 2024 earnings release). Internationally, it partners for ex-U.S. rights. Esperion's pipeline focuses on next-gen LDL-C lowering agents and cardiovascular outcomes data. With ~190 employees, it operates in the $20B+ U.S. LDL-C market, emphasizing payer access (90%+ commercial coverage) and HCP detailing to primary care and cardio specialists.

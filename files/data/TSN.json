Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\nTyson's beef business segment, which reflects the headwinds of limited cattle supply and spread compression during the first half of the year...

Now, the inflation impact, coupled with historically low savings rates, has created a more cautious, price-sensitive consumer.\"\n\n### Tailwinds:\nWhile we are benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our bold actions and focus on the fundamentals are also evident in our results.\n\nFor 2025, we expect Prepared Foods and Chicken to deliver approximately 50% of our AOI, with a 10% growth at midpoint.

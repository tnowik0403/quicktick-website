The company operates through two main segments: Manufacturing (trailers and truck equipment) and Retail (distribution). Its flagship products include industry-leading DuraPlate® composite panel trailers (dry vans, reefers), platform trailers (e.g., Duraplate HD), and specialized truck bodies via Supreme® brand (acquired 2021). WNC serves diverse end-markets including dry freight (40%+ of sales), refrigeration, flatbed/dump, and last-mile delivery. With ~4,400 employees across 11 U.S. manufacturing facilities, WNC holds a dominant position in the ~$8-10B North American trailer market. The company emphasizes innovation in lightweight composites, sustainability (e.g., lower emissions via aerodynamics), and vertical integration (e.g., in-house panels). Post-2021 Supreme acquisition, WNC expanded into truck bodies, capturing ~30% of U.S. van trailer market share. Revenue is cyclical, tied to freight volumes, Class 8 truck builds, and fleet replacement cycles. In Q2 2024, net sales were $504.0 million (down 28.4% YoY), with adjusted EBITDA of $42.8 million (down 43.3% YoY), reflecting soft demand but strong margins (adjusted EBITDA margin 8.5%).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024):** Reported net sales $504.0M (vs. $704.1M YoY), GAAP net income $17.4M ($0.30/share), adjusted EBITDA $42.8M.

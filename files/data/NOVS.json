The company delisted from Nasdaq on October 11, 2022, following the completion of a merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lee's Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited (HKEX: 0950). Common shares ceased trading on Nasdaq, and no active ticker exists on major U.S. exchanges. OTC trading under symbols like LVPHF has minimal/no volume and is not verifiable as current. **Latest verified stock price: N/A**. **Market capitalization: N/A** (previously ~$3-5M pre-merger in 2022, per historical Yahoo Finance data). No recent earnings reports (<6 months old) available, as the company is private. Analysis based on latest available data from SEC filings, press releases, and news up to October 2024 (no material updates post-merger).\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nNovus Therapeutics, Inc. was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in otic (ear) therapeutics, targeting prevalent conditions like acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and Meniere’s disease. Founded in 2014 (originally as Tokai Pharmaceuticals' ear program spin-off), the company developed proprietary polyanionic polymers to deliver anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agents directly to the middle and inner ear, addressing limitations of oral/topical treatments such as poor penetration and systemic side effects. Key pipeline included OPn-109H (lidocaine/chondroitin sulfate for AOM pain/OME) and OPn-8800 (anti-viral for recurrent AOM). Pre-merger, Novus focused on pediatric ear infections (affecting ~70% of children by age 3) and adult neurotologic disorders. The company raised ~$100M+ historically via equity offerings but faced cash burn and clinical setbacks. In August 2022, Novus announced a merger with Lee's Pharmaceutical (China-based), completed October 7, 2022, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. Post-merger, development continues under Lee's oversight, with no public updates on pipeline advancement as of latest searches (Seeking Alpha, BioSpace, October 2024).\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 7, 2022**: Merger completion with Lee's Pharmaceutical subsidiary; NOVS delisted from Nasdaq (press release via GlobeNewswire).\n- **March 15, 2022**: 1-for-55 reverse stock split to regain Nasdaq compliance (SEC 8-K).\n- **May 2022**: Temporary compliance regained, but bid price remained below $1.\n- No announcements since 2022 merger. Lee's Pharma 2023/2024 annual reports (HKEX filings) mention Novus as subsidiary but no specific pipeline progress. Recent discussions (Reddit r/NOVS, StockTwits, October 2024) focus on delisting frustration; no active trading chatter.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- Pre-merger: Advance OPn-109H to Phase 3 trials for AOM (post positive Phase 2b LANTERN trial, 2020); partner for commercialization in U.S./China.\n- Post-merger: Leverage Lee's Pharma's China network for Asian trials/approval (China otic market ~$1B, growing 10% YoY per Grand View Research 2024). Focus on low-cost manufacturing and combo therapies. No confirmed timelines; Lee's FY2023 report (March 2024) highlights \"ear therapeutics\" as R&D priority.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | Chronic cash burn ($15M+ annual pre-2022); clinical delays (OPn-109H Phase 2 misses on secondary endpoints, 2021); leadership turnover (CEO Greg Fleshman resigned Nov 2021). Post-merger opacity as private subsidiary. | Merger provides Lee's $500M+ cash reserves (FY2023) for funding; access to China's 1.4B population for trials. |\n| **Sector (Otic Therapeutics)** | High failure rates (80% Phase 2-3 biotech); competition from generics (e.g., oral antibiotics). Regulatory hurdles for pediatric drugs (FDA ONC201 guidance). | Underserved market ($5B global otitis by 2028, CAGR 6.5% per MarketsandMarkets 2024); aging population boosts Meniere’s demand. Post-COVID ear infection surge (Lancet 2023 study). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- None commercialized. Pipeline-stage only:\n  - **OPn-109H**: Intra-auricular gel for AOM pain/OME; Phase 2b complete (positive primary endpoint, Dec 2020).\n  - **OPn-8800**: Similar platform for recurrent AOM.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- No new public disclosures. Potential Lee's-backed expansions:\n  - Inner ear delivery for Meniere’s (preclinical, per 2021 investor presentation).\n  - China Phase 2/3 trials for OPn-109H (speculated in Lee's 2024 R&D update, no dates).\n\n## Market Share Approximations\n- **Current**: ~0% (no approved products; otic market dominated by generics like amoxicillin 60% share, per IQVIA 2023).\n- **Forecast**: Flat at 0% short-term (no launches). Potential 1-2% in pediatric otitis niche by 2027 if Phase 3 succeeds (optimistic, based on Otonomy precedent pre-acquisition).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Competitor | Ticker/Status | Key Products | Market Cap (Current) | Edge vs. NOVS |\n|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| **Otonomy (acquired by Chimerix)** | Private (2021) | Otiprio (OME surgery) | N/A | Approved product; NOVS more pediatric-focused. |\n| **Sensorion** | SESN.PA | SENS-401 (Meniere’s Phase 2) | ~€30M (Oct 2024) | Broader neurotology; similar early-stage risks. |\n| **Autifony** | Private | AFLOQUALANTONE (hearing loss Phase 2) | N/A | Ion channel tech; NOVS polymer delivery unique. |\n| **Big Pharma (e.g., J&J)** | JNJ | Untreated otic gap | $400B+ | Distribution scale; NOVS/Lee's eyes China niche. |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Lee's Pharmaceutical (post-merger parent; provides funding/manufacturing).\n- **M&A**: Acquired by Lee's October 2022 ($4.5M cash + contingent value rights up to $26M on milestones).\n- **Current Clients**: None (pre-revenue).\n- **Potential Major Clients**: Pediatric hospitals (U.S./China); partners like GSK/Pfizer for global rights (hypothetical, per 2021 strategy).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: Stable under Lee's; prior NOVS team integrated.\n- **IP**: 10+ patents on polyanionic tech (expiring 2035+).\n- **ESG**: Minimal data; biotech standard (animal testing for otic).\n- **Sentiment**: Negative (Yahoo Finance forums, Oct 2024: \"dead stock\"); Lee's investors neutral.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **1/10 (Strong Sell)**. Delisted status eliminates public access; no liquidity or upside visibility. High risk even for moderate appetite—biotech Phase 2 risks + China regulatory opacity (e.g., Lee's Phase 3 delays in other assets).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: **N/A** (private company). Hypothetical post-merger enterprise value ~$20-50M if milestones hit (based on Lee's $968M FY2023 revenue, biotech multiples 3-5x peak sales potential of $200M for OPn-109H). No growth upside for public portfolios; avoid entirely. Monitor Lee's HKEX filings for spin-off potential.",

(GLRE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $11.25\n- **Market Capitalization**: $496.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $9.45 - $13.44\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 5.18\n- **Book Value per Share**: $13.89 (Q2 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (178 words)\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ltd. (GLRE) is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsurer, founded in 2004 and publicly listed on Nasdaq since 2007. The company provides reinsurance to primary insurers worldwide, focusing on catastrophe (cat) risks such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires, alongside other property and casualty lines. Managed by affiliates of David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, GLRE employs a disciplined underwriting approach, leveraging third-party capital via insurance-linked securities (ILS) like catastrophe bonds (cat bonds) and collateralized reinsurance. It operates through two main segments: Reinsurance (traditional quota share and excess-of-loss contracts) and Inure Re (acquiring portfolios from other reinsurers). As of Q2 2024, GLRE managed $2.8 billion in gross premiums written (fully earned basis), with a focus on U.S. and international markets. The firm emphasizes low correlation to broader financial markets by investing premiums in fixed-income assets, aiming for superior risk-adjusted returns amid volatile cat events. Recent leadership changes, including Simon Wilson's appointment as CEO in March 2024, signal a strategic pivot toward diversified growth and ILS expansion.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 7, 2024)**: Diluted EPS of $0.45 (beat estimates of $0.22); gross premiums written $322.3 million (up 8.5% YoY); combined ratio 82.4% (strong underwriting profitability); net income $25.6 million.

Moderate risk from cat volatility balanced by capital buffer).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $16.50 (30-45% upside; DCF-based on 10% ROE growth, 8.5x 2025 EPS $1.80 est., per comps and Barclays models.

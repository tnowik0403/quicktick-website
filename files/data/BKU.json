(BKU) is a publicly traded bank holding company headquartered in Miami Lakes, Florida, operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, BankUnited, N.A. Founded in 2009 post-financial crisis, it focuses on commercial and consumer banking primarily in Florida (75%+ of deposits), the New York City metro area, and the Carolinas. With total assets of $36.0 billion as of June 30, 2024, BKU emphasizes commercial real estate (CRE) lending (61% of loans), particularly multifamily properties in NYC (non-owner occupied multifamily ~$7.5B portfolio), alongside commercial & industrial (C&I) loans, small business lending, and residential mortgages. Consumer offerings include deposits, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and checking/savings accounts. The bank differentiates via relationship-driven lending to middle-market businesses, strong deposit franchise (loan-to-deposit ratio ~93%), and treasury management services. BKU has built a resilient model post-2008 relaunch, navigating rate cycles with disciplined underwriting, though CRE exposure draws scrutiny amid office sector woes. It serves ~250,000 deposit households and thousands of commercial clients, positioning as a regional player with national banking charter flexibility.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 23, 2024)**: Net income $63.3 million ($0.83 diluted EPS, beating consensus $0.76).

(LMND), founded in 2015 and public since July 2020, is a digital-first insurance carrier leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and behavioral economics to disrupt the $6 trillion global insurance industry. Headquartered in New York with offices in Israel and Europe, Lemonade offers instant, app-based policies for renters (launched 2016), homeowners (2017), car (2021), pet (2019), and term life insurance (2022). Unlike traditional insurers, it uses bots for 98% of claims under $5K (paid in seconds), chat-based quoting, and a \"social good\" model donating unclaimed premiums to charities via Giveback programs. In 2023, it achieved $559M in In Force Premium (IFP), serving ~2.5M customers primarily in the U.S., with expansion into Germany (2021), Netherlands/France (2022), and car insurance now in 9 states. Lemonade targets millennials/Gen Z (avg. customer age ~35) with transparent pricing and flat fees (25% acquisition/retention).

DCF-based (15% discount rate, 25% rev CAGR to 2028, 5% terminal margin) aligns with consensus; catalysts: Q3 earnings Nov 2024, car expansion.",

The company operates through two main segments: North America Steel (accounting for ~95% of revenues) and Europe Steel. In North America, CMC is one of the largest U.S. producers of rebar (steel reinforcement bar), with four mini-mills (electric arc furnace-based) producing ~2.5 million tons annually of rebar, merchant bar, and wire rod from recycled scrap metal. It also leads in rebar fabrication, processing ~1.5 million tons yearly into custom assemblies for concrete reinforcement, alongside construction services like precast and paving. The Europe Steel segment operates two mills in Poland and one in Romania, producing ~1 million tons of rebar and merchant products for regional markets. CMC's vertically integrated model—from scrap recycling (14 metals recycling plants processing 5+ million tons/year) to fabrication—emphasizes sustainability, low-carbon steel production via EAF technology (95%+ recycled content), and efficiency. With ~14,000 employees, CMC benefits from U.S. infrastructure spending (e.g., IIJA) and exports ~10% of output. Trailing 12-month revenue stands at ~$8.8B (FY2024), with a focus on high-margin fabrication (30%+ of sales) amid cyclical steel pricing.

Overall steel volumes +5% CAGR through 2027 (management guidance, Sept 2024 call).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (FY2024 Est.) | CMC | Nucor (NUE) | Steel Dynamics (STLD) | Gerdau (GGB) |\n|----------------------|-----|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| **Rev ($B)** | 8.8 | 31.4 | 17.9 | 15.2 |\n| **EBITDA Margin** | 12% | 14% | 18% | 10% |\n| **Rebar Capacity (M tons)** | 3.5 | 6+ | 4 | 5 (global) |\n| **P/E** | 11.2 | 13.5 | 12.8 | 8.5 |\n| **Key Edge** | Fab leadership, recycling | Scale/diversification | High margins, mini-mills | Low-cost Brazil ops |\n\nCMC trades at discount to peers on EV/EBITDA (6.5x vs. 7.5x avg.), undervalued on fab growth.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Strategic with BlueScope Steel (Australia) for tech sharing; SCI for carbon benchmarking.\n- **Recent M&A**: Arizon recycler (July 2023, $200M); 3 fab shops (Q3/Q4 FY2024, undisclosed <$50M each).\n- **Major Clients**: Turner Construction, Kiewit (infrastructure); Bechtel (energy); data center devs (e.g., via Microsoft hyperscalers). Potential: EV battery plants (e.g., Tesla suppliers), offshore wind projects.\n- **Pipeline**: Targeting West Coast recycling M&A; hyperscaler data center contracts (10%+ backlog growth).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-quartile sustainability (CDP A- score); 95% recycled input reduces emissions 70% vs. blast furnaces.\n- **Management**: CEO Moe Lyons (since 2021) driving 20% TSR since; insider ownership 1.5%.\n- **Risks**: 60% revenue tied to construction cycles; FX exposure in Europe (5% sales).\n- **Opportunities**: $1.2T infrastructure spend through 2026; reshoring manufacturing.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Attractive valuation (11x forward P/E vs. 14x sector), 10-15% upside from infra tailwinds, fab margin expansion to 20%+, capacity growth. Hold/sell below 7 for conservative; buy aggressively for growth.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $68/share (18% upside from $57.41) – DCF-based (10% WACC, 5% terminal growth), implying 13x FY2026 EPS $5.20.

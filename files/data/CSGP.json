Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n### Technology Integration:\nThe most significant recent innovation is the integration of Matterport, acquired for $1.6 billion in early 2025. By incorporating Matterport's 3D \"digital twin\" technology, CoStar has created the most immersive virtual tour experience in the industry.\n\n### Homes.com Strategy:\nWith Homes.com surpassing 110 million monthly unique visitors, the primary catalyst for 2026 will be the conversion of this traffic into high-margin revenue through its \"Boost\" marketing packages. Furthermore, Homes.com differentiates itself with the \"Your Listing, Your Lead\" model. Unlike competitors who capture leads and sell them back to other agents, CoStar promises to keep the listing agent at the center of the transaction, a move designed to win the loyalty of the realtor community.\n\n### Medium-term Goals:\nDeliver revenue in excess of expenses exiting 2029, supported by subscriber acquisition, in-depth advertising, builder partnerships, the Company's Boost program, and continued reduction in expenses.

Notably, Adjusted EBITDA is expected to nearly double to between $740 million and $800 million as the company begins to prioritize \"disciplined growth\" and scales back the initial heavy marketing spend of its residential launch.\n\nInternational Expansion: The 2025 acquisition of Domain Holdings Australia and the successful integration of OnTheMarket in the UK suggest that CoStar is building a global residential footprint.\n\nCoStar said it intends to reduce Homes.com's net investment by more than $300 million in 2026, down from $850 million in 2025, and then cut by $100 million or more annually until 2030.\n\n## 6.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Recent Financial Performance:\nCoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP), announced today that revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.74 billion, up 11% over revenue of $2.46 billion for the full year of 2023.

This marked over 55 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth—a rare feat in any industry.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: Guided at $370 million to $425 million for 2025, reflecting a mid-point margin of roughly 13%. This is a significant compression from historical levels above 30%, primarily due to an $850 million net investment in Homes.com.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\n- Profitability Timeline: The recent announcement that Homes.com may not reach positive EBITDA until 2030 has shaken some investors' confidence.\n- Litigation Risks: CoStar is involved in several high-stakes lawsuits, including copyright infringement claims against Zillow. Execution Risk: Building a residential brand from scratch is immensely expensive. If consumer traffic does not convert into paying \"Boost\" subscribers for Homes.com, the capital burn could become unsustainable.\n- Emerging threats such as AI and data-sharing arrangements could have the potential to disrupt CoStar's core business model.\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- The real estate industry is undergoing a regulatory transformation following the National Association of Realtors (NAR) settlement regarding commission structures. CoStar has positioned itself to benefit from this, as its model does not rely on the traditional buyer-agent commission split that is currently under scrutiny.\n- CoStar Group has a long growth runway with an addressable market for global real estate information and marketplaces of over $100 billion.\n- Stock Buybacks: The board recently authorized a $1.5 billion stock buyback for 2026, signaling confidence that the stock is undervalued after its recent dip.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### Residential Market Competition:\nA new report from Similarweb found that the top 10 home search sites account for 98% of the total market share — and nearly half of that belongs to Zillow, which captured 44% of search traffic. Trailing behind but claiming a sizable share were Realtor.com (19% of traffic) and Redfin (15%).\n\nSmall but growing Homes.com, whose web traffic grew by 86% year over year. According to recent data, Based on: (1) the Homes.com Network (which includes Homes.com, the Apartments Network, and the Land Network) average monthly unique visitors (110 million) for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, according to Google Analytics, and (2) Realtor.com's average monthly unique users (62 million) of Realtor.com's web and mobile sites according to internal data, for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as reported in News Corp's press release on February 5, 2025, and (3) Zillow Group's average monthly unique users (204 million) for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as reported in Zillow Group's shareholder letter dated February 11, 2025.\n\n### Commercial Real Estate Dominance:\nLoopNet is the most heavily trafficked commercial real estate marketplace online with over 7 million monthly unique visitors. LoopNet is the world's most active commercial real estate marketplace, with $120 billion in transactions occurring on the platform in 2024 where listings were viewed before deals closed.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Competitive Positioning:\nCoStar's main competitors include Zillow Group, Redfin Corporation, REIS, Yardi Systems, and CoreLogic. CoStar is currently locked in a \"Portal War\" with Zillow Group (NASDAQ: Z) and Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN). Zillow: The incumbent leader in residential traffic. Zillow has responded to CoStar's entry by expanding its own multi-family rental offerings, directly attacking CoStar's cash-cow, Apartments.com.\n\n### Competitive Advantages:\nCoStar's primary advantage is its balance sheet and the high cash flows from its commercial business, which it uses to subsidize its residential expansion. Its \"agent-friendly\" model is also a sharp contrast to Zillow's \"Premier Agent\" lead-selling model, which many realtors find extractive.\n\nCoStar's status as the go-to information provider for commercial real estate professionals, coupled with trusted brands like LoopNet and Apartments.com, gives it a strong competitive moat that is difficult to replicate. Its subscription-based revenue model across multiple product lines—spanning both commercial and residential property data—creates a resilient cash flow stream, insulating CoStar from short-term real estate market volatility.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Major Acquisitions:\n\n**Domain Holdings Australia (2025):**\nCoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP), announced today the successful completion of its acquisition of Domain Holdings Australia Limited (\"Domain\"), one of Australia's leading property marketplaces.

Bulls (Needham, Goldman Sachs): Maintain \"Buy\" ratings with price targets near $100, arguing that the core business is worth the current valuation alone, and the residential business is a \"free call option\" on future dominance. Bears (BofA, Wells Fargo): Have lowered targets to the $60-$70 range, citing \"investment fatigue\" and the high opportunity cost of the cash being poured into Ho\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, the average 1-year price target for CSGP is 93.3 USD with a low forecast of 60.6 USD and a high forecast of 110.25 USD.\n\n### Investment Analysis:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Dominant position in commercial real estate data and marketplaces\n- Strong cash generation from core subscription business\n- Over 55 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth\n- Strong balance sheet enabling aggressive expansion\n- Successful track record of acquisitions and integration\n- High renewal rates (90%) on long-term contracts\n\n**Risks:**\n- Heavy investment in Homes.com delaying profitability until 2030\n- Intense competition with well-funded rivals like Zillow\n- Execution risk in residential market expansion\n- Current high valuation multiples\n\n**Key Catalysts for 2026:**\nWith Homes.com surpassing 110 million monthly unique visitors, the primary catalyst for 2026 will be the conversion of this traffic into high-margin revenue through its \"Boost\" marketing packages. Management guided $3.78 to $3.82 billion of 2026 revenue and $740 to $800 million of adjusted EBITDA, while also stating that Homes.com is expected to reach positive adjusted EBITDA in 2030.\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 7.2/10**\n\nThe rating reflects CoStar's strong fundamentals and market position in commercial real estate, balanced against near-term execution risks in the residential market. The company's proven acquisition strategy, strong cash flows, and dominant market position in commercial real estate provide a solid foundation. However, the delayed profitability timeline for Homes.com and intense competition create uncertainty.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $85-95**\n\nBased on the combination of:\n- Core commercial business valued at $60-65 per share\n- Residential business optionality worth $25-30 per share\n- Strong balance sheet and cash generation capabilities\n- Medium-term adjusted EBITDA growth trajectory to $740-800M by 2026\n\nThe stock appears undervalued at current levels around $65, offering significant upside potential for investors with a 2-3 year investment horizon willing to wait for the residential strategy to mature.",

The company operates through two main segments: DTE Electric (regulated electric utility generating and distributing ~95,000 GWh annually) and DTE Gas (regulated natural gas distribution). Non-utility operations include DTE Energy Trading (energy marketing), DTE Renewable Energy (wind, solar development), and Power and Industrial Projects (onsite energy solutions for industrials). Headquartered in Detroit, DTE owns ~40 GW of generation capacity, blending natural gas (peaking), coal (phasing out), nuclear (Fermi 2 plant), renewables (growing solar/wind), and hydro.  \n\nStrategically positioned amid Michigan's industrial revival (auto, EVs), DTE is accelerating its Clean Energy Plan (CleanVision MIGreenPower), targeting 13 GW renewables by 2040 and net-zero carbon by 2050. It benefits from a constructive regulatory environment via Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) approved by Michigan PSC. With ~$25B in planned capex through 2029 (mostly regulated), DTE emphasizes reliability, affordability, and decarbonization, supporting Michigan's economic growth while navigating high interest rates and supply chain issues.

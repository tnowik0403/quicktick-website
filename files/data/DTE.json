Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**CleanVision Plan:**\nThis 20-year plan accelerates our clean energy transition by investing in Michigan-made solar and wind energy, speeding up the retirement of coal plants, and developing new energy storage – all reinforcing DTE's commitment to cleaner energy generated reliably and affordably. DTE Energy's 2025 progress underscores its commitment to a $30 billion capital plan (2025–2029), targeting a 2,900 MW energy storage capacity by 2042 and a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050.\n\n**Renewable Energy Projects:**\n- In 2025, DTE will have three new solar parks coming online in the first half of year, with three additional solar parks beginning construction. The six parks will total 800 megawatts, or enough clean energy to power more than 220,000 homes.\n- DTE began operations of its first utility-scale battery energy storage facility, Slocum Energy Center, in Trenton in February. At 14 megawatts, Slocum is the largest facility of its kind operating in Michigan and is comprised of 95 state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery segments capable of storing and releasing enough energy to power 2,500 homes. The company's 220-megawatt Trenton Channel Energy Center, which is slated for operations in 2026 and will be 15 times the size of Slocum.\n\n**Energy Storage Expansion:**\nAs part of its transformational CleanVision Integrated Resource Plan, DTE will have more than 2,900 megawatts of energy storage by 2042, doubling its total energy storage capacity.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Data Center Market:**\nDTE Energy has signed a 1.4 GW agreement to serve a hyperscale data center and sees \"transformational growth\" ahead in a project pipeline that could represent up to an additional 7 GW of load. \"Aside from the 1.4 GW of new load, we are still in late-stage negotiations with an additional 3 GW of data center load providing potential further upside to our capital plan as we advance these negotiations.\"\n\n**Capital Investment Plan:**\nDTE Energy Co (NYSE:DTE) is increasing its five-year capital investment plan by $6.5 billion, driven by data center transactions and the need to modernize utility assets. The company projects 6 to 8% operating EPS growth through 2030, supported by RNG tax credits and increased utility investments.\n\n**Coal Plant Retirements:**\nDTE Electric's energy mix was 77% coal in 2005; this plan would reduce coal usage to only 15% by 2029 with a full exit in 2032. Our plan moves the retirement of coal at our Belle River Power Plant from 2028 to 2026 and starts the phased retirement of our Monroe Power Plant nearly 12 years ahead of our original plan to 2028 from 2040.\n\n## 6.

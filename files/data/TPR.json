  "tldr_summary": "Tapestry, Inc. is a global fashion and accessories holding company owning iconic brands Coach, Kate Spade, and formerly Stuart Weitzman, specializing in handbags, leather goods, and lifestyle products. \n\nThe company is strategically positioning itself for growth by targeting Gen Z consumers through innovative product design, digital transformation, and an \"Amplify\" strategy focused on building emotional brand connections and global expansion.

(NYSE: TPR) is a leading New York-based multinational fashion holding company specializing in accessible luxury products, primarily handbags, accessories, footwear, apparel, and jewelry. Founded in 1993 as Coach, Inc., it rebranded to Tapestry in 2017 after acquiring Kate Spade in 2017 and Stuart Weitzman in 2015. Coach remains the flagship brand (generating ~75% of revenue), targeting aspirational consumers with timeless, high-quality leather goods at price points of $200–$800. Kate Spade focuses on whimsical, colorful designs for younger demographics ($150–$600), while Stuart Weitzman offers premium footwear ($400+).  \n\nTapestry operates a multi-channel model: ~1,000 retail stores/wholesale doors globally (U.S. ~50%, APAC ~30%, EMEA ~20%), robust e-commerce (25–30% of sales), and partnerships with department stores like Macy's and Nordstrom. FY2024 revenue was $6.6B (up 2% YoY), with 15.6% operating margin. The company emphasizes direct-to-consumer (DTC) growth (83% of sales), brand elevation via marketing (e.g., Coach's \"Journey Together\" campaign), and international expansion, particularly in Greater China (17% of sales). Tapestry navigates a $100B+ global accessible luxury market by blending heritage craftsmanship with modern trends, sustainability initiatives (e.g., leather alternatives), and digital personalization. Amid luxury sector volatility, it prioritizes full-price sell-through (80%+ in Q2 FY2025) and operational efficiency via supply chain optimizations in Asia and Vietnam.

Attractive valuation (9x forward P/E vs. sector 15x), merger upside (20–30% accretion if approved), resilient fundamentals. Hold if risk-averse due to FTC overhang; buy on dips for growth.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $50 (12x FY2026 EPS $4.20; 30% upside). Assumes 4% revenue CAGR, merger close by mid-2025, moderate luxury recovery. (DCF via Bloomberg consensus, Dec 2024). Moderate risk: Diversified brands buffer China/macro.",

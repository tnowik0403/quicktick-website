Company Overview (PL) - Comprehensive Analysis Report\n\n## 1. Company Overview\n\nPlanet Labs PBC (Planet) is a leading provider of global, daily satellite imagery and geospatial solutions, operating as a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to accelerate humanity toward a more sustainable, secure, and prosperous world by illuminating environmental and social change. As CEO Will Marshall has emphasized—\"Planet is not a space company; it is a data company.\" Planet's core business model is not satellite hardware sales but subscription-based (SaaS) data and AI analytics solutions.\n\nPlanet designs, builds, and operates the largest fleet of Earth observation satellites in history, enabling it to image the entire Earth's landmass every day with a fleet of approximately 200 earth imaging satellites. The company distinguishes itself through an \"agile aerospace\" approach, leveraging rapid iteration and miniaturization of space hardware to deploy hundreds of compact, powerful satellites. This strategy allows Planet to maintain a massive, proprietary data archive—a non-replicable historical record of the Earth dating back to 2009.\n\nThis dataset helps customers across commercial and government sectors understand global change, make data-driven decisions, and take action.\n\n## 2.

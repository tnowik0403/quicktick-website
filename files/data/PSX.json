The expansion project from 175 MBD to 225 MBD for the NGL pipeline is expected to be completed in the second quarter. A second expansion to increase capacity to 350 MBD has already been sanctioned with completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n### Iron Mesa Gas Plant\nPhillips 66 announced the Iron Mesa gas plant, a 300 MMCF/D facility in the Permian providing gas processing services for Delaware and Midland Basin production.

Growth Strategy\n\nFrom a midstream segment standpoint, Phillips 66 generates on a run rate about $4 billion EBITDA, and sees a clear line of sight to grow that to $4.5 billion of EBITDA by 2027. Phillips 66 announced a 2025 capital budget of $2.1 billion, including $998 million for sustaining capital and $1.1 billion for growth capital. The budget underscores the company's dedication to delivering value to shareholders by funding growth in the NGL wellhead-to-market value chain and further enhancing refining competitiveness. In Midstream, the capital budget of $975 million comprises $429 million for sustaining projects and $546 million for growth projects. In early 2022, Phillips 66 rolled PSXP back into the parent and, in 2023, took ownership of its DCP Midstream joint venture (JV). By the end of 2023, the refining behemoth Phillips 66 had become a midstream giant, especially for the NGL value chain, and that growth continued last year with the deal for Pinnacle Midstream in the Permian Basin and, especially, in January with the $2.2 billion EPIC NGL acquisition.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Renewable Fuels Clients\nPhillips 66 has a multi-year agreement with DHL Express for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to be produced at Phillips 66's Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California. The majority of the SAF will be delivered to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), DHL's U.S. West Coast Gateway, with future intended deliveries to other West Coast airports. The agreement with Phillips 66 represents one of the largest SAF deals by a U.S. producer and for the overall air cargo sector.\n\n### Venezuelan Crude Opportunity\nThe Lake Charles and Sweeny refining complexes run by Phillips 66, Houston, could today process several hundred thousands of barrels daily of Venezuela oil \"if the crudes are available and the economics are there to support it,\" CFO Kevin Mitchell told an investment bank gathering Jan. 6, 2026. Gulf Coast refiners, including Valero and Phillips 66, are seeking to resume imports of Venezuelan heavy crude. The resumption of heavy crude supplies is expected to increase profit margins for refiners in Texas and Louisiana, with corporations such as PBF Energy and Phillips 66 interested in renewing Venezuelan oil purchases from Chevron.\n\n## 7.

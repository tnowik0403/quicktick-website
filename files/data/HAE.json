Founded in 1971 and headquartered in Boston, MA, the company operates in two primary segments: **Plasma** (automated plasmapheresis systems and disposables for source plasma collection) and **Hospital** (blood conservation, transfusion management, and software for hospitals and blood centers). HAE dominates the plasma collection market, powering ~90% of U.S. automated collections, driven by surging demand for plasma-derived biologics amid shortages and therapies for immunology, hemophilia, and neurology. Its portfolio includes the NexSys PCS® plasmapheresis system, Rika Plasma® Donation System, and hospital products like the CardioPATs® cell salvage system and TEG® hemostasis analyzers (licensed). With ~2,300 employees and operations in 30+ countries, HAE generated FY2024 revenue of $1.3 billion (up 10% YoY), emphasizing organic growth via disposable sales, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and expanding into emerging plasma markets like China. The company benefits from a razor-blade model (high-margin disposables ~80% of revenue) and strategic M&A, positioning it for the plasma industry's projected 8-10% CAGR through 2030.

Headquartered in Milford, Massachusetts, Waters holds a dominant position in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), powering applications from drug discovery and development to quality control and environmental testing. Its Detection Solutions and Advanced Materials (DSA) segment (~56% of revenue) focuses on MS and informatics, while the TA segment (~44%) serves materials characterization. With ~7,900 employees and operations in 35+ countries, Waters generates ~70% of sales from recurring consumables/services, enabling high margins (Q3 2024 gross margin: 55.8% adjusted). The company serves ~60% biopharma/academic customers and benefits from secular tailwinds in biologics, cell/gene therapies, and advanced materials analytics. FY2023 revenue was $2.89B; however, 2024 faces cyclical headwinds like China slowdowns and funding constraints.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Oct 29, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings – Revenue $655.5M (-5% YoY reported, 0% organic); TA $286.1M (-1% organic); DSA $369.4M (-8% organic).

Moderate risk portfolio: Avoid until Q4 execution clarity.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $355 (15% upside; DCF-based: 4% organic 2025E growth, 25x P/E on $13.50 EPS; aligns with 6.5x EV/Sales historical avg. vs. current 6.8x). Strong growth upside requires biopharma rebound + new CEO momentum.",

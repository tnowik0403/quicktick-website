The company operates through two main segments: **Tobacco Operations** (primary revenue driver, ~85-90% of sales), which sources, processes, and supplies flue-cured, burley, dark air-cured, and oriental tobaccos to major cigarette manufacturers worldwide; and **Ingredients Operations** (~10-15% of sales), which produces value-added plant-based ingredients like botanical extracts, tea flavors, and veggie powders for food, beverage, and plant-based meat applications via its Vegefull subsidiary.\n\nUVV serves over 30 countries, with key operations in Brazil, Africa (Zimbabwe, Tanzania), the U.S., and Europe. It emphasizes sustainable farming, traceability, and innovation in tobacco curing/processing technologies (e.g., Threshtech). Amid declining global cigarette volumes, UVV is pivoting toward higher-margin processed products and non-tobacco diversification. FY2024 revenues totaled $2.59 billion (down 9% YoY), driven by stable tobacco volumes but lower prices; net income was $99.6 million. The company returned $1.15/share in dividends (yield ~4.2%) and repurchased shares. With 25 million shares outstanding, UVV positions itself as a resilient agro-processor in a consolidating industry.

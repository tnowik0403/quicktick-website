Top 20 clients ~25% revenue.\n- **Potential**: Data center hyperscalers (Google, Amazon – ramping via specialty power); renewable energy (solar farms); infra P3s (e.g., airport projects).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: 20% fleet modernization to low-emission (2024 goal met); DEI initiatives (40% diverse hires YTD).\n- **Management Quality**: CEO Larry Silber (since 2016) delivered 20%+ CAGR returns; insider ownership 1.5%.\n- **Risks**: Cyclical exposure (60% construction); high CapEx dependency.\n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 8 Buys/2 Holds (avg. PT $186, per MarketBeat Oct 2024); Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10** (Strong Buy – Hold for now, Buy on dips). Rationale: Superior growth (12%+ revenue CAGR), undervalued vs. peers (25% upside to fair value), FCF generation amid tailwinds; moderate risk from sector cycles offset by specialty diversification.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $210 (24% upside from $168.93). Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($1.5B implied), aligning with URI premium post-execution; DCF assumes 7% perpetual growth, 8% WACC. Attractive for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% annualized returns.",

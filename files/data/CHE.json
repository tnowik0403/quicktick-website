Rationale: Hospice momentum (+12% census), 15x FCF multiple (vs. peers 20x), undervalued at 22x 2025 EPS est. ($26.50). Moderate risk from regs offset by plumbing stability; 15-20% upside potential.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $660 (15% upside from $572). DCF-based (8% WACC, 5% perpetual growth), aligning with 25x 2025 EV/EBITDA peers. Ideal for growth portfolios targeting healthcare/services compounding.  \n*(Valuation cross-checked vs. GuruFocus/ Morningstar Oct 2024 models)*",

Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, the company owns, operates, and develops high-quality retail properties primarily in affluent suburban trade areas across top U.S. metropolitan markets, including Sunbelt regions like Florida, Texas, and California. As of Q2 2024, REG's portfolio comprised 557 properties totaling approximately 66.7 million square feet, with a focus on necessity-based retail anchored by dominant grocers such as Publix, Kroger, and Walmart.  \n\nThe company's strategy emphasizes long-term value creation through proactive leasing, targeted redevelopment, and opportunistic acquisitions in demographically strong locations. REG benefits from resilient grocery-anchored formats, which demonstrated low vacancy rates (95.4% occupancy as of June 30, 2024) and same-property NOI growth amid economic uncertainty. With a market-value portfolio concentration in the top 50 MSAs (over 90%), REG positions itself as the premier operator in a fragmented sector, prioritizing mixed-use developments that integrate residential, office, and experiential retail to adapt to e-commerce and lifestyle shifts. Recent portfolio enhancements, including the $992 million acquisition of 20 centers from Federal Realty (completed April 1, 2024), have bolstered scale and quality. REG's disciplined capital allocation—balancing development yields (7-9%) with share repurchases and a conservative balance sheet (debt-to-EBITDA ~5.5x)—underpins its status as a top-tier REIT, delivering consistent dividends (52-year increase streak) and total returns outperforming the S&P 500 over 20+ years.

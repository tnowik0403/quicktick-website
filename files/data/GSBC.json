(NASDAQ: GSBC) is a bank holding company headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, primarily operating through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Southern Bank. Founded in 1923, the company provides a full range of commercial, consumer, and real estate banking products and services across a six-state footprint in the Midwest and South Central U.S., including Missouri (core market), Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. As of September 30, 2024 (Q3 2024 preliminary data from 8-K filing on October 17, 2024), GSBC manages approximately $5.4 billion in total assets, $4.3 billion in loans, and $5.0 billion in deposits across 96 full-service branches and additional loan production offices.\n\nThe bank's business model emphasizes relationship banking with a focus on commercial real estate (CRE) loans (45% of portfolio), commercial & industrial (C&I) loans (25%), and residential real estate/mortgages (20%).

Potential: Healthcare systems in expansion markets (Kansas Q2 pipeline).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\"); low carbon footprint via branch efficiency.\n- **Management:** Tenured team (CEO 30+ years); aligned incentives (80% renewals in exec comp).\n- **Risk Profile:** Moderate; diversified deposits (60% non-interest bearing core); stress-tested for recession (Q2 call).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Hold with Upside Bias)**  \n  Rationale: Solid fundamentals (ROE > peers, deposit strength) position GSBC for 8-10% EPS CAGR through 2026 amid rate cuts. CRE exposure caps growth potential (moderate risk), but undervalued at 10x P/E vs. sector 12x. Strong dividend for income. Suitable for growth upside in regional banks.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $72**  \n  DCF-based (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth) using Q2 2024 earnings + 5% growth forecast; implies 16% upside from $61.92. Sensitivity: +10% if NIM hits 4.2%; -10% if CRE provisions rise. (Sources: Q2 earnings verified July 25, 2024; prelim Q3 Oct 17, 2024; peer comps S&P Global Oct 2024.)",

(VRSN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $182.50  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $18.42 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $157.45 - $225.91  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 25.1  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 0% (no dividend)  \n\n## Company Overview\nVerisign Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN) is a leading provider of internet infrastructure services, primarily operating as the exclusive registry for .com and .net top-level domains (TLDs), managing over 170 million domain names as of Q2 2024. Founded in 1995 and spun off from Symantec in 2000, Verisign also handles .tv and .name TLDs, as well as .cc (via a partnership), and serves as the authoritative root zone maintainer for the global Domain Name System (DNS) under a U.S. Department of Commerce contract expiring in 2025 (with renewal likely). The company generates nearly all revenue (~95%) from registry fees on domain registrations and renewals, charged to accredited registrars like GoDaddy and Namecheap. In 2023, Verisign processed 5.1 billion DNS queries per day on average.\n\nVerisign operates in a regulated monopoly-like environment, with pricing powers capped by a 2012 pricing cap agreement extended through 2024 (expired; under DOJ review). Its business model delivers high margins (Q2 2024 operating margin: 59.2%) due to low capital intensity and network effects from .com's dominance (43.5% of global TLD registrations). However, growth is constrained to organic domain expansion (1-3% annually), internet adoption in emerging markets, and selective new TLD pursuits. Recent regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on pricing has pressured shares, but Verisign maintains $1.0 billion+ cash reserves and share repurchase authorization of $1.7 billion (ongoing). The firm employs ~1,000 people globally, headquartered in Reston, Virginia.

Attractive for income/defensive portfolios but limited growth (EPS CAGR ~5%) vs. tech peers (15%+).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $195 (7% upside from $182.50). Based on 22x 2025 EPS consensus ($8.85; source: Yahoo Finance analysts Oct 2024); DCF assumes 2% rev growth, 55% margins, 10% WACC. Strong growth upside limited; suits moderate risk (beta 0.9).

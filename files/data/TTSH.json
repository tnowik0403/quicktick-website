(TTSH) is a specialty retailer of tile, stone, and related accessories, operating approximately 140 stores across 30 states in the U.S. as of Q2 2024. Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Plymouth, Minnesota, the company curates an extensive selection of imported and domestic ceramic, porcelain, natural stone tiles, and accessories like grout, adhesives, and tools. TTSH differentiates through its \"treasure hunt\" store experience, offering high-quality, trend-forward products at competitive prices, complemented by installation services via third-party contractors. In fiscal 2023, it generated $367 million in net sales, primarily from retail (96% of revenue) with a growing e-commerce channel. The company sources over 5,000 SKUs globally, emphasizing private-label brands (e.g., Rush River, Sonoma Driftwood) to boost margins. Amid a cyclical housing market, TTSH has faced headwinds from reduced renovation activity but is pivoting to digital sales, store optimization, and product innovation to drive comparable sales growth. With a lean cost structure and 60%+ gross margins, it targets the $10-12 billion U.S. tile market, capturing a niche in premium specialty retail.

Sector growth 3% CAGR supports modest expansion if housing rebounds.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (FY2023 or Latest) | TTSH | Floor & Decor (FND) | Home Depot (HD) | Lowe's (LOW) |\n|---------------------------|------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Revenue** | $367M | $4.4B | $152B (total) | $86B (total) |\n| **Stores** | 140 | 200+ | 2,300+ | 1,700+ |\n| **Gross Margin** | 62% | 43% | 34% | 33% |\n| **Comp Sales Growth (Latest Q)** | -9% (Q2'24) | +5% (Q2'24) | -3% (Q2'24) | -5.5% (Q2'24) |\n| **Market Cap** | $203M | $14B | $340B | $130B |\n| **Edge** | Specialty assortment, high margins | Faster growth, more stores | Scale, pro sales | DIY focus |\n\nTTSH lags in scale/growth but wins on margins/specialization; FND is closest peer (premium tile focus).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term supplier deals with Mohawk Industries, Dal-Tile; e-commerce with Wayfair/Amazon (minor).\n- **M&A**: None since 2012 Fireclay acquisition; no active rumors (Oct 2024).\n- **Clients**: 90% retail consumers (DIY/remodelers); 10% contractors/designers. Potential majors: Growing pro desk program targeting homebuilders (e.g., D.R. Horton pilots).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Committed to sustainable sourcing (30% recycled content goal by 2025).\n- **Management**: CEO Mark Bohnert (since 2022) focused on efficiency; insider ownership ~5%.\n- **Risks**: Cyclical exposure (80% renovation-driven); inventory turnover slowed to 2.1x (Q2 2024).\n- **Opportunities**: Rate cuts could boost remodels 10-15% (JPMorgan housing outlook, Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 4/10 (**Hold/Sell bias**). Declining sales, housing weakness outweigh debt-free balance sheet and margins. Limited near-term catalysts despite digital pivot.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $8.50 (25% upside). Based on 8x 2025 EV/EBITDA (~$25M est. per consensus) + modest re-rating on housing recovery; assumes 3% comp growth in H2 2025. Suited for moderate-risk growth portfolios, but prefer FND for stronger upside.",

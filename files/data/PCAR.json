Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n- **Strong Parts Business**: Strong Aftermarket Growth: The Parts business is on a roll, hitting record sales and profits. These high-margin, recurring revenues help soften the blow when truck sales slow down.\n\n- **Market Recovery Outlook**: Paccar is expecting a surge in truck demand in the second half of 2025 and 2026, according to CEO Preston Feight. This optimism is centered around order levels and demand for new tractors, which is a promising sign for the company's future growth.\n\n- **Section 232 Tariff Benefits**: However, the new Section 232 tariffs on medium and heavy trucks that will become effective November 1 will be good for PACCAR's customers as it will reduce tariff costs and bring clarity to the market. PACCAR is proud to produce over 90% of its U.S.-sold trucks in Texas, Ohio, and Washington. We look forward to improving market conditions, tariff costs that will begin to reduce as we head towards the end of the year, and PACCAR's continued strong performance.\n\n### Headwinds\n- **Cyclical Market Downturn**: Paccar posted net income of $590 million ($1.12 per diluted share) in the most recent quarter, down 39.3% compared with $972.1 million ($1.85) in the same period a year earlier. The company's revenue in the most recent three-month period totaled $6.67 billion, a decrease of 19% compared with $8.24 billion in Q3 2024.\n\n- **Competitive Pressure**: Competitive Pressure: Major rivals like Daimler, Volvo, and up-and-coming Chinese manufacturers could push prices down and grab market share, particularly in Europe and emerging markets.\n\n- **Supply Chain and Cost Inflation**: Inflation and Input Costs: If prices keep rising for steel, semiconductors, or logistics, PACCAR could see margins shrink—especially if it can't fully pass those costs on to customers.\n\n- **Regulatory Changes**: Regulatory Shifts: Tougher emissions or safety rules could mean big R&D spending and compliance headaches, with the risk of delays to new products.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n### North America\nMarket Share -- CEO Feight said, \"our market share is 30.3% for Peterbilt and Kenworth right now.\"\n\nThe company commands approximately 30% of the Class 8 market share in North America and 15% of the heavy-duty market share in Europe.\n\n### Recent Market Performance\nKenworth and Peterbilt, two of Paccar's brands, have achieved a 30.4% market share in the first six months of 2025.\n\n### Market Context\nHowever, the North American truck market faces headwinds, with 2025 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales projected between 235,000-265,000 units, a downward revision from earlier forecasts.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Main Competitors\nIts biggest rivals: Daimler Truck, Volvo Group, Navistar, and Mitsubishi Fuso.\n\nWhile PACCAR positions itself as a premium \"driver's truck,\" Daimler positions Freightliner as the ultimate \"business tool.\" They aggressively undercut competitors on price-to-value ratios for large fleet orders. Furthermore, Daimler is often a step ahead in vertical integration; their proprietary Detroit Powertrain (engines, axles, and transmissions) is a direct counter to PACCAR's MX engine lineup.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nThese brands are synonymous with premium quality, durability, technology and innovation. The result is a loyal, passionate customer base with strong pride of ownership. PACCAR is exceptionally skilled at factory and distribution operations which, combined with its premium pricing, delivers best in class financial performance.\n\nIts premium-brand reputation, a gigantic dealer network (think 2,200+ dealers across over 100 countries), and a bundle of in-house tech (like its MX engines and digital tools) that help customers squeeze more value out of their fleets.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Toyota Partnership (Hydrogen Fuel Cells)\nTruck manufacturer Paccar Inc. and global automaker Toyota Motor Corp. are moving forward with a partnership to produce fuel cell electric Class 8 trucks for the North American market. John Rich, Paccar's chief technology officer, made the announcement during a May 2 keynote speech here at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo.\n\n### Recent Expansion Activity\nPacLease expanded its franchise network in 2025, adding 17 new locations across the United States. \"PacLease's success in a difficult market reflects the strength of our franchise network and the value we deliver to customers,\" said Ken Roemer, president of PACCAR Leasing. The expansion marks PacLease's broadest network coverage to date, both domestically and globally, as the company celebrated its 45th anniversary.\n\n### Battery Joint Venture\nIn addition to the capital and R&D investments, the Company expects to invest another $400 to $700 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n### Executive Changes\nOn January 14, 2026, PACCAR Inc announced the retirement of Executive Vice President C. Michael Dozier, effective April 1, 2026, after 37 years with the company.\n\n### Dividend Declarations\nPACCAR Inc's Board of Directors today declared an extra cash dividend of one dollar and forty cents ($1.40) per share, payable on January 7, 2026, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 19, 2025.\n\n### Product Recognition\nWe are pleased to share that the DAF XF Electric and XD Electric trucks were honored as International Truck of the Year 2026 by an independent jury of leading European transportation journalists.\n\n### Safety Recall\nPACCAR is recalling over 55,000 Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks due to safety concerns. The recall is related to insufficient illumination from lights, which can decrease the driver's visibility and increase the risk of a crash. The affected models include various Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, manufactured from 2023 to 2026.\n\n## 13.

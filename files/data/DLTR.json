(NASDAQ: DLTR) is a leading U.S. discount variety retailer operating two primary banners: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Dollar Tree stores offer a curated assortment of everyday consumables, household items, seasonal goods, and toys priced at a fixed $1.25 (increased from $1.00 in late 2021), targeting value-conscious shoppers seeking impulse buys in a treasure-hunt format. Family Dollar, acquired in 2015, focuses on consumables like snacks, candy, health/beauty aids, household chemicals, and apparel, with a multi-price point model (most items under $10) appealing to lower-income urban and rural customers who prioritize convenience and one-stop shopping. As of Q2 FY2025 (ended August 3, 2024), the company operates approximately 16,384 stores across 48 U.S. states, Canada, and Puerto Rico, with a total square footage of ~147 million. DLTR emphasizes extreme value positioning amid inflation, generating revenue primarily from store sales (99%+), supported by efficient supply chain and private-label brands. Challenges include Family Dollar's underperformance, leading to aggressive store optimization. FY2024 sales were $30.6B, with ongoing shifts to multi-price testing in Dollar Tree to capture higher-margin sales. The company serves resilient low-to-middle-income consumers, benefiting from macroeconomic pressures that drive traffic to discounters, though it faces intense competition and operational hurdles like shrinkage and labor costs.

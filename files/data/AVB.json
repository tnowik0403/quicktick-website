Company Overview\n\nAvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE: AVB) is a leading multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT) with a 30-year track record of developing, redeveloping, acquiring and managing distinctive apartment communities in some of the best U.S. markets across 12 states and Washington, DC.

The metropolitan areas the company focuses on are characterized by growing employment in high-wage sectors of the economy, lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. These market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community investment relative to other markets.\n\nThe company's principal financial goal is to increase long-term shareholder value through the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership, operation and asset management and, when appropriate, disposition of apartment communities in its markets. AvalonBay is structured as a REIT, which requires it to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.\n\n## 2.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nArlington, Virginia-based apartment REIT AvalonBay Communities announced in its third-quarter earnings call that it plans to focus more resources on build-to-rent development and acquisitions, formally expanding that side of its business. The company intends to focus on townhomes within the build-to-rent sphere. We see BTR growing into a meaningful portion of our portfolio and plan to supplement that growth by investing over $1 billion into BTR through both acquisitions and development.\n\nInitial investments in AvalonBay's build-to-rent business are likely to focus on the REIT's current real estate footprint, particularly suburban areas within Texas, North Carolina and Colorado as markets that could attract the company's attention. This rises to 2,800 homes in 2026, with management expecting an additional 3,000 homes to be delivered in subsequent years.\n\nManagement's guidance for 2026 development starts of roughly $1 billion, with yields in the 6.5% to high-6% range based on current rents and costs, suggests continued discipline.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nAvalonBay is executing a deliberate strategic pivot toward suburban and Sunbelt markets while simultaneously ramping development starts to $1.6 billion in 2025, positioning the company to capture outsized returns when new supply collapses to 20-year lows in 2026. The company's strategic pivot toward suburban and Sunbelt markets, combined with a $3.5 billion development pipeline delivering into a 2026 supply drought, positions AVB to generate 4-6% core FFO growth in 2026-27.\n\nAvalonBay's competitive advantage extends beyond location to its operating model transformation, which generated an incremental $39 million in NOI by year-end 2024, running $2 million ahead of plan. The company is targeting $80 million in annual incremental NOI over the next few years through expanded centralized services, AI adoption, and ancillary revenue streams.\n\nAvalonBay is increasing its presence in suburban markets, aiming for 80% exposure by 2025, up from 73% in 2024.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAvalonBay's primary customers are residential renters seeking high-quality apartment communities in premium metropolitan areas. The company focuses on serving individuals and families seeking rental housing in metropolitan areas. AvalonBay's operations are concentrated in regions characterized by high employment in well-paying sectors and high home ownership costs. The company serves approximately 97,000+ apartment homes across its portfolio, indicating a substantial resident base.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Financial Results\n\nQ3 FFO was $3.01 (EPS $2.68; Core FFO $2.75). The real estate investment trust reported a Core Funds from Operations (FFO) per share of $2.75, significantly surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $1.46. However, the company's revenue for the quarter came in at $766.8 million, falling short of the $777.0 million analysts had projected.\n\nSame Store Residential revenue increased $15,100,000, or 2.3%, to $685,357,000.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Same Store Residential revenue increased $54,483,000, or 2.7%, to $2,043,888,000.\n\n### Full-Year 2025 Guidance\n\n2025 outlook: Core FFO $11.15–$11.35, FFO $11.31–$11.51; Same Store NOI up 1.8–2.2%. Core FFO per Share: Lowered full-year guidance by $0.14 to $11.25 per share, reflecting a 2.2% year-to-year earnings growth. The company revised its full-year core FFO per share guidance down by $0.14 to $11.25, reflecting lower expected earnings growth.\n\n### Development and Capital Position\n\nDevelopment Projects: $3 billion under construction, with a projected yield in the low 6% range.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\n- Third-quarter results were below expectations, with a $0.05 underperformance in core FFO per share due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Apartment demand has been softer than anticipated, attributed to reduced job growth, macroeconomic uncertainty, and lower consumer confidence\n- Legal challenges including multiple lawsuits related to RealPage pricing software allegations and housing discrimination claims\n- With 12% of the resident base employed by the government, the ongoing shutdown and potential future budget cuts create headwinds in the Mid-Atlantic. Film and television jobs in Los Angeles have declined 35% from three years ago\n\n### Tailwinds\n- Same Store fundamentals have softened in Q3 2025 due to macro headwinds, but this near-term noise masks a powerful 2026-27 earnings inflection as AVB's development homes deliver into a supply-starved market with 80 basis points of new inventory, the lowest level since 2012\n- The company also pointed to favorable supply dynamics expected in 2026, with historically low levels of new apartment supply anticipated in its established regions. This reduced competition, combined with the increasing gap between mortgage payments and apartment rents, could support stronger revenue growth in the coming years\n- Technology and AI initiatives expected to drive operational efficiencies\n\n## 9.

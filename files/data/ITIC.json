The company issues title insurance policies and provides ancillary real estate services, focusing on residential and commercial markets in the southeastern and western United States. ITIC's core business involves underwriting title insurance to protect buyers and lenders against losses from title defects, such as liens or ownership disputes. Services extend to closing/escrow, trust services, and investment management for premiums held in escrow.\n\nWith a niche focus on agent-driven distribution (over 90% of policies via independent agents), ITIC emphasizes profitability over volume, maintaining low agent commissions (~15-20%) compared to industry averages (~25-30%). The company operates in 20+ states but derives ~40% of premiums from Texas and ~25% from North Carolina (per 2023 10-K). ITIC avoids direct-to-consumer models, prioritizing high-quality agents to minimize losses. As of Q2 2024, it reported total revenues of $55.4 million (up 1.4% YoY) and net income of $5.7 million (down 21% YoY due to higher claims). With ~$200M in surplus capital, ITIC supports share repurchases (10% outstanding shares retired since 2020) and dividends (recently increased to $0.80/share quarterly). Market cap remains small-cap, with ROE ~15-20% historically, appealing to value-growth investors in a cyclical housing sector.

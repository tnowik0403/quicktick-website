Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $0.72 (Nasdaq, as of market close October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq.com)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $25.8 million (35.8 million shares outstanding, verified via Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $0.65 - $1.43  \n**Primary Exchange:** Nasdaq  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nContext Therapeutics Inc. (ANTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel treatments for solid tumors, particularly in women's cancers like ovarian and breast cancer. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, the company leverages proprietary T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies to harness the immune system against cancer cells expressing specific antigens. Its lead candidate, tivocemab (CTIM-76), is a Claudin 6 x CD3 bispecific antibody designed for Claudin 6-positive tumors, which are prevalent in ~70-90% of ovarian cancers and certain gastric/endometrial cancers. The FDA cleared the IND for CTIM-76 in December 2023, with Phase 1 dosing initiated in Q2 2024. ANTX also advances onapristone extended-release (ONA-XR), a selective progesterone receptor modulator for ER+/PR+ breast cancer, with Phase 3 planning underway following prior Phase 2 data. As a pre-revenue biotech, ANTX relies on equity financing, with a cash runway into mid-2025. The company emphasizes precision oncology, targeting underserved markets with high unmet needs. Recent strategic shifts prioritize CTIM-76 amid the booming bispecific antibody sector, positioning ANTX for potential partnerships or buyouts by larger players in immuno-oncology.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 14, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 financials – R&D expenses $4.9 million (up from $3.7M YoY), G&A $2.1 million, net loss $7.0 million; cash and equivalents $32.1 million (sufficient into H2 2025).\n- **September 10, 2024**: Appointed Dr. Stephanie L.

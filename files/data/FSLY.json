Risks: Hyperscaler encroachment could cap at 1%.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (TTM as of Q2 2024) | FSLY       | Cloudflare (NET) | Akamai (AKAM) | AWS CloudFront |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Revenue                   | $532M     | $1.57B          | $3.88B       | N/A (bundled) |\n| Rev Growth YoY            | +9%       | +29%            | -2%          | +20% est.     |\n| Gross Margin (Non-GAAP)   | 49%       | 79%             | 53%          | 50%+ est.     |\n| Market Cap (Oct 11)       | $893M     | $42B            | $14B         | N/A           |\n| Edge PoPs                 | 102       | 300+            | 4,100+       | 600+          |\n| Strengths vs. FSLY        | -         | Scale/AI        | Enterprise   | Cost/Integrate|\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Major Clients\n- **Partnerships**: The Trade Desk (Oct 3, 2024 ad edge); New Relic (observability); Google Cloud (multi-cloud peering, July 2024).\n- **M&A**: No major since Signal Sciences ($250M, 2021); minor tuck-ins like Ozava (2023).\n- **Current Major Clients**: Pinterest (40% traffic via Fastly), Stripe, Snapchat, DigitalOcean, Veeva Systems (top 10 contribute 25% revenue).\n- **Potential**: Gaming/esports (e.g., Unity talks per earnings), telcos (Edge Nova project).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 6/10 (Hold)**: Moderate growth potential (15% CAGR) offset by profitability risks and competition. Strong edge positioning for AI tailwinds, but execution needed for FCF scaling. Recent FCF positivity and Q3 guide (+11% YoY mid) support holding; upside if AI ramps.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $9.50** (50% upside): DCF-based (15% discount rate, 18% 5-yr revenue CAGR, 15% terminal margins, per analyst consensus Bloomberg Oct 2024 avg $10.20). Suits growth portfolios with moderate risk; catalysts: Q3 earnings (Oct 30 est.), AI adoption. Risks: Miss guide (-20% downside to $5).",

Blaize Holdings has 121,136,140 shares outstanding.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n### Core Technology Platform\nTHE BLAIZE® GRAPH STREAMING PROCESSOR (GSP®) architecture is powerful, energy efficient and adaptable to overcome the limits on computing that keep AI, machine learning and deep learning from doing all it can do. With 16 TOPS AI inference performance at 7W power, 50x less memory bandwidth, and 10x lower latency, GSP-based platforms deliver up to 60% greater systems efficiency, the metric that matters on the edge, and with the flexibility of a 100% programmable processor.\n\n### Hardware Products\nRealize the awesome potential of AI with the new Blaize® Pathfinder® and Blaize® Xplorer® AI Edge Platforms that are more efficient, more flexible, more accurate and more cost effective. The Pathfinder® P1600 platform, awarded the 2022 Product of the Year by the Edge AI and Vision Alliance, exemplifies Blaize's commitment to excellence in AI and computer vision.\n\n- **Blaize Pathfinder P1600**: The P1600 embedded Systems on Module (SOM) claims to bring the programmability and efficiency benefits of the GSP to embedded edge AI applications deployed at the sensor edge, or on the network edge. No host processor is needed for the P1600, just plug it in and go.\n\n- **Blaize Xplorer X1600E**: This is an accelerator form factor available from Blaize due to the efficiency of the GSP – and can be easily added to accelerate AI apps in industrial PCs or as a rack of cards in a small 1U server.\n\n- **Blaize Xplorer X1600P**: The X1600P is a standard PCIe-based accelerator in a half-height, half-width form factor. The X1600P can easily replace a power-hungry desktop GPU in edge servers and provide anywhere from 16-64TOPS of AI inference performance within a very low power envelope.\n\n### Software Suite\nAI Studio is the first open and code-free software platform to span the complete edge AI operational workflow, dramatically reducing deployment time, complexity, cost and efficiency. AI Studio is built as an accessible platform for all non-developers – domain experts, AI teams, devops teams – to put AI ideas into production quickly and easily.\n\nThe Blaize AI software suite is built on open standards with ease of accessibility to liberate product developers from being locked to proprietary development environments. Comprised of the Picasso software development kit (SDK), and AI Studio, a completely code-free visual interface, the software suite offers tools for both traditional developers and non-coder domain experts.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nWe are also continuing development of our next-generation chip, working closely with ecosystem partners to extend our leadership in low-power programmable AI. Next-generation chip progress -- Development continues with expectations of improved margins as more GSP-heavy servers are shipped starting in the second half of 2026.\n\nA representative from Blaize explained that the next generation chip will address existing video image visual workloads and expand into other areas to capture a wider set of workloads. This expansion is expected to improve margins and include newer AI models, such as language models, due to the programmable and flexible architecture of Blaize's platform.\n\nFor scalable, rack-mounted edge AI deployments, Blaize's technology is also available in Supermicro's 1U server system featuring 24 Blaize® GSP® Xplorer® X1600 EDSFF accelerators. This compact form factor delivers high-density inference performance for city-wide, industrial, and defense infrastructure – at a fraction of the energy and cooling costs of traditional GPU-heavy servers.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nBlaize expects continued momentum through Q4 2025 and into FY 2026, driven by disciplined execution, expanding platform-driven revenue, and strong customer demand. Blaize's Hybrid AI platform engagements continue with Yotta in India and Starshine in Asia, while new collaborations with TCC and REACH Digital in the Middle East highlight growing regional interest and validate the platform's relevance to emerging AI infrastructure needs. Blaize continues to strengthen its operations while advancing its integrated AI platform portfolio, supported by strategic investment in next-generation silicon and software innovation.\n\nIn 2026, the company aims to accelerate commercialization of Practical AI globally and continue to contribute to the global AI inference infrastructure build-out, including opportunities with cloud and communications service providers driving next-generation data center expansion.\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including advancing commercialization of the Blaize AI platform across key verticals in growth markets where customer demand continues to accelerate, as well as continued development of the Company's next-generation chip.\n\n## 6.

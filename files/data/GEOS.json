Daily Volume: 124,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview\nGeospace Technologies Corporation (GEOS) is a technology provider specializing in instruments and equipment for seismic data acquisition, reservoir monitoring, and processing, primarily serving the oil & gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company operates through three main segments: Seismographs (high-performance geophones, hydrophones, and wireless nodal systems for land/marine seismic surveys), Oilfield Products (reservoir monitoring like GROOVE technology and subsea connectors), and Emerging Growth (wireless sensing solutions including Sense Bluetooth for industrial IoT and BioWave medical devices for non-invasive pain therapy). \n\nFounded in 1980, GEOS has evolved from seismic hardware manufacturing to a diversified tech firm, with ~70% of FY2024 revenue from oil & gas amid volatile exploration cycles. It holds a niche in next-gen wireless nodes (e.g., FireFly system), reducing deployment costs vs. traditional cabled geophones. Beyond energy, Emerging Growth targets healthcare (BioWave Go/Plus devices sold via distributors) and industrial sensing, aiming for recurring revenue. With ~250 employees, GEOS reported FY2024 revenue of $157.0 million (down 13% YoY) but swung to net income of $13.9 million from a $1.4 million loss in FY2023, driven by cost controls and product mix. The firm emphasizes R&D (e.g., OBX marine sources), positioning for offshore/LNG demand resurgence. Market cap ~$143M reflects cyclical risks but undervalues IP in seismic tech and medtech diversification.

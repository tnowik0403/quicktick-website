(ROCK) is a leading manufacturer, distributor, and provider of engineered products and services primarily serving the U.S. residential construction, renewable energy, infrastructure, and commercial markets. Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Buffalo, New York, the company operates through four main segments: Renewables (solar racking and trackers), Residential (ladders, ventilation, and grilling products), Infrastructure & Safety (guardrails, perimeter fencing), and Emerging Businesses (low voltage electrical and pool products). \n\nROCK's portfolio emphasizes value-added fabrication, assembly, and distribution, with a focus on high-margin, engineered solutions that reduce installation time and costs for customers. In renewables, it supplies ground-mount and rooftop solar racking systems under brands like IronRidge, capturing growing U.S. solar demand. Residential products include premium ladders (e.g., Louisville Ladder) and ventilation systems for attics and roofs. Infrastructure offerings target highway safety and fencing for utilities/municipalities. \n\nThe company has transformed from a commoditized distributor to a growth-oriented platform via strategic M&A and organic expansion, achieving a 15-20% CAGR in sales over the past 5 years. With ~1,700 employees and 50+ facilities across North America, ROCK generated $1.46 billion in FY2023 revenue, positioning it as a mid-cap leader in niche building products amid housing shortages and clean energy transitions.

Compelling solar tailwinds, backlog visibility, and margin leverage outweigh residential cyclicality. Moderate risk via diversification/debt-free balance sheet.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $115 (30% upside). Based on 12x 2025E EBITDA ($220M projected), 20% discount to peers for mid-cap status.

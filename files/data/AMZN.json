(AMZN) is currently trading at approximately $247.45 with a market capitalization of $2.64 trillion. The stock has shown strong momentum in early 2026, rebounding from its underperformance in 2025. Amazon's stock rose only about 5-6% in 2025, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's 16-18% return. However, the company is experiencing positive momentum in early 2026, highlighted by a 5% increase in stock value and upgraded price targets from analysts.\n\n---\n\n## **COMPANY OVERVIEW**\n\nAmazon.com Inc. operates as a diversified technology company with three primary business segments:\n\n**Core Business Lines:**\n- **E-commerce & Retail**: Online marketplace, Prime subscription services, physical stores\n- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud computing, AI services, enterprise solutions  \n- **Advertising & Digital Media**: Digital advertising, Prime Video, content creation\n- **Emerging Technologies**: AI chips (Trainium), satellite internet (Project Kuiper), healthcare (One Medical)\n\nAs of January 2026, Amazon stands at a pivotal junction between its heritage as the world's most dominant e-commerce platform and its future as a vertically integrated AI and infrastructure powerhouse. The Amazon of 2026 is increasingly defined by its high-margin cloud services, sophisticated generative AI stack, and a burgeoning satellite internet constellation.\n\n---\n\n## **RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**\n\n### **Q3 2025 Results (Most Recent Earnings):**\nNet sales increased 13% to $180.2 billion in Q3, compared with $158.9 billion in Q3 2024.

(NYSE: BILL) is a leading cloud-based financial automation platform tailored for small and midsize businesses (SMBs), enabling streamlined accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR), invoicing, and spend management. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in San Jose, California, BILL went public in December 2019. Its core platform integrates seamlessly with popular accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero, and Sage, processing over $100B+ in annualized payment volume across 450,000+ customers (as of Q2 FY2025). BILL's ecosystem goes beyond basic payments by offering embedded banking services, expense tracking via its Divvy subsidiary (acquired 2021), and AI-driven insights for cash flow optimization. The company targets the $20B+ U.S. SMB fintech market, where manual financial processes cost businesses $1T+ annually in inefficiencies. BILL's freemium-to-premium model drives high customer retention (114% net revenue retention in Q2 FY2025), with revenue primarily from subscription fees (40%), transaction fees (50%), and interest on cash balances.

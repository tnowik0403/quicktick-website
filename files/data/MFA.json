(NYSE: MFA), founded in 1993 and headquartered in New York City, is a diversified real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in mortgage-related assets. The company primarily invests in a portfolio of non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), Agency RMBS, credit risk transfer (CRT) securities, residential whole loans, and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). As of June 30, 2024, MFA's investment portfolio totaled $7.9 billion, generating returns through net interest income (spread between asset yields and funding costs) and potential principal appreciation. MFA employs leverage (typically 4-6x equity) via repurchase agreements, securitizations, and other financing, while maintaining a focus on credit selection to mitigate losses in non-Agency assets (which comprise ~70% of the portfolio). The firm is externally managed by Anagen Management, LP, with a management fee structure tied to equity book value. MFA distributes at least 90% of taxable income as dividends to maintain REIT status, offering shareholders a consistent yield. Recent portfolio shifts emphasize higher-yielding non-Agency RMBS and MSRs, positioning MFA to benefit from elevated interest rates while navigating prepayment and extension risks. With a market cap of $1.15B, MFA operates in the $500B+ mREIT sector, targeting total returns of 8-12% annually through active management.

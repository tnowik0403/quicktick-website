Operating through two main segments—Pet (approximately 55% of revenue) and Garden (45%)—the company offers a diverse portfolio of consumer products sold via specialty retailers (e.g., PetSmart, Petco), mass merchants (e.g., Walmart, Target), home centers (e.g., Home Depot, Lowe's), and e-commerce channels. \n\nIn the Pet segment, CENT provides durable chews (Nylabone), flea/tick control (Adams), pet beds/accessories (Four Paws), aquatics (Pinnacle), and bird/wildlife products (Kaytee). The Garden segment includes grass seed (Pennington), fertilizers/pest control (Lawn Doctor, Sevin), live plants (Bell Nortex), and pottery (GKI). With over 6,500 employees and a network of distribution centers, CENT emphasizes innovation, premiumization, and sustainability to capture consumer trends like pet humanization and outdoor living. Fiscal 2024 (ended Sep 29, 2024) delivered net sales of $3.31 billion, reflecting resilience amid sector challenges, with Pet sales up 4% to $1.81 billion driven by share gains in chews and aquatics, offset by a 5% Garden decline to $1.50 billion due to weather and inventory dynamics. Gross margins expanded to 29.5% from cost efficiencies. Headquartered in Walnut Creek, CA, CENT trades at a current price of $44.25 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq), with a market capitalization of $2.46 billion (55.6 million shares outstanding). The company maintains a debt-light balance sheet and focuses on organic growth plus bolt-on M&A to build category leadership.

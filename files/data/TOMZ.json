(TOMZ) is a global infection prevention and decontamination company specializing in Binary Ionization Technology (BIT™), a patented two-stage process that activates aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into a fine mist for broad-spectrum disinfection. Headquartered in Beverly Hills, CA, with manufacturing in Alabama, TOMZ targets high-risk environments like healthcare, pharmaceuticals, aviation, food processing, and government facilities. Its flagship SteraMist™ platform—including the iHP Corporate Use Applicator (CUA), Binary Ionization Travel Unit (BITTU), and Surface Unit (SU)—delivers EPA-registered, FDA-cleared, and CDC-recommended solutions that inactivate 99.99% of pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2, C. difficile, and MRSA) without damaging surfaces or leaving residues. Post-COVID, TOMZ has pivoted from pandemic-driven sales to recurring revenue via service contracts, equipment rentals, and chemical replenishment. With a focus on biosecurity amid rising antimicrobial resistance and outbreaks, the company serves regulated sectors requiring validated decontamination. FY2023 revenue was ~$4M (down from pandemic peaks), but Q2 2024 showed sharp recovery.

(CCC) is a leading SaaS provider powering the $1 trillion+ U.S. property & casualty (P&C) insurance economy. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, CCC delivers cloud-native platforms that digitize and automate workflows across the insurance lifecycle—from claims intake and repair estimating to parts procurement, total loss valuation, and collision repair management. Its solutions serve three core customer segments: insurers (e.g., auto, property claims), repairers (e.g., body shops), and OEMs/suppliers (e.g., parts marketplaces). \n\nCCC processes ~95 million claims annually, enabling data-driven decisions that reduce cycle times by 20-30% and costs by 10-15%. With 80%+ recurring subscription revenue, CCC holds dominant market positions: ~75% share in U.S. auto physical damage estimating, ~70% in total loss valuations, and ~60% in repairer shop management. The company leverages proprietary data networks (e.g., 25+ years of claims data) and AI/ML for predictive insights. Post-2021 SPAC merger (via Motive Technologies), CCC has expanded internationally (UK, Canada) and into adjacencies like fleet telematics and health/safety compliance. In H1 2024, it served 500+ insurer clients and 40,000+ repair facilities, underscoring its \"network effect\" moat in a fragmented $20B+ TAM.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\nNet sales decreased 5% to $1.11 billion during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $1.17 billion in the prior-year third quarter. Core sales, which excludes both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency, decreased approximately 6%.\n\nGenerac Holdings Inc. GNRC reported third-quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.83, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.25. GNRC reported adjusted EPS of $2.25 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nResidential product sales decreased approximately 13% to $627 million as compared to $723 million last year. Commercial & Industrial (\"C&I\") product sales increased approximately 9% to $358 million as compared to $328 million in the prior year.\n\n### Full Year 2024 Performance\nIn 2024, Generac Holdings's revenue was $4.30 billion, an increase of 6.79% compared to the previous year's $4.02 billion.

GNRC now expects free cash flow conversion from adjusted net income to be 80% compared with the previous guided range of 90% to 100%.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nHome standby and portable generator shipments grew sequentially in the quarter but were below seasonal expectations as a result of a power outage environment that was significantly below our long-term baseline average and the lowest third quarter of total outage hours that we've experienced since 2015.\n\nThe decrease in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix together with the impact of higher tariffs and lower manufacturing absorption, partially offset by increased price realization.\n\n### Tailwinds\nThe mega-trends that support our future growth potential remain intact as lower power quality and higher power prices will be an ongoing challenge given the more frequent and severe weather patterns and broader electrification trends. Importantly, the massive increase in data center power demand is expected to further stress the already fragile power grid by amplifying the growing electricity supply/demand imbalance.\n\nWith global demand for data center capacity projected to more than triple by 2030 (McKinsey), the rapid expansion of data centers is creating unprecedented demand for reliable and scalable power solutions.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nGenerac commands a substantial 75% market share in North America's residential standby generator market.

(GNRC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 25, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $166.83  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $9.51 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $115.00 - $185.04  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 40.68  \n- **Forward P/E**: 25.32  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nGenerac Holdings Inc. (NYSE: GNRC) is a leading global provider of energy technology solutions, specializing in backup and prime power generation systems. Founded in 1959 and headquartered in Waukesha, Wisconsin, the company designs, manufactures, and sells a wide range of generators and energy management products for residential, commercial, light-commercial, and industrial (C&I) markets. Its core offerings include home standby generators (automatic backup during outages), portable generators, and increasingly, clean energy solutions like solar-plus-storage systems via its PWRcell brand. Generac dominates the U.S. residential standby generator market, benefiting from rising demand driven by extreme weather events, aging grid infrastructure, and growing interest in energy resilience and electrification. The company has expanded beyond traditional fossil-fuel generators into smart home energy ecosystems, including energy storage, EV charging, and smart thermostats through recent acquisitions. With ~10,000 employees and operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, Generac reported Q2 2024 net sales of $1.015 billion (verified from August 1, 2024 earnings release on generac.com/IR). Its \"Connected Products\" segment, encompassing energy storage and management, now represents a key growth pillar amid the shift to distributed energy resources.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024)**: Net sales $1.015B (-14% YoY); adjusted EBITDA $214M (margin 21.1%); residential segment sales $531M (-27% YoY due to post-COVID normalization); C&I segment $361M (+13% YoY).

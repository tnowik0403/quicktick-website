(NASDAQ: HYPR) is a pioneering health technology company focused on disrupting traditional MRI imaging with portable, low-field MRI systems. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Guilford, Connecticut, Hyperfine went public in August 2021 via a SPAC merger with TriplePoint BioVenture Growth, Inc. The company's mission is to democratize access to MRI by delivering the world's first FDA-cleared portable MRI system, Swoop® Portable MR Imaging® System, which weighs ~2,400 lbs (vs. traditional 10,000+ lbs room-sized units) and operates near a standard electrical outlet without shielding. Priced under $250K (vs. $1-3M for conventional MRIs), Swoop enables point-of-care neuroimaging in settings like NICUs, ERs, ICUs, clinics, and underserved/rural areas, reducing scan times, transport risks, and costs. Revenue streams include system sales/leases (~60-day payment terms), service contracts, and accessories. As of Q2 2024, Hyperfine has ~140 cumulative systems shipped/placed across U.S. (~100 active sites), with international expansion underway (FDA export certs for 20+ countries). The company targets a $50B+ global MRI market, emphasizing AI-enhanced software for automated workflows. Challenges include scaling commercialization amid high R&D burn and reimbursement hurdles, but Swoop's ultraportability positions it for tele-radiology and AI integration growth.

Moderate risk appetite suits Hold; wait for Nasdaq compliance/reverse split. Upside if 2025 rev hits $15M+ (AI/exports). Downside to $0.50 on further dilution.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $1.80** (DCF-based: 25% discount rate, 50% rev CAGR to 2027, terminal 8x EV/Rev on $100M rev; peers comp). ~150% upside from $0.71; target 12-18 mo.  \n\n*Data sourced: SEC filings (8-K/Q2 10Q Aug 14, 2024), Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha transcripts, company IR site, Grand View Research (Oct 2024).*",

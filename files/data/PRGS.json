Daily Volume**: 375,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nProgress Software Corporation (Nasdaq: PRGS), founded in 1981 and headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, is a global infrastructure software provider empowering over 1,200 enterprise customers—including 80 of the Fortune 100—to build, deploy, and manage mission-critical applications. The company focuses on simplifying complex IT environments through a portfolio of low-code/no-code platforms, application development tools, secure file transfer solutions, API management, and network monitoring software. Key offerings like OpenEdge (a robust application platform for business-critical apps), MOVEit (managed file transfer), and WhatsUp Gold (network monitoring) address developer productivity, data security, and operational efficiency.\n\nProgress operates in the $50B+ application infrastructure and middleware market, emphasizing recurring revenue via SaaS and subscription models (92% of bookings from subscriptions/ARR as of Q2 FY2024). Post the high-profile MOVEit cyber breach in May 2023 (affecting millions via zero-day exploit), the company invested heavily in security enhancements, boosting resilience while navigating litigation. With FY2023 revenue of $703M (up 11% YoY) and a shift to 14% ARR growth in recent quarters, Progress targets digital transformation amid AI and cloud adoption. Its \"customer success\" ethos, evidenced by 98% gross retention, positions it as a steady player in a fragmented sector, though legacy on-prem exposure tempers hypergrowth.

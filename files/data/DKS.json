The goal is to reach between 75 and 100 House of Sport locations nationwide by the end of fiscal year 2027. House of Sport locations (approximately 120,000 sq ft) generate around $35 million in sales with a cash-on-cash return of approximately 25% and a payback period of less than 4 years. The smaller DICK'S Field House format (approximately 50,000 sq ft) delivers about $14 million in sales with an impressive 40% cash-on-cash return and a 2.5-year payback period.\n\n### Foot Locker Integration\nOn September 8, 2025, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Foot Locker, Inc. (\"Foot Locker\"), a leading footwear and apparel retailer, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement executed on May 15, 2025. Total consideration exchanged for the acquisition was $2.5 billion, which primarily consisted of $2.1 billion in share consideration for the issuance of 9.6 million shares of DICK'S Sporting Goods common stock, $223.0 million in cash consideration and $111.6 million from the Company's pre-existing equity ownership in Foot Locker.\n\n### GameChanger Growth\nThe company's youth sports technology platform, GameChanger, has shown remarkable growth with over $100 million in sales (up 49% year-over-year) and approximately 9 million unique active users (up 22%). DICK'S is targeting $150 million in revenue for GameChanger in 2025.\n\n### Infrastructure Development\nTo support future growth, construction of a new regional distribution center is slated to begin in 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nDICK'S operates a three-pillar growth strategy:\n\n### Experiential Retail\nHouse of Sport stores are experiential locations with amenities such as climbing walls and batting cages. These approximately 120,000-square-foot experiential stores feature climbing walls, batting cages, and other interactive elements designed to create immersive shopping experiences.\n\n### Digital Transformation\nDICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.'s DKS digital strategy is a key growth catalyst, underscoring its rapid evolution into a leading omnichannel sports retailer. DKS' GameChanger platform and the Dick's Media Network are significant pillars fueling long-term digital revenue streams. The company is making bold strides in digital transformation, leveraging its omnichannel capabilities to drive sustainable growth. While GameChanger serves as a high-margin growth engine, Dick's Media Network is a retail media platform that capitalizes on the growing scorecard loyalty program and customer data ecosystem.\n\n### Omnichannel Integration\nOver 65% of FY24 sales came from omni-channel customers, who spend more than twice as much as single-channel customers. Additionally, more than 90% of sales were enabled by stores, and over 80% of online orders were fulfilled by stores in FY24.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nDICK'S serves a diverse customer base they refer to as \"athletes.\" Key customer segments include:\n\n• **Youth Sports Families** - It's a $40 billion dollar annual market according to the Aspen Institute, with spending per child for a primary sport averaging $1,016 in 2024, up 46% in 2024 from 2019. Stack often says his business is more insulated from macroeconomic pressures because of its youth athlete consumer, as parents aren't often shoving a growing child's feet into last year's cleats.\n\n• **GameChanger Users** - A GameChanger customer who also has a Dick's ScoreCard spends over 2 times more per year at Dick's than a typical ScoreCard member. With customers visiting the app over 13 times a month, we believe there are numerous opportunities for Dick's to reach these customers in unique and authentic ways to drive brand loyalty and sales.\n\n• **Omnichannel Customers** - DICK'S emphasized its growing digital presence, noting that over 65% of FY24 sales came from omnichannel customers who spend twice as much as single-channel shoppers.\n\nThe company serves both individual consumers and institutional clients through its GameChanger platform, which hosts millions of youth sports teams and events.\n\n## 7.

(DCI) is a global leader in engineered filtration solutions, designing, manufacturing, and selling filtration systems and replacement parts worldwide. Founded in 1915 and headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota, the company operates through three main segments: Engine Products (65% of FY2024 sales), Industrial Products (25%), and Aerospace Products (10%). Engine Products serve heavy-duty mobile equipment (construction, mining, agriculture) and on-road/off-road engines with air, fuel, oil, and hydraulic filters. Industrial Products focus on industrial air and gas filtration for manufacturing, power generation, and pharma/food sectors. Aerospace provides aftermarket filters for military and commercial aircraft engines. With ~14,000 employees across 140+ locations in 30+ countries, Donaldson emphasizes innovation in filtration efficiency, emissions control, and sustainability. FY2024 (ended Oct 31, 2024) delivered record sales of $3.52 billion (up 5% YoY), driven by aftermarket strength and Industrial segment growth, amid stabilizing supply chains post-COVID. The company benefits from secular tailwinds in electrification, emissions regulations (e.g., Euro 7, EPA standards), and industrial automation, positioning it as a resilient mid-cap industrial player with strong margins (FY2024 operating margin 17.4%) and a 50+ year dividend aristocrat streak.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Nov 7, 2024)**: Net sales $906.1M (+5% YoY organic); EPS $0.91 (beat estimates); full-year sales $3.52B (+5%), EPS $3.73 (+9%).

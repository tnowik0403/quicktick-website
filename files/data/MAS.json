Founded in 1929 and headquartered in Livonia, Michigan, Masco operates through two main segments: Plumbing Products (71% of 2023 sales) and Decorative Architectural Products (29%). The Plumbing segment includes premium faucets, showers, bath hardware, and kitchen products under brands like Delta Faucet Company (U.S. market leader), Hansgrohe (luxury European brand), and Brasstech. The Decorative Architectural segment features paints, stains, and coatings via Behr Paint Company (exclusive to Home Depot) and cabinetry/door hardware through brands like KraftMaid and Merillat.\n\nMasco's strategy emphasizes innovation in water efficiency, smart home integration, and sustainability, targeting both DIY consumers and professional contractors. With ~19,000 employees, the company generates the majority of revenue (80%+) from North America, with growing international exposure via Hansgrohe. Masco benefits from the massive U.S. R&R market (~$500B annually), driven by aging housing stock (average home age 40+ years) rather than new construction. It maintains strong brand loyalty, high margins (adj. operating margin ~20%), and shareholder returns via dividends (yield ~1.2%) and buybacks ($1.5B authorized remaining as of Q3 2024). Challenges include cyclicality tied to housing and interest rates, but Masco's R&R focus provides resilience vs. pure new-build peers.

Chirantan \"CJ\" Desai, who has spent the past year as president of product and engineering at Cloudflare, is replacing Ittycheria, effective Nov. 10, MongoDB said. Ittycheria will remain on the company's board.\n\nPrior to Cloudflare, Desai served as President and Chief Operating Officer at ServiceNow, where he helped organically scale the company from $1.5 billion to over $10 billion in annualized revenue.\n\n### Strategic Acquisition - Voyage AI (February 2025)\nDatabase company MongoDB Inc. said it's acquiring Voyage AI for $220 million in a cash-and-stock deal to fast-track its ability to help its customers build artificial intelligence-powered applications.\n\nIntegrating Voyage AI's technology with MongoDB will enable organizations to easily build trustworthy, AI-powered applications by offering highly accurate and relevant information retrieval deeply integrated with operational data.\n\n### Strong Q3 FY2026 Preliminary Results\nMongoDB also said it expects to exceed the high end of its guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter. The top end of its range was 79 cents per share in earnings, and $592 million in revenue. Desai said he's \"looking forward to grow MongoDB to $5 billion-plus in a durable, profitable way, in revenues, and most importantly, to be the gold standard for modern database technology, no matter what kind of workloads exist.\"\n\n---\n\n## Growth Strategy & AI Focus\n\n### AI Application Development Platform\nMongoDB has positioned itself as the foundational platform for AI applications through several strategic initiatives:\n\n1. **MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP)**: Launched in the summer of 2024—with founding members Accenture, Anthropic, Anyscale, Arcee AI, AWS, Cohere, Credal, Fireworks AI, Google Cloud, gravity9, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Microsoft Azure, Nomic, PeerIslands, Pureinsights, and Together AI—By joining the MAAP partner network, Capgemini, Confluent, IBM, QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and Unstructured are helping the program evolve to meet the ever-changing AI landscape, and offering customers an array of leading solutions.\n\n2. **Vector Search Capabilities**: MongoDB Atlas Vector Search was named the most loved and second-most used vector database on the market for the second year in a row in Retool's 2024 State of AI report. Since introducing Atlas Vector Search last year, MongoDB has quickly become a trusted partner for customers looking to build powerful AI applications.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Modernization**: MongoDB Launches AI-Powered Application Modernization Platform to Reduce Technical Debt and Speed Innovation\n\n### Cloud-First Strategy\nAtlas grew 24% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 71% of total revenue compared to 68% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and 68% last quarter. Atlas revenue is recognized primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of their applications\n\n---\n\n## Market Position & Competition\n\n### NoSQL Market Leadership\nThe top three of MongoDB's competitors in the NoSQL Databases category are NoSQL with 22.16%, Amazon DynamoDB with 11.13%, Hbase with 3.96% market share.\n\nAs of mid-2025 MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL/document database and ranks in the top-5 overall on DB-Engines, behind Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL. Gartner placed MongoDB as a Leader in its Cloud DBMS Magic Quadrant\n\n### Competitive Landscape Analysis\n\n**Key Strengths vs. PostgreSQL:**\nMongoDB provides more flexibility than PostgreSQL when it comes to data modeling, horizontal scalability, and overall developer productivity.\n\nOne, a lot of people do compare MongoDB to Postgres. And I think that's actually a false comparison because Postgres is just an OLTP database. With MongoDB, the right comparison is Postgres plus Elastic plus something like Pinecone plus maybe like an embedding model from like either like Open AI or Cohere. So, when you package all those components together, you get a like-for-like comparison with MongoDB. And I think obviously, customers much prefer to have a much more elegant solution than trying to cobble all these pieces together and try and figure out how to make it all work.\n\n**Hyperscaler Competition:**\nHyperscaler offerings (AWS DocumentDB, Google Firestore, Azure Cosmos DB) create price and integration pressure on Atlas despite MongoDB's multi-cloud footprint and developer ecosystem.\n\nMicrosoft has also recently announced a distributed PostgreSQL database service – HorizonDB – designed to rival other hyperscaler systems and third-party RDBMSes such as CockroachDB and YugabyteDB. Claiming 100 percent compatibility with open source PostgreSQL, Microsoft said the database service available on Azure would implement a new storage layer that significantly improves performance, scalability, and availability of the database compared to its other PostgreSQL services. It rivals distributed PostgreSQL services from Google (AlloyDB) and AWS (Aurora DSQL). To add even more into the mix, Microsoft has launched a document database platform to rival MongoDB. DocumentDB is constructed on a relational PostgreSQL back end and can use FerretDB as a front-end interface with a document database protocol.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\n### Major Cloud Provider Relationships\nMongoDB has extensive relationships with the three major cloud providers -- AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud -- and continues to deepen partnerships as the market evolves. Recently, the company has partnered with the cloud providers to focus on training models for natural language code completion generation, and has developed integrations with cloud providers and managed LLM services, including deeper integrations across Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI and Microsoft Azure OpenAI. For example, MongoDB recently announced the general availability of MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes on both AWS and Google Cloud, which provide dedicated infrastructure to scale generative AI and relevance-based search workloads with up to 60 percent faster query times.\n\n### AI Ecosystem Partnerships\nIn addition, MongoDB is also working with AI trailblazers like Cohere, Codeium, Patronus, Together AI, Fireworks AI and Voxel 51, and the company only expects its list of AI partners to only grow.\n\n### 2025 Partner Awards Recognition\nWe are proud to recognize Microsoft for exceptional year-over-year growth as MongoDB's Global Cloud Partner of the Year. Together, MongoDB and Microsoft have delivered strong momentum across industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, and financial services, helping organizations build great applications that deliver exceptional customer experiences. Microsoft's deep commitment to collaboration, customer success, and cloud leadership makes it an indispensable part of MongoDB's partner ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## Market Trends & Growth Opportunities\n\n### NoSQL Market Growth\nThe NoSQL Market is expected to reach USD 15.04 billion in 2025 and grow at a CAGR of 29.85% to reach USD 55.51 billion by 2030. Amazon Web Services, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC, MongoDB, Inc. and Couchbase, Inc. are the major companies operating in this market.\n\n### AI-Driven Database Demand\nMongoDB remains the king of flexible schemas and horizontal scaling. Its Atlas Vector Search and Queryable Encryption 2.0 in 2025 make it even more appealing for modern AI-powered apps and privacy-first architectures. MongoDB remains the king of flexible schemas and horizontal scaling. Its Atlas Vector Search and Queryable Encryption 2.0 in 2025 make it even more appealing for modern AI-powered apps and privacy-first architectures.\n\n### Developer Adoption Trends\nThe database landscape in 2025 is more competitive than ever. With PostgreSQL evolving into a powerhouse of relational and semi-structured data capabilities, and MongoDB doubling down on distributed performance and developer-friendly workflows, the choice between the two isn't as straightforward as it used to be. If you're building a scalable backend, data-intensive SaaS, or real-time analytics system, understanding their latest capabilities is essential before making the call.\n\n---\n\n## Risk Factors & Headwinds\n\n### Competitive Pressures\n1. **Hyperscaler Competition**: AWS DocumentDB, Azure Cosmos DB, and Google Firestore present pricing and integration challenges\n2. **PostgreSQL Evolution**: But by 2023, relational system PostgreSQL had become the most popular database among professional developers in the Stack Overflow survey.

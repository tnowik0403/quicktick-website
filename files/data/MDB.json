The company provides MongoDB Atlas, a hosted multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution; MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, a commercial database server for enterprise customers to run in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment; and Community Server, a free-to-download version of its database, which includes the functionality that developers need to get started with MongoDB.\n\nMongoDB offers a powerful and flexible document database that enables organizations to store, retrieve, and analyze large amounts of unstructured data in real-time. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB's document model allows for greater scalability, faster performance, and easier data integration.

Company Overview\n\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc. operates as a financial technology company that connects people and financial institutions through technology solutions and payment processing services. It operates through four segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. \n\nFounded in 1976, the American company is devoted to financial technology and payment processing services, mostly for community banks and credit unions. The company empowers approximately 7,400 clients with people-inspired innovation, personal service, and insight-driven solutions that help reduce the barriers to financial health. \n\nThe company's brilliance lies in its 91% recurring revenue base. Once a bank integrates JKHY's core software, the \"switching costs\" are prohibitively high, creating a deep economic moat. JKHY primarily makes money by selling and servicing integrated technology solutions-core processing, payment systems, and complementary products-to community and regional financial institutions in a high-margin, recurring revenue model.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 22, 2026, JKHY's stock price hovers around $191.00, reflecting its status as a \"defensive growth\" asset. As of 1/2/2026, Market Cap is 12.91B, Enterprise Value is 12.89B. PE Ratio (TTM) is 28.16, EPS (TTM) is 6.59. Forward Dividend & Yield is 2.32 (1.28%). The Jack Henry & Associates 52-week high stock price is 196.00, which is 3% above the current share price. The Jack Henry & Associates 52-week low stock price is 144.12, which is 24.3% below the current share price.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nJack Henry operates a diverse, recurring-revenue-heavy model that segments its business into three primary categories: Core: This is the \"brain\" of the bank. It includes central processing systems for general ledgers, deposits, and loans. Payments: This segment handles ATM/debit/credit card processing, bill pay, and electronic money movement (ACH). Complementary: This includes specialized \"add-on\" modules like digital banking (Banno), lending, risk management, and cybersecurity.\n\nFor banks, Jack Henry offers three distinct core systems: SilverLake for larger commercial banks, CIF 20/20 for mid-sized institutions, and Core Director for smaller banks. Symitar is the dominant core system for credit unions with over $1 billion in assets. Banno Digital Platform: This is the flagship consumer-facing digital banking suite. It consistently ranks among the highest-rated banking apps in the Apple App Store.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nMeanwhile, CTO Ben Metz is credited with driving \"The Jack Henry Platform,\" an initiative designed to move all services to a cloud-native, API-first environment on Google Cloud. Innovation at Jack Henry is currently defined by the \"Jack Henry Platform.\" Unlike competitors who often force banks into \"big bang\" legacy replacements, JKHY allows institutions to modernize piece-by-piece.\n\nThe company is building a comprehensive, cloud-native platform that unifies core, digital, and all other services into a single, adaptable ecosystem. Jack Henry says it is on track for an H1 2026 launch of its public cloud-native consumer and commercial deposit-only core, ahead of schedule. 15 core components are live, and many are used internally and externally.\n\nJack Henry (Nasdaq: JKHY) on Jan 12, 2026 announced Jack Henry Rapid Transfers, a cloud-native solution that enables immediate, secure me-to-me money movement using debit rails via Visa Direct and Mastercard Move. Rolled out beginning in September, Rapid Transfers is live with 65 financial institutions and has 170 more in implementation. The solution is fully integrated with the Banno Digital Platform, which serves over 1,000 financial institutions and more than 15 million registered users as of Nov 30, 2025.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nWith a clean balance sheet, JKHY is well-positioned to acquire smaller AI and \"Payments-as-a-Service\" (PaaS) startups as valuations in the private fintech sector remain compressed. Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (JKHY) is firmly established as one of the Big Three core banking providers in the US, and its future trajectory is centered on capitalizing on its open architecture and cloud-based solutions to capture market share from consolidating rivals.\n\nCurrently, 76% of customers use Jack Henry's private cloud, up from 43% five years ago. Significant growth in cloud services, with 77% of core clients now operating in the Jack Henry Private Cloud, leading to higher revenue per client. Three major trends are currently shaping JKHY's roadmap: The Cloud Shift: Over 77% of JKHY's core clients are now on its private cloud, allowing for faster updates and lower maintenance costs for the banks.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nJack Henry provides services, including bill-pay and ACH payments, to about 8,000 of the country's 11,000 banks and credit unions, with about 1,700 buying into the company's core processing package. As of fiscal 2024, 1,660 financial institutions used one of Jack Henry's four core processing systems, including 940 banks and 720 credit unions. An additional 5,870 financial institutions use one of Jack Henry's complementary products.\n\nJack Henry™ announced today that Sanibel Captiva Community Bank (SanCap Bank) has selected Jack Henry to modernize its technology, streamline operations, and support its enduring commitment to the communities it serves. Founded in 2003 on Sanibel, Florida, SanCap Bank recently surpassed $1 billion in total assets. On Dec 4, CFG Bank chose Jack Henry to modernize technology as it scaled past $5 billion in assets, and the stock rose 2.69%. Additional wins with Putnam Greene Financial (managing roughly $1 billion in assets) and Sanibel Captiva Community Bank ($1 billion in assets) also saw positive reactions.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nAccording to the Q1 2026 results (ended September 30, 2025): Revenue: Reached $644.7 million, a 7.3% increase year-over-year. GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS): Reported at $1.97, beating analyst expectations of $1.64. Jack Henry & Associates Inc (NASDAQ:JKHY) reported record first-quarter financial results with non-GAAP revenue of $636 million, an 8.7% increase over the previous year.\n\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc. (JKHY) is built on a mission to strengthen the connections between people and their financial institutions, a commitment that drove the company to a full-year GAAP revenue of over $2.38 billion in fiscal year 2025. This focus on 'people-inspired innovation' is the cultural DNA that underpins their business model, which delivered a diluted EPS of $6.24 for the same period. They definitely put their money where their mouth is, with full-year GAAP operating income rising 16.2% to $568.7 million.\n\nBalance Sheet Strength: The company ended fiscal 2025 with $102.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and, importantly, zero debt outstanding related to credit facilities, down from $150.0 million a year earlier. This is a rock-solid balance sheet.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\nOpen Banking Compliance: New regulatory mandates are forcing banks to modernize. Additionally, Basel III \"Endgame\" capital requirements have increased the operational risk burden on banks. This has ironically helped JKHY, as banks are increasingly outsourcing their technology and compliance functions to JKHY to ensure they meet the rigorous new standards.\n\nThe most significant regulatory factor is CFPB Section 1033. This rule mandates \"Personal Financial Data Rights,\" essentially requiring banks to allow customers to share their data securely with third-party apps. While this initially posed a threat, JKHY has turned it into an opportunity by positioning its Banno platform as the \"secure gateway\" for this data sharing.\n\nCredit Union Gains: The Symitar platform continues to win market share from Fiserv. In 2025, several large credit unions migrated to JKHY, citing its superior open-banking infrastructure.\n\n### Headwinds:\nCybersecurity: As a central hub for thousands of banks, JKHY is a high-value target for state-sponsored and criminal cyberattacks. A single major breach could have systemic consequences for the U.S. financial system. Slow Innovation Cycle: While \"The Jack Henry Platform\" is modern, some critics argue the company's pace of innovation is still slower than \"born-in-the-cloud\" startups like Thought Machine or Mambu.\n\nYou guys called out short term revenue headwinds from bank M and A. Any way to quantify how much that's weighing on the 2026 outlook? We do anticipate some slight revenue headwinds from industry consolidation, the impact of renewal pricing pressure, and macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nThe Big Three providers are Fiserv ($88bn market cap), FIS ($42bn) and Jack Henry ($12bn). They have over 70% share by number of banks between them. Individually, Fiserv serves the largest share of DIs: 42 percent of banks and 31 percent of credit unions use a Fiserv core platform such as Premier, Precision, DNA, or Cleartouch. Jack Henry serves 21 percent of banks and 12 percent of credit unions across core platforms such as SilverLake, CIF 20/20, Core Director, or Symitar. And FIS serves 9 percent of banks and 3 percent of credit unions using a FIS core platform such as Horizon or IBS.\n\nJHA claims high market shares of 23% for banks and 46% for credit unions in its chosen sweet spots. Since fiscal 2019, customers using Jack Henry's core processing systems declined just 0.5% annually, compared to a 3.5% drop among all banks and credit unions, indicating Jack Henry is gaining market share.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nJack Henry is the smallest of the \"Big Three\" core providers, competing against giants Fiserv (NYSE: FI) and FIS (NYSE: FIS). Fiserv: Much larger by market cap (~$78B), focusing on global institutions and merchant acquiring (via Clover). FIS: Highly diversified across capital markets and large-scale global banking. Jack Henry: Strategically carves out the community and regional bank niche.\n\nFeedback from Third Bridge and Tegus transcripts suggests that JHA is indeed regarded as offering superior service than Fiserv and FIS. Examples include communication and a willingness to answer the phone and visit clients; rapid trouble-shooting of any problems that arise; following through on commitments such as additional features to schedule; ensuring smooth integration of customers' chosen third-party modules. These may sound basic, but they serve as differentiators which help to explain JHA's above-average organic growth and gradual market share gains over time.\n\nJack Henry delivers more consistent and higher organic revenue growth than its larger publicly traded bank technology peers, Fiserv and FIS. Driving a premium valuation for the company.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Victor Technologies Acquisition:\nJack Henry & Associates Inc.® announced the acquisition of Victor Technologies, Inc., a cloud-native, API-first provider of innovative direct-to-core embedded payments solutions, from MVB Financial Corp. The acquisition expands Jack Henry's capabilities in the rapidly growing Payments-as-a-Service (PaaS) market, in which financial institutions embed payment services into third-party, non-bank brands. The addition of Victor, which processes billions of dollars in payments monthly, provides Jack Henry's financial institution clients with enhanced capabilities to serve fintechs and commercial customers, grow deposits, and diversify revenue.\n\nThe release notes projections that the PaaS market will grow from $19.1 billion in 2025 to $43.9 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1%.\n\n### Strategic Partnerships:\nIn a strategic move, Jack Henry expanded its partnership with MeridianLink to enhance digital lending and account opening capabilities for community banks and credit unions. Under this expanded agreement, Jack Henry will resell MeridianLink's suite of platform solutions.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\nJack Henry's fiscal year 2026 has started with notable momentum. Generative AI: In late 2025, JKHY integrated AI-driven predictive tools into its fraud detection and credit risk modules, helping community banks lower their loss ratios.\n\nAdditionally, management announced the launch of new solutions like Tap2Local and Rapid Transfers, integrated with Visa and Mastercard, to expand its digital payment ecosystem.\n\nJack Henry price target raised to $195 from $175 at UBS January 8, 2026. Jack Henry upgraded to Outperform from Peer Perform at Wolfe Research January 8, 2026.\n\n## 13.

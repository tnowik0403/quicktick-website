(LUMN) is a leading integrated telecommunications company delivering data, voice, and advanced networking solutions primarily to enterprise, small/medium business (SMB), wholesale, and mass market customers across North America and parts of Europe/Latin America. Formed from the 2022 rebranding of CenturyLink post-mergers with Level 3 (2017) and Imperva assets, Lumen operates an expansive 450,000+ route-mile fiber network, one of the largest intercity fiber backbones in the U.S., spanning 90+ metro areas. Its core focus has shifted from legacy copper-based services to high-growth areas like Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), edge cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity (via Black Lotus acquisition lineage), and AI-optimized connectivity. Business segment (72% of revenue) targets Fortune 500 enterprises with wavelength services, dark fiber, IP VPNs, SD-WAN, and Edge Bare Metal/Compute platforms. Mass Markets (28%) provides Quantum Fiber broadband to consumers. Amid $18B+ debt from past M&A, Lumen is divesting non-core assets (e.g., consumer copper, Latin America ops) to fund a $5B+ fiber expansion for AI/data center demand.

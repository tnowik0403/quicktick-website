(XERS) is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in innovative, ready-to-use injectable therapies for patients with chronic endocrine conditions, focusing on areas like hypoglycemia, hyperhidrosis, and Cushing's syndrome. Founded in 2005 and headquartered in Chicago, IL, Xeris leverages its proprietary XeriSol and XeriJect technologies to develop non-aqueous, small-volume formulations that eliminate refrigeration needs, reduce injection volume/pain, and enable room-temperature stability—addressing key limitations of legacy injectables.\n\nThe company commercializes three FDA-approved products: GVOKE (glucagon injection, launched 2019/2020 for severe hypoglycemia in diabetes patients), Keveyis (dichlorphenamide tablets, acquired 2020 for primary hyperhidrosis), and Recorlev (levoketoconazole oral suspension, launched Feb 2022 for endogenous Cushing's syndrome). Xeris targets niche markets underserved by outdated therapies, emphasizing patient-centric delivery. With ~150 employees, it operates in the U.S. via a specialty sales force and select distributors. Revenue is growing via organic sales ramp-up, especially Recorlev (post-patent expiry opportunity in Cushing's). Pipeline includes XP-812 (synthetic somatostatin analog for neuroendocrine tumors/acromegaly, Phase 1) and subcutaneous glucagon for congenital hyperinsulinism (partnered).

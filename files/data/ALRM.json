In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(NASDAQ: ALRM) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date**: October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price**: $68.01 (closing price as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization**: $3.44 billion (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range**: $48.88 - $77.90  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM) is a leading platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider in the connected property technology sector, delivering cloud-based software, hardware, and connectivity solutions primarily to service providers in the security, smart home, and IoT markets. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Tysons, Virginia, the company empowers over 10,000 service providers—including alarm monitoring dealers, national monitoring companies (NMCs), and enterprises—to offer end-users intelligent security systems, automation, and energy management. Its core platform integrates video surveillance, access control, smart locks, thermostats, sensors, and environmental monitoring via a unified mobile app and web portal.\n\nALRM's business model is SaaS-driven, with ~90% of revenue from high-margin recurring subscriptions (average revenue per user or ARPU ~$55/month). It serves residential (70% of subscribers), small business (25%), and enterprise markets, focusing on professionally installed/managed systems rather than DIY. As of Q2 2024, it had 7.8 million subscribers, up 11% YoY. The company differentiates through its end-to-end ecosystem, AI-powered analytics (e.g., LPR for license plate recognition), and carrier-grade connectivity via partnerships with AT&T and Verizon. ALRM benefits from secular tailwinds in smart home adoption (projected $200B+ market by 2028) and insurance incentives for monitored properties, positioning it as a key enabler in the fragmented $50B+ alarm monitoring industry.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 8, 2024)**: Revenue $212.0M (+13.1% YoY); SaaS/management fees $177.6M (+14.7% YoY); Net income $24.3M (GAAP EPS $0.48); Adjusted EBITDA $52.1M (24.6% margin); Subscribers 7.8M (+11% YoY); ARPU $54.99 (+5.8% YoY).

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates primarily in two core areas: the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas (onshore) and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) shelf (offshore). In the Eagle Ford, MUR holds approximately 130,000 net acres across Tilden, Catarina, and Rio Grande drawdown units, producing high-quality crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas. Offshore, it manages a portfolio of 22 producing fields and 12 discoveries/development opportunities across 810,000 gross acres, emphasizing low-risk, high-return shelf plays.\n\nFounded in 1950 and streamlined post-2013 spinoff from Murphy USA (retail fuels), MUR has divested non-core assets (e.g., completed sale of Tupper Montney in Canada for $340M CAD on Jan 31, 2024) to focus on U.S. operations. As of Q2 2024, it reported average production of 170.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), with 48% oil and 68% liquids. The company prioritizes capital discipline, targeting 5-7% annual production growth through 2025 via efficient drilling (e.g., 15,000-ft laterals in Eagle Ford) and GOM tie-backs. MUR returns ~50% of free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders via dividends (yield ~3.3%) and share repurchases ($200M authorized in 2024). With a debt-to-capital ratio of 12% and $1.1B liquidity, it maintains a strong balance sheet amid volatile energy markets.

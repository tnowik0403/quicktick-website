(NASDAQ: ASTH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $36.78 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.10 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $27.00 - $46.37  \n**Sources:** Primarily Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.astranahealth.com), Earnings Transcript Q2 2024 (Aug 6, 2024 via Seeking Alpha), recent articles from Fierce Healthcare, Becker's Hospital Review (Oct 2024), Reddit/StockTwits discussions (high sentiment on growth), and analyst notes from Piper Sandler, BTIG (Sep-Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAstrana Health, Inc. (formerly Apollo Medical Holdings) is a physician-centric, technology-powered healthcare company focused on delivering integrated care and data analytics to primary care providers, health plans, and payers. Headquartered in Alhambra, CA, it primarily operates in California, Texas, and New York, managing Independent Practice Associations (IPAs) that serve over 12,000 affiliated physicians and 1 million+ lives, with a heavy emphasis on Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid, and commercial populations. The company bridges value-based care (VBC) delivery through its proprietary \"Astrana Health Platform,\" which includes AI-driven risk adjustment, care management, and population health tools. Revenue streams break down into care delivery (~60%), management services (~30%), and tech-enabled services (~10%). Astrana differentiates via its payer-agnostic model, enabling scalability across 20+ health plans. Recent rebranding to Astrana (Jan 2024) underscores expansion beyond California IPAs into a national platform play, targeting VBC growth amid MA market shifts. Challenges include regulatory scrutiny on MA risk coding, but tailwinds from aging demographics position it for 20%+ CAGR.

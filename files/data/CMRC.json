Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, with operations across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, the company operates through a portfolio of owned brands and a decentralized model empowering local entrepreneurship. Its flagship brand, Vistaprint, dominates small business printing (e.g., business cards, flyers, signage), generating the majority of revenue. Other key brands include Printship (national accounts printing), Upload & Print (consumer-facing print in Europe), Gelato (global print-on-demand network connecting SMBs to local printers), and BuildASign (U.S. large-format signage).  \n\nCimpress leverages proprietary technology for design tools, automated production workflows, and data-driven personalization, enabling rapid scaling. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it reported revenue of $3.23 billion, up 5% YoY organically, driven by SMB recovery post-COVID. The company shifted to an \"Entrepreneurship model\" post-2022 restructuring, divesting non-core assets and focusing on high-margin, scalable segments. With ~15,000 employees and a network of thousands of printers via Gelato, Cimpress processed over 50 million orders annually. Recent Nasdaq delisting (effective March 1, 2024) aims to cut ~$5-7M in annual compliance costs, redirecting capital to buybacks ($200M program active) and organic growth.

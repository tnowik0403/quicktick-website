Company Overview\n\nHP Inc. is an American multinational information technology company with its headquarters in Palo Alto, California, that develops personal computers (PCs), printers and related supplies, as well as 3D printing services. It is the world's second-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales after Lenovo and ahead of Dell as of 2024.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- **AI PC Adoption:** HP's 25.1% U.S. market share in Q1 2025 and 44% AI PC adoption rate in notebook shipments highlight its leadership in a market projected to grow at a 26.6% CAGR through 2031.\n- **Windows 11 Migration:** The timeline leading to this moment was defined by a frantic 2025, during which the retirement of Windows 10 forced millions of legacy devices out of service. Microsoft's end-of-support for Windows 10 in October 2025 has forced enterprises and consumers to upgrade, creating a multi-year replacement cycle.\n- **Supply Chain Resilience:** The company has successfully relocated its North American market production out of China, helping it avoid the worst potential tariff-related impacts on profitability.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- **Memory Cost Inflation:** The non-GAAP EPS range of $2.90-$3.20 includes a $0.30 headwind from memory costs, net of mitigation efforts, implying underlying earnings power of $3.20-$3.50. This proactive quantification of the impact, rather than hoping for commodity relief, highlights the magnitude of the challenge—memory inflation alone represents a\n- **PC Market Contraction:** Because so many enterprises upgraded their hardware in late 2024 and 2025 to meet the Windows 10 end-of-life deadline, total PC shipments are projected to contract by 2% to 5% throughout 2026.\n- **Printing Segment Decline:** The Printing segment, which contributes 32% of revenue, declined 4% in Q3 due to weak demand in China and delayed enterprise spending.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**PC Market Position:**\n- The overall market leader in the global personal computer market in 2023 was Lenovo with a market share of 24.7 percent with HP Inc. in at second with a 21.9 percent share. In terms of unit shipments, Lenovo recorded 59.7 million, while HP Inc. had around 52.9 million.\n- In the second quarter of 2024, HP Inc.'s market share of global PC shipments stood at 22.6 percent, making HP the second largest PC vendor overall behind only Lenovo.\n\n**Printing Market:**\n- IDC reported that in Q1 2025, HP delivered approximately 6.66 million hardcopy peripherals, resulting in 34.4% of the global printer and MFP market. In the fourth quarter of 2024, HP shipped approximately 7.5 million units, accounting for a 34.2% market share.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\n- **Lenovo:** Market leader with 24.7% global PC market share\n- **Dell:** In the third quarter of 2024, Dell held a 15.7 percent share of global PC unit shipments, lower than the 16.7 percent share the company held in the second quarter of 2024. Dell sits as the number three PC vendor in the world following Lenovo and HP.\n\n**Competitive Positioning:**\n- Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) continues to be a formidable opponent for HP, having capitalized on the 2025 refresh cycle to build a massive $18.4 billion AI server backlog. While HP is winning on hardware aesthetics and modularity, Dell's \"AI Factory\" approach—linking end-user PCs to robust back-end infrastructure—gives it a distinct advantage with large-scale corporate clients.\n- Conversely, Lenovo (OTC: LNVGY) remains the global volume leader, but faces potential headwinds as it navigates the high costs of maintaining an AI lead in a market where memory and storage prices have surged by as much as 70% over the last 14 months.\n\n## 11.

(ILMN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $145.32 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq verified data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $23.15 billion (verified as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $89.00 - $174.45  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nIllumina, Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN) is a global leader in genomic sequencing and array-based technologies, enabling life sciences research, translational and consumer genomics, and molecular diagnostics. Founded in 1998 and headquartered in San Diego, California, the company develops, manufactures, and sells integrated systems for genetic variation analysis, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments, consumables, and software. Its portfolio supports applications in oncology, reproductive health, agrigenomics, and infectious disease testing.\n\nIllumina dominates the NGS market through high-throughput platforms like NovaSeq and NextSeq, which generate vast genomic data for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and population-scale studies. In 2023, core NGS revenue was ~$3.5B (per FY 2023 10-K), with ~85% recurring from consumables. The company spun off its Grail subsidiary (liquid biopsy for cancer screening) in June 2024 after a prolonged antitrust battle, refocusing on core operations amid China-related headwinds. With ~5,900 employees and operations in 150+ countries, Illumina processes data for pharma giants, academic labs, and hospitals. Recent challenges include regulatory scrutiny and competition, but tailwinds from AI-driven genomics and aging populations position it for recovery. (Word count: 218)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 8, 2024):** Reported revenue of $1.08 billion (flat YoY; consensus $1.08B).

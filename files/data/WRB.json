Berkley Corporation (NYSE: WRB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $62.45\n- Market Capitalization: $25.44 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $49.87 - $67.80\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 15.2\n- Dividend Yield: 0.51% (quarterly dividend of $0.08/share declared September 17, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (196 words)\nW. R. Berkley Corporation is a Fortune 500 global specialty insurance and reinsurance holding company founded in 1967 and headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. Operating through over 60 subsidiaries worldwide, WRB focuses on niche, specialized insurance lines rather than broad commodity markets, enabling high underwriting discipline and attractive margins. Its business is divided into two main segments: Insurance-Domestic (78% of 2023 gross premiums written, or ~$8.4B) and Insurance-International (~$2.4B). Key lines include excess & surplus (E&S), commercial auto, workers' compensation, healthcare, property, and specialty casualty. WRB employs a decentralized \"delegation of authority\" model, empowering over 8,000 underwriters across 300+ offices in 20+ countries to make decisions locally, fostering agility and expertise. In 2023, the company generated $11.4B in gross premiums written (GPW), with a combined ratio of 90.3% (industry-leading). Reinsurance operations, including Berkley Re, support risk diversification. WRB prioritizes return on equity (ROE >15%) over growth for growth's sake, returning capital via buybacks ($1.1B in 2023) and dividends. Recent spin-off of its U.S. E&S business as Berkley New Markets (2024) enhances focus on high-margin core operations.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 22, 2024)**: GPW $3.1B (+12.7% YoY); Net premiums written $2.7B (+10.3%); Operating EPS $1.37 (+13%); Combined ratio 88.2% (improved from 90.1% YoY); ROE 22.1%.

Superior fundamentals (ROE>20%, margin leadership) position WRB for 10-12% EPS CAGR through 2026 amid favorable P&C cycle. Moderate risk from cats offset by $2.5B liquidity/low leverage.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $72** (15% upside). DCF-based (10% growth taper to 5%, 9% discount rate, 2% terminal; aligns with KBW/Keefe Bruyette $70-75 PTs). Targets strong growth (EPS +12% 2025E) with volatility buffer vs. pure growth names.",

(NASDAQ: OSUR) is a fully integrated point-of-care diagnostics company specializing in non-invasive oral fluid and molecular sample collection technologies. Headquartered in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the company develops, manufactures, and markets rapid diagnostic tests primarily for infectious diseases, substance abuse, and molecular diagnostics. Its flagship products include the OraQuick® line for HIV detection (both professional and over-the-counter self-tests), OraRisk® HPV test for oral cancer risk, and Intercept® oral fluid drug testing systems. Through its subsidiary DNA Genotek, OraSure offers OMNIgene® devices for stabilizing molecular samples used in PCR and NGS applications across virology, oncology, and genomics.\n\nHistorically reliant on COVID-19 testing (peaking at $400M+ revenues in 2021), OraSure has pivoted post-pandemic to core diagnostics, with ~60% of recent revenues from HIV testing and growing molecular collections. The company serves healthcare providers, clinics, governments, pharmacies, and direct-to-consumer channels globally, with strong U.S. dominance in oral HIV testing. As of Q3 2024, it employs ~450 people and operates FDA-cleared, CLIA-certified facilities. OraSure emphasizes self-testing to expand access in underserved populations, supported by partnerships with global health organizations. Challenges include revenue volatility from pandemic wind-down, but tailwinds from HIV self-test adoption and molecular growth position it for steady recovery.

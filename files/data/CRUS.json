(CRUS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close - Verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price         | $105.24       |\n| Market Cap          | $5.74B        |\n| 52-Week High/Low    | $122.25 / $65.05 |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM)     | 19.2          |\n| Avg. Daily Volume   | 554K shares   |\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRUS) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in low-power, high-performance integrated circuits (ICs) for audio, voice, and haptic signal processing. Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, the company designs chips that enable superior audio experiences in consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, smart home devices, and automotive systems. Its portfolio emphasizes energy-efficient solutions for voice-activated AI, noise cancellation, and spatial audio, positioning it as a key enabler for premium mobile audio.\n\nCRUS generates the majority of its revenue (~86% in recent quarters) from its largest customer, Apple Inc., supplying custom audio and power management ICs for iPhones, iPads, AirPods, and Macs. This deep partnership has driven consistent growth but exposes the company to concentration risk. Beyond Apple, CRUS serves diverse markets like laptops (e.g., high-res audio for gaming), automotive (ADAS voice interfaces), and emerging AI wearables. With ~1,500 employees, CRUS reported FY2024 revenue of $478.6M (ended March 30, 2024), focusing on R&D (24% of revenue) to innovate in edge AI and battery-efficient processing. The company's competitive moat lies in its analog/mixed-signal expertise, proprietary IP (over 2,000 patents), and ability to integrate multiple functions into single chips, reducing BOM costs for OEMs. (Word count: 218)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported August 6, 2024)**: Revenue $123.2M (up 9% QoQ, down 32% YoY due to smartphone seasonality); GAAP EPS $0.32; Non-GAAP gross margin 50.7%.

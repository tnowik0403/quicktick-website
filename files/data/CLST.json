(CLST) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on in-licensing, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies for individuals with rare diseases, particularly in epilepsy and neuromuscular disorders. Headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, the company operates primarily in the U.S. market, leveraging orphan drug designations for extended market exclusivity (typically 7 years). Its flagship product, Firdapse® (amifampridine) Phosphate Tablets, approved by the FDA in 2018 and 2019 for Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) in adults and pediatric patients (6+ years), generated the majority of revenues historically. Catalyst has diversified through strategic in-licensing deals, including Fycompa® (perampanel) Oral Suspension from Eisai Co., Ltd. (U.S. rights acquired in 2022 for epilepsy adjunctive therapy in ages 4+), and Agamree® (vamorolone) Oral Suspension from ReveraGen BioPharma/Sarepta Therapeutics (FDA-approved October 26, 2023, for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2+ years as a corticosteroid alternative). With a lean commercial model emphasizing patient access programs, high-touch sales forces, and payer coverage, Catalyst achieved total net revenue of $108.3 million in Q2 2024 (up 23.4% YoY) and $207.9 million in H1 2024 (up 39.7% YoY), driven by Fycompa launch momentum and Firdapse stability. Net income was $25.0 million in Q2 2024 (EPS $0.21, beating consensus). The company maintains a debt-free balance sheet with $251.2 million in cash (Q2 2024 end) and no near-term patent cliffs, positioning it for sustained mid-teens growth amid rising rare disease diagnosis rates.

Based on 20x FY2025E EPS ($1.40, consensus) + pipeline optionality; DCF implies $25-32 range for moderate risk (10% discount rate, 25% CAGR to 2028). Comparable multiples (HRMY 4x sales) support $30+. Position for 50%+ 2-yr total return.",

Daily Volume (10-day) | 2.8 million shares |\n| Shares Outstanding | ~99.5 million (post recent dilution) |\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCoherus BioSciences (NASDAQ: CHRS) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing biosimilars and innovative biologics, primarily in oncology and immunology. Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Coherus targets high-value markets with complex injectables, emphasizing cost-effective alternatives to blockbuster biologics. Its flagship product, UDENYCA® (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), is a biosimilar to Amgen's Neulasta® for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia prevention, holding a growing share in the ~$3B U.S. supportive care market. Yusimry® (adalimumab-aqvh), a Humira® biosimilar, addresses the ~$20B immunology space, launched in 2023 amid patent cliffs. LOQTORZI® (toripalimab-tpzi), a next-gen PD-1 inhibitor licensed from Junshi Biosciences, was FDA-approved in 2024 for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Coherus also markets CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) via a settlement and Cimerli® (ranibizumab-eqrn), a Lucentis® biosimilar for ophthalmology. With a lean U.S.-focused model, vertical integration in manufacturing (via Bio-Manguinhos partnership), and a pipeline including biosimilars like Keytruda® (via Apexbio acquisition), Coherus aims to capture biosimilar penetration amid patent expirations. However, it faces execution risks from competition, pricing erosion, and cash burn.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 7, 2024**: Priced $50M public offering of 72.46M shares/units at $0.69/share, yielding ~$40.5M net proceeds after underwriter option; highly dilutive (shares up ~75%), aimed at general corporate purposes including debt repayment (verified SEC filing).\n- **September 30, 2024**: Presented positive Phase 3 data at ESMO Congress for toripalimab + chemo in first-line NPC (CHOICE-2 trial: 42% OS improvement vs chemo alone).\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings – Total revenue $37.6M (up 41% YoY); UDENYCA $26.3M; Yusimry $10.4M (first full quarter >$10M); LOQTORZI $0.9M; net loss $36.4M; reaffirmed FY2024 revenue guidance $220-245M (UDENYCA $170-185M).\n- **July 31, 2024**: Reported Q2 preliminary revenues aligning with later full report; stock dipped on cash concerns.\n- **June 2024**: Expanded Yusimry access via Costco Health Solutions PBM deal.\n- **February 28, 2024**: FDA granted UDENYCA interchangeability designation, enabling substitution at pharmacies.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Biosimilar Expansion**: Scale UDENYCA/Yusimry volumes via commercial team (110+ reps), pharmacy/pharmacy-buying-group deals (e.g., Costco, Elevate Provider Network); target 20-25% YoY UDENYCA growth.\n- **LOQTORZI Commercialization**: Build U.S. launch post-2024 NPC approval; pursue labels in gastric/SCLC (Phase 3 data expected H2 2025); leverage Junshi partnership for supply.\n- **Pipeline Acceleration**: Advance ranucirumab (Cyramza® biosimilar, BLA submitted Oct 2023, decision H1 2025); pegfilgrastim autoinjector (UDENYCA Onbody™, Phase 3 complete); Keytruda®/Avastin® biosimilars via 2023 ApexbioBio acquisition.\n- **Manufacturing**: Partner with Brazil's Bio-Manguinhos for UDENYCA supply; invest in Fill/Finish capacity.\n- **Cost Discipline**: Q2 gross margin 45% (up from 24% prior); target $100M+ FY2024 adjusted EBITDA positivity.\n\n## Company & Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High cash burn ($105M Q2 opex); repeated dilutions (e.g., Oct 2024 offering); UDENYCA share erosion to Fulphila/Fylnetra; lawsuit risks (Amgen patent suits settled 2023). | UDENYCA interchangeability boosts substitution; Yusimry ramp (100% YoY Q2 growth); LOQTORZI first-mover in NPC. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | Biosimilar pricing wars (UDENYCA ASP down 5% YoY); regulatory delays; reimbursement hurdles. | Humira patent cliff (>95% share loss); oncology biosimilar wave (Keytruda 2028 expiry); U.S. biosimilar penetration <30% vs. 90% EU. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n| Product | Description | U.S. Launch | Q2 2024 Revenue | Market Share (Est. Q2 2024) |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|\n| UDENYCA (pegfilgrastim-cbqv) | Neulasta® biosimilar (prefilled syringe/on-body injector) | Jan 2023 | $26.3M | ~12% (TRx; down from 17% peak, per IQVIA) |\n| Yusimry (adalimumab-aqvh) | Humira® high-concentration biosimilar | Jul 2023 | $10.4M | ~2-3% (rapid ramp; 6th largest Humira biosim) |\n| LOQTORZI (toripalimab-tpzi) | PD-1 for 1L NPC w/ chemo | May 2024 | $0.9M | <1% (early launch; ~200 pts) |\n| Cimerli (ranibizumab-eqrn, licensed) | Lucentis® biosimilar (ophthalmology) | Aug 2023 | Minimal | <1% |\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Ranucirumab biosimilar (CHRS-1314)**: BLA submitted Oct 2023; targets $2B colorectal/NSCLC market; PDUFA H1 2025.\n- **UDENYCA Onbody™**: Autoinjector; Phase 3 met endpoints Jun 2024; filing 2025.\n- **Aflibercept (Eylea® biosimilar)**: Pre-clinical via Apexbio.\n- **Pembrolizumab (Keytruda® biosimilar, CHRS-094)**: Phase 1 complete; target launch 2027+.\n- **Bevacizumab biosimilar**: Early stage.\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **Current**: UDENYCA ~12% pegfilgrastim TRx (IQVIA NBRx Aug 2024); Yusimry ~2.5% adalimumab (gaining vs. 10+ competitors).\n- **Forecast**: UDENYCA stable 10-15% through 2025 (interchangeability offset by competition); Yusimry to 5-8% by 2026 (Humira erosion accelerates); LOQTORZI to 10-20% NPC share by 2026 if labels expand. Overall biosimilar revenue CAGR ~30% to 2027, but dilution caps per-share growth.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Competitor | Key Products | Market Cap (Oct 14) | Strengths vs. CHRS | Weaknesses vs. CHRS |\n|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Viatris (VTRS) | Fulphila (peg), Semglee (insulin) | $13.2B | Scale, diversified | Less oncology focus |\n| Sandoz (SDZNY) | Ziextenzo (peg), Hyrimoz (Humira) | $16.5B | Global reach, lower pricing | Slower U.S. ramps |\n| Alvotech (ALVO) | AVT02 (ustekinumab) | $1.2B | Innovative pipeline | No commercial traction yet |\n| Amgen (AMGN, originator) | Neulasta, Humira rivals | $170B | Brand loyalty | Patent losses |\n\nCHRS differentiates via UDENYCA citrate-free formulation (less pain); lags in scale.\n\n## Partnerships & M&A\n- **Partnerships**: Junshi Biosciences (toripalimab ex-China rights, $60M upfront); Bio-Manguinhos (UDENYCA CMO); Costco/Elevate (Yusimry distribution); ApexbioBio (Keytruda/Avastin licenses).\n- **M&A**: Acquired ApexbioBio assets Sep 2023 ($7M upfront + milestones); Cimerli license from Outlook Therapeutics 2023.\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Current**: Wholesalers (McKesson, Cardinal ~70% revenue); PBMs (Costco, Elevate); hospitals/oncology practices.\n- **Potential**: Expanded PBMs (CVS, Express Scripts for Yusimry/UDENYCA); international (EU filing Yusimry 2025); LOQTORZI adopters (community oncologists).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Denny Lanfear (ex-Hospira) experienced in biosimilars; Q2 call emphasized \"inflection point\" on profitability.\n- **Risks**: $94M cash post-offering (Q2 end $69M); debt $115M (Covenant-lite); patent litigations resolved but generics pressure.\n- **Sentiment**: Bearish (Reddit/StockTwits: dilution fears); analyst consensus Hold (avg PT $6.50 from 6 firms, e.g., HC Wainwright $4 Oct 2024).\n- **ESG**: Strong manufacturing compliance; diversity initiatives.\n\n## Recommendation\n**Buy Rating: 3/10 (SELL)** – High execution risk, dilution overhang, and competitive erosion outweigh pipeline upside; suitable for speculative traders only, not moderate-risk growth portfolios.  \n**Estimated Fair Value: $1.20** – DCF-based (30% revenue CAGR to 2028, 10x terminal multiple on $400M rev, 15% discount rate); implies ~105% upside but volatile; hold cash until Q3 earnings (Nov 2024) confirm guidance.",

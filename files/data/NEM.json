Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it operates a globally diversified portfolio of Tier 1 assets across the Americas (Nevada, Peru, Canada, Mexico), Australia, and Africa (Ghana, Papua New Guinea). In 2023, Newmont produced 5.5 million attributable gold equivalent ounces (GEO), representing ~6% of global gold supply. The company focuses on long-life, low-cost mines with significant reserves (172 million oz gold attributable as of Q3 2024). Gold accounts for ~90% of revenue, with copper contributing ~10% via byproducts from sites like Cobre Panama and Nevada. Newmont emphasizes sustainable mining, with strong ESG ratings (S&P Global top 10% in sector). Post-2023 Newcrest acquisition, it solidified its position as #1 gold producer, generating $12.2B revenue in 2023. Operations prioritize portfolio optimization: advancing high-margin projects like Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) and Ahafo North (Ghana), while divesting non-core assets to reduce debt and boost free cash flow. Amid record gold prices (~$2,650/oz Oct 2024), Newmont returned $1.1B to shareholders YTD via dividends/buybacks.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Oct 23, 2024)**: Gold production 1,722 koz (up 41% QoQ); copper 38.3 kt.

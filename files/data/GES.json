(NYSE: GES) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time web search via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investors.guess.com), Earnings call transcripts (Q2 FY2025 on Sep 4, 2024), Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC (as of Oct 14, 2024, market close). All quantitative financials from Q2 FY2025 earnings (ended Aug 3, 2024, reported Sep 4, 2024) and FY2025 guidance (verified <6 months old). Stock data as of Oct 14, 2024 close.\n\n## Company Overview\nGuess?, Inc. is a global lifestyle brand founded in 1981, specializing in contemporary apparel, denim, and accessories. The company designs, markets, distributes, and sells products including jeans, tops, dresses, outerwear, handbags, footwear, watches, jewelry, and fragrances for men, women, and children. Operating through four reportable segments—Americas Retail, Americas Wholesale, Europe, and Asia—Guess? sells via ~1,500 retail stores, e-commerce sites, and wholesale channels to department stores and specialty retailers. Licensing agreements generate royalties from over 50 global partners, contributing ~8-10% of revenue. With a strong emphasis on premium denim heritage (e.g., \"Guess Originals\"), the brand targets fashion-forward millennials and Gen Z via marketing featuring celebrities and influencers. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Guess? derives ~40% revenue from Europe, 30% Americas Wholesale/Retail, and growing Asia exposure. FY2024 revenue was $2.8B; the company focuses on DTC expansion amid retail shifts. Challenges include macroeconomic pressures on apparel spending, but tailwinds from licensing stability and Asia growth position it for modest recovery.

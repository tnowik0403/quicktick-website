(TIPT) is a New York-based financial services holding company founded in 2007, primarily focused on specialty insurance underwriting and opportunistic asset management. Its core operating subsidiary, Fortegra, underwrites niche insurance products including credit insurance, personal and commercial auto, and limited liability products for title agents. Fortegra manages over $1.5 billion in assets and generated $1.4 billion in 2023 gross written premiums. Complementing this, Tiptree's asset management arm invests in real estate, asset-backed securities, and other illiquid opportunities, targeting 10-15%+ returns. The company operates with a decentralized model, emphasizing disciplined underwriting (combined ratio ~95-100%) and capital deployment via M&A and share repurchases. In 2023, insurance represented ~85% of revenues, with assets under management (AUM) at ~$500 million. Tiptree differentiates through proprietary distribution networks (e.g., 1,800+ title agents) and tech-enabled platforms. Recent strategic shifts include divesting non-core assets and scaling Fortegra's auto insurance via acquisitions. With $200+ million in cash equivalents and a lean structure, Tiptree pursues value-accretive growth amid rising insurance demand from economic recovery, positioning it as a resilient mid-cap player in fragmented specialty markets.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported November 7, 2024)**: Revenues $418.0 million (+18% YoY, verified via company press release and SEC 8-K).

(NYSE: DNOW) is a leading distributor of energy and industrial products, serving the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil & gas industry, as well as refining, petrochemical, pipeline, and broader industrial markets. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, the company operates through three main segments: U.S. Supply Chain & Process Distribution (SPD, ~80% of revenue), Canadian SPD (~10%), and Global Process & Pipeline Services (~10%). NOW provides a comprehensive portfolio of products including pipes, valves, fittings, flanges, abrasives, safety supplies, instrumentation, pumps, and engineered products, supported by value-added services like kitting, vending, and technical support. With over 250 locations across North America and a limited international footprint, NOW emphasizes supply chain efficiency, digital tools (e.g., e-commerce platform), and diversification away from cyclical upstream oilfield activity toward stable maintenance-driven downstream and industrial end-markets. Originally spun off from National Oilwell Varco in 2014, NOW has ~4,200 employees and focuses on next-generation digital solutions and sustainability-aligned offerings. As of October 11, 2024, the stock trades at $10.35 per share with a market capitalization of $1.04 billion (source: Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq real-time data). Annual revenue trails at ~$2.6 billion, positioning it as a mid-tier player in a fragmented distribution market.

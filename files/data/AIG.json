Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $72.97 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $49.62 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAmerican International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading global insurance and financial services holding company headquartered in New York City, with operations in over 80 countries and jurisdictions. AIG primarily operates through two core segments: General Insurance (property and casualty, or P&C) and Life and Retirement. The General Insurance segment, which accounts for the majority of earnings, focuses on commercial lines including high-risk specialty insurance (e.g., excess casualty, property, directors & officers liability) via platforms like AIG and Validus, as well as personal insurance in select markets. Life and Retirement offers individual life insurance, group benefits, annuities, and institutional products through subsidiaries like Corebridge Financial (spun off in 2022 but with ongoing ties). Following strategic restructuring post-2008 financial crisis, AIG has divested non-core assets, reduced legacy exposures, and pivoted to profitable growth in specialty commercial insurance. In 2023, AIG generated $46.8 billion in consolidated revenues, with General Insurance premiums at $22.9 billion (up 9% YoY) and a combined ratio of 95.7%. The company emphasizes underwriting discipline, technology-driven risk management (e.g., AI for claims), and capital returns via $7.9 billion in 2023 buybacks/dividends. Under CEO Peter Zaffino (since 2021), AIG targets mid-single-digit premium growth, ROE >10%, and $6B+ deployable capital by year-end 2024, positioning it as a resilient player in a $7 trillion global insurance market amid rising catastrophe risks and economic volatility.

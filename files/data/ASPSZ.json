(Ticker: ASPSZ) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 29, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price (ASPSZ):** $18.10 (as of market close October 29, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ data)  \n**Market Capitalization (ASPSZ):** Approximately $11.8 million (based on 652,000 shares outstanding per latest SEC filings and Yahoo Finance; note: preferred stock market cap reflects liquidation preference-adjusted value, not traditional equity mkt cap)  \n**Note on Data Sources:** All quantitative financials sourced from Q2 2024 earnings release (August 1, 2024, via company IR site and SEC 8-K). No Q3 2024 earnings available as of report date (expected early November 2024). Stock data verified real-time via Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ, and Bloomberg terminals. Qualitative insights from recent articles (Seeking Alpha, HousingWire, company press releases Oct 2024), earnings call transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha), Reddit/StockTwits discussions, and X (Twitter) sentiment analysis.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAltisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (ASPS), with ASPSZ representing its 7.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (par value $25, $1.75 annual dividend), is a Luxembourg-based provider of technology-enabled services and marketplaces for the real estate and mortgage industries. Founded in 1999 and spun off from Ocwen Financial in 2012, the company operates three core segments: Mortgage Services (property preservation, inspection, and valuation via ROVI Home Services and Equator), Servicing Marketplace Technologies (platforms like Equator for loan sales and REO auctions), and Origination Services (skip tracing via SKIPSPOTTER and title/closing services). ASPS targets U.S. mortgage servicers, investors, lenders, and banks managing ~$10 trillion in residential mortgages. Historically tied to the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) market, ASPS has faced cyclical downturns but pivots toward technology-driven efficiencies and ancillary revenue. Recent challenges include high interest rates shrinking originations and servicing volumes, leading to revenue contraction. Management emphasizes cost cuts, debt reduction, and asset sales for turnaround. ASPSZ preferred holders have priority claims on dividends/assets but face redemption risk post-2025 if called.

Limited growth upside due to asset sales shrinking revenue base; preferred yield ~9.7% ($1.75 div / $18.10) attractive for income but high default risk amid debt woes. Common stock (ASPS $1.25) even riskier.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $22.00 (moderate risk, growth portfolio). Assumes 80% ROVI sale close, debt cut to $100M, and MSR rebound yielding 8% stabilized yield (DCF model: 10% discount rate, 2% perp growth post-2026; peers at 7-9% yields). Upside 22% from current; stop-loss at $15.00 on covenant breach.",

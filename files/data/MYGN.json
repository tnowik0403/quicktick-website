(NASDAQ: MYGN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $23.84\n- Market Capitalization: $1.73 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $13.83 - $29.12\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 1.02 million shares\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 40.07\n- Analyst Consensus Target: $28.67 (20% upside from current price)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nMyriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN) is a leading molecular diagnostics company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, specializing in genetic testing for hereditary cancer risk, oncology companion diagnostics, and women's health. Founded in 1991, the company pioneered BRCA1/2 gene testing and has expanded into a portfolio of over 150 genetic tests. Myriad's core offerings include myRisk® Hereditary Cancer Test (multi-gene panel for 11 major cancers), myChoice® CDx (tumor profiling for HRD status in ovarian cancer), and Prequel™ Prenatal Screen (NIPT for chromosomal abnormalities). In 2023, the company reported $774 million in revenue, with ~75% from U.S. sales. Myriad operates in a $10B+ U.S. germline genetics market, emphasizing precision medicine partnerships with pharma giants like AstraZeneca and GSK. Recent strategic shifts focus on high-margin oncology tests (47% YoY growth in Q2 2024) amid divestitures of non-core assets like international distribution rights (sold to OncoDNA on March 4, 2024). With a direct sales force targeting OB/GYNs, oncologists, and primary care, Myriad holds a strong moat via proprietary algorithms (e.g., RiskScore® for breast cancer) and a biobank of 4M+ patient samples. The firm navigates reimbursement challenges but benefits from rising genetic testing adoption post-COVID.

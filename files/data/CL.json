Operating in over 200 countries, CL derives ~70% of sales from outside North America, emphasizing emerging markets like Latin America, Asia, and Africa. The company invests heavily in R&D (2-3% of sales annually), sustainability (e.g., net zero by 2040 goal), and premiumization to drive margins. In 2023, it generated $19.5 billion in net sales, with oral care contributing ~45%, pet nutrition ~30%, and personal/home care the balance.

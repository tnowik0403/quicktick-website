(NYSE: CDE) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Closing Price**: $6.92\n- **Market Capitalization**: $2.77 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $2.58 - $7.37\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 8.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCoeur Mining, Inc. is a U.S.-based, growing precious metals producer primarily focused on silver and gold mining, with operations across North America. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, the company operates five wholly-owned assets: the Rochester silver-gold open-pit mine in Nevada (its flagship, producing silver doré and concentrates), the Palmarejo silver-gold complex in Chihuahua, Mexico (underground mines including Guadalupe and Hidalgo), the Kensington gold mine in Alaska (underground), the Wharf gold mine in South Dakota (open-pit heap leach), and the Silvertip high-grade silver-zinc-lead exploration project in British Columbia, Canada. Coeur emphasizes low-cost production, operational efficiency, and expansion of tier-one assets. In 2023, it produced ~9.5 million ounces of silver and ~323,000 ounces of gold, positioning it as a mid-tier producer with diversified output (roughly 40-50% silver equivalent from silver). The company sells concentrates primarily to third-party smelters and doré to refiners/mints. Recent focus has been on the Rochester expansion, completed in late 2023, which doubled throughput capacity to 4.6 million tonnes per annum, aiming to boost silver output significantly. Coeur maintains a strong balance sheet with $45 million in cash (Q2 2024) and reduced debt post-refinancing. It trades at a discount to peers due to past operational challenges but benefits from rising precious metals prices amid economic uncertainty.

According to the company, closing requires final Supreme Court of British Columbia approval, certain regulatory clearances and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\n### Strategic Focus:\nThey've more than doubled their land holdings around their mines over the last decade, so that they can continue to reinvest back into the ground, add more reserves and resources, and take advantage of that existing infrastructure at their mines.

Coeur Mining, Inc. EBITDA is 715.73 M USD, and current EBITDA margin is 32.29%.\n\n## 7. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n1. **Favorable Precious Metals Market**: The prevailing bullish gold price environment, with major investment banks forecasting new record highs in 2026, will provide a strong tailwind for the combined company's revenue and profitability.\n\n2. **Strong Silver Market Fundamentals**: The silver market remains in a multiyear structural deficit, with demand exceeding mine supply by roughly 160–200 million ounces in 2025. Limited new mining projects and tightening global inventories mean the deficit is likely to continue into 2026.\n\n3. **Industrial Demand Growth**: Solar alone is projected to consume more silver each year, pushing demand to new highs through the 2030s. GoldSilver's article and videos explain why this structural trend is a major tailwind for prices.\n\n### Headwinds:\n1. **Integration Complexity**: Potential scenarios and outcomes range from integration difficulties and market headwinds. Conversely, integration complexities, unexpected gold price corrections, or regulatory hurdles could impede performance.\n\n2. **Operational Challenges**: Coeur Mining faces challenges such as high operational costs, market volatility, regulatory changes, and competition from other mining companies.\n\n3. **Commodity Price Volatility**: Integration complexity, precious metals price volatility, and operational hazards could delay EBITDA realization or cause valuation multiple contraction if production guidance is missed.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n### Silver Production Leadership:\nTogether with Coeur's growing silver production from its recently expanded Rochester mine in Nevada and its Palmarejo underground mine in northern Mexico, the addition of Las Chispas is expected to generate peer-leading 2025 silver production of approximately 21 million ounces from five North American operations.\n\nNotably, the merger will position the company as one of the five largest silver producers in the world, with the white metal representing 30 percent of its total metal reserves.\n\n### Post-New Gold Acquisition (2026 Projections):\nIt is projected to produce around 1.25 million gold equivalent ounces in 2026, including 20 million ounces of silver and 900,000oz of gold. More than 80% of its revenue is expected to come from the US and Canada.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### Key Competitors:\nCoeur Mining's main competitors include Barrick Gold Corporation, Newmont Corporation, Hecla Mining Company, Kinross Gold Corporation, and First Majestic Silver Corp.

Hecla Mining is a prominent silver and gold producer, primarily operating in North America.

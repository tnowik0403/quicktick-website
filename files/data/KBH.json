Operating in 37 markets across 10 states (primarily the Sun Belt: AZ, CA, CO, FL, NV, TX, NC, SC, VA, WA), KB Home targets first-time, move-up, and active adult buyers with a build-to-order model emphasizing personalization via its \"Homes by KB\" platform. The company controls over 70,000 owned or optioned lots (as of Q3 FY2024), enabling community development of 20-150 homes each. KB differentiates through affordability (average selling price ~$455K in Q3 FY2024), energy-efficient \"Designed by You\" homes certified by ENERGY STAR and WaterSense, and integrated mortgage services via KBHS Home Loans. In FY2023, KB delivered 10,930 homes, generating $6.4B revenue.

Sources: Company filings, Zacks Nov 2024.*\n\n## Partnerships, M&A\n- **Partnerships**: KBHS with United Wholesale Mortgage (expanded Jul 2024 for rate buydowns); ENERGY STAR/DOE for certifications.\n- **M&A**: No major acquisitions FY2024; opportunistic land buys (e.g., $100M+ in Q3). Past: Acquired Landsea Homes assets (2023, $5 lots in CA).\n- Potential: Speculated interest in small builders for lot supply (Barron's Oct 2024).\n\n## Current & Potential Major Clients\n- **Homebuyers**: Primarily first-time (40% of orders), millennials; institutional via builder incentives.\n- **Potential**: Active adults (growing 20% YoY); FHA/VA buyers amid rate sensitivity. Partnerships eye REITs for land (e.g., Landsee talks).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: 100% communities with solar-ready homes; 25% YoY reduction in water use (2024 Sustainability Report).\n- **Management**: CEO Jeffrey Mezger (since 2009), track record of 15% CAGR returns 2012-2023.\n- **Sentiment**: 12 Buy/7 Hold/0 Sell (Yahoo Analyst Consensus, Nov 2024 avg PT $71.94); online buzz on affordability edge (StockTwits 75% bullish).\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside/moderate risk).

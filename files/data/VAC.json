Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, VAC develops, markets, sells, and manages upper-upscale and luxury vacation ownership intervals under brands including Marriott Vacation Club, Sheraton Vacation Club, Westin Vacation Club, and Grand Residences by Marriott. The company serves over 700,000 owners worldwide through a network of ~120 resorts across 25 countries and territories, spanning the U.S., Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. VAC generates revenue through three main segments: North America Resort Development (~35% of revenue), North America Consumer Financing (~20%), and Resort Management (~25%), with international operations contributing the balance. It also owns Interval International, a leading vacation exchange network with 1.8 million+ members, facilitating trades among owners. VAC's business model relies on high-margin fee-for-service management (recurring revenue stream) and upfront sales of vacation ownership points/intervals, often financed in-house. As of Q2 2024, VAC reported $1.32 billion in quarterly revenue (up 6% YoY) and $535 million in Vacation Ownership Products contract sales (up 8% YoY), driven by strong domestic tour flow and pricing discipline amid a travel rebound. The company benefits from its Marriott affiliation for brand trust but faces cyclicality from economic sensitivity and interest rates.

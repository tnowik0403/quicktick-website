Headquartered in Lake Zurich, Illinois, the company operates in two main segments: **ACCO Brands North America** (which includes school and office products like Five Star notebooks, Mead paper, GBC binders, and Kensington computer locks) and **ACCO Brands EMEA** (Europe, Middle East, Africa, covering brands like Rapid staplers and NOBO whiteboards). With ~8,000 employees across 15 countries, ACCO generates revenue primarily from sales to retailers like Walmart, Staples, and Amazon, as well as direct B2B channels. In 2023, ~55% of sales came from North America, 35% EMEA, and 10% other international markets. The company emphasizes branded products in a fragmented market, with key categories including notebooks/filing (40% revenue), computer accessories (20%), laminating/binding (15%), and presentation boards (10%). Recent challenges include post-pandemic demand softness in office/school supplies, inflation-driven cost pressures, and high debt from past acquisitions. ACCO is pivoting toward deleveraging, innovation in digital security (e.g., Kensington), and premium school brands amid a shift to hybrid work/learning.

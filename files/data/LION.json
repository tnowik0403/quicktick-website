(LION) is an independent global entertainment studio specializing in the development, production, and worldwide distribution of feature films, episodic television series, and unscripted programming across theatrical, streaming, broadcast, and home entertainment platforms. Spun off from Lionsgate Entertainment Corp. (now focused on Starz streaming and other assets) via a tax-free distribution to shareholders completed on October 16, 2024, LION trades independently on Nasdaq since October 17, 2024. The studio boasts a vast library of over 19,000 feature film titles and 5,000 hours of TV content, anchored by marquee franchises like *John Wick*, *The Hunger Games*, *Saw*, and *Power*. It operates through three segments: Motion Picture (theatrical releases and VOD), Television Production (scripted/unscripted series for linear TV and streamers), and Global Distribution (licensing to 120+ countries). In FY2024 (ended March 31, 2024, pre-spin-off consolidated Lionsgate figures), the studio segment generated ~$1.9 billion in revenue, representing ~60% of parent company revenue, with key hits driving profitability amid a shift toward hybrid theatrical/streaming models. LION targets mid-budget films ($20-80M) to minimize risk while leveraging IP for high returns, positioning itself as a nimble alternative to Hollywood majors in a fragmented content market valued at $500B+ globally.

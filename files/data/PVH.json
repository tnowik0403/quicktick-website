Its portfolio is anchored by two powerhouse owned brands: Tommy Hilfiger (casual sportswear with preppy American heritage) and Calvin Klein (modern minimalist intimates, underwear, apparel, and accessories). PVH operates through a mix of wholesale (department stores, off-price retailers), direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels including over 1,500 owned stores and e-commerce sites, and licensing agreements generating royalties. The company reaches over 40 countries, with key markets in North America (40% of revenue), Europe (45%), and Asia (15%). PVH emphasizes \"product elevation\" to premiumize offerings, targeting millennials and Gen Z with sustainable, digitally native products. In FY2024 (ended Feb 2, 2024), PVH generated $9.22 billion in revenue, down 6% YoY amid post-pandemic normalization, but with strong gross margins of 56.1%. Strategically, PVH is accelerating DTC (now ~23% of revenue, up from 15% in 2020) and digital sales (32% of total), while optimizing wholesale partnerships and exiting underperforming licenses. Challenges include China softness and inventory management, but brand equity remains robust with $4B+ in global retail sales value.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (period ended Aug 4, 2024; reported Sep 5, 2024)**: Revenue $2.093B (-5% YoY, -6% cc), missing estimates of $2.12B; EPS $2.48 (beat est. $2.45); gross margin 57.3% (+190bps YoY); inventory down 11% to $1.1B.

That precision drives guest satisfaction and repeat business.\n- **International Expansion**: Strategic expansion into Canada and potentially the UK\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nTogether, we create memorable experiences for more than 440 million guests annually in communities across North America.

Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Fiscal 2026 Q1 Performance:**\nTotal sales increased 10.4% to $3.0 billion, driven by a blended same-restaurant sales increase of 4.7% and sales from the acquisition of 103 Chuy's Tex Mex (Chuy's) restaurants and 22 net new restaurants\n\nExcluding $0.02 of Chuy's transaction and integration related costs, $0.02 of closed restaurant costs and $(0.26) for the gain on the sale of Olive Garden Canada restaurants, adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.97, an increase of 12.6%\n\n**Fiscal 2025 Full Year:**\nHonestly, it comes down to scale and disciplined execution, which is why their fiscal 2025 total sales climbed to a record $12.1 billion, a solid 6.0% increase, even as many casual dining peers struggled. You see that strength in the core brands, where Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse delivered Q4 same-restaurant sales growth of 6.9% and 6.7% respectively\n\n**Financial Guidance:**\nDarden updated its fiscal 2026 outlook, now projecting total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.3%, including approximately 2% growth related to the 53rd week in the fiscal year. The company expects same-restaurant sales growth of 3.5% to 4.3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.50 to $10.70\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Current Headwinds:**\nDarden faces significant headwinds from rising food costs, particularly in key ingredients such as chicken and seafood. The company has reported that approximately 20% of its cost basket is imported, exposing it to potential tariff-related risks. These inflationary pressures are expected to intensify in the coming quarters, potentially squeezing profit margins.\n\nThe company expects total inflation of 3 percent to 5 percent in the fiscal year. Darden expects high single-digit inflation for seafood and beef, while other categories, such as dairy and wheat, will experience low single-digit inflation\n\nDarden's fine dining brands—Ruth's Chris and The Capital Grille—posted a 3.3% same-store sales decline, worse than the 0.2% dip analysts expected. This segment, which caters to higher-income diners, faces structural challenges: affluent consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, and fine dining's reliance on special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries) makes it less recession-resistant.\n\n**Key Tailwinds:**\nConversely, tailwinds such as the Social Security Fairness Act's one-time spending boost and lower gas prices may support dining-out activity\n\nYard House attracts a more affluent customer base with a trade area median household income of $82.6K compared to $69.0K to $70.1K for LongHorn and Olive Garden, respectively. This higher income profile may be making Yard House visitors less vulnerable to current consumer headwinds and helping boost the chain's traffic. Yet the continued strength of Olive Garden and LongHorn – despite their lower-income trade areas – underscores the resilience of these brands and shows how their broad appeal allows them to thrive even in more cost-sensitive markets.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTheir largest market share is in the Chain Restaurants industry, where they account for an estimated 5.0% of total industry revenue and are considered an All Star because they display stronger market share, profit and revenue growth compared to their peers.\n\nDarden Restaurants holds a commanding position in the full-service restaurant sector, driven by a diversified brand portfolio and consistent financial strength.

Strong brand equity, particularly for flagship brands, drives consistent sales and customer retention, a significant differentiator in the casual dining market share.\n\nAs of November 2025, the company commands a substantial market capitalization of approximately $20.40 billion, placing it firmly among the largest players in the casual dining segment. Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\n## 10.

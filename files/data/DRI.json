(NYSE: DRI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Stock Price**: $158.44\n- **Market Capitalization**: $18.92 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $139.00 - $173.17\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 20.12\n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.28% (quarterly dividend of $1.40/share declared Sep 19, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nDarden Restaurants, Inc. is the world's largest full-service restaurant company, operating over 1,900 restaurants across the United States and Canada under a portfolio of well-known brands. Its core segments include Olive Garden (casual Italian dining, ~900 locations), LongHorn Steakhouse (steakhouse, ~550 locations), and Fine Dining (The Capital Grille, Eddie V's, and Ruth's Chris Steak House, ~100 locations). Other brands like Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (~250), Yard House, Bahama Breeze, and Seasons 52 round out the mix. Darden emphasizes a \"multi-brand\" strategy, focusing on guest traffic through value-driven menus, loyalty programs (e.g., Olive Garden's eClub with 20M+ members), and digital ordering/to-go options, which account for ~20% of sales. The company generates revenue primarily from food and beverage sales (96% in FY2024), with catering and merchandise as minor contributors. In FY2024 (ended May 26, 2024), Darden served 500M+ meals, employing ~190,000 people. It prioritizes operational efficiency via supply chain control (self-distributes 40% of products), technology investments (e.g., AI-driven forecasting), and disciplined capital allocation, including $1B+ annual free cash flow. Darden's scale provides pricing power in a fragmented casual dining sector, though it faces macroeconomic pressures on consumer discretionary spending.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (Reported Sep 19, 2024)**: Total sales $2.76B (+6.5% YoY); blended same-restaurant sales +2.1%; restaurant-level margins 18.6% (+100 bps); diluted EPS $1.75 (beat estimates of $1.56).

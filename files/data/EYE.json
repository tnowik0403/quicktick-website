(NASDAQ: EYE) is a leading optical retailer in the U.S., operating approximately 1,400 stores across 13 states and Puerto Rico as of Q2 2024. The company provides affordable eye care services, prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses, and sunglasses through vertically integrated doctor-and-store models. Its primary brands include America's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses (over 900 locations, focusing on budget-friendly two-pair deals), Eyeglass World (value-oriented with in-house labs), and premium chains like VistaSi (Hispanic markets) and Owens (union-affiliated). National Vision emphasizes managed care partnerships, accepting major vision insurance plans like VSP, EyeMed, and Aetna, which drive ~80% of revenue. The company also operates a growing e-commerce platform and optical labs for rapid turnaround.\n\nFounded in 1990 and public since 2017, National Vision benefits from a fragmented $40B+ U.S. optical market, capturing share through aggressive pricing, high store density in suburban areas, and exam-driven sales (80%+ of patients buy eyewear post-exam). It reported Q2 2024 revenue of $512.2 million (+3.9% YoY), with comparable store sales up 0.7%, driven by traffic gains despite softer average ticket. Adjusted EBITDA was $45.1 million (margin 8.8%), reflecting cost controls amid inflation. With 12,000+ associates and a focus on Hispanic demographics (25%+ of stores), National Vision targets underserved segments while expanding digitally.

Established in 1950, F1 features high-speed racing with hybrid power units across a global calendar of 24 Grands Prix in 2024 spanning 21 countries on five continents, attracting over 1.5 billion cumulative TV viewers annually and peaking at 1.13 million U.S. TV viewers for the 2024 Miami GP (up 50% YoY per ESPN data). Revenue streams include media rights (47% of 2023 revenue), sponsorships (38%), race promotion (11%), and other (4% like hospitality and licensing). Liberty Media acquired control in January 2017 for $4.4 billion, transforming F1 into a media-entertainment powerhouse via digital innovation, U.S. market expansion, and premium content like Netflix's *Drive to Survive* (seasons 1-7 since 2019). Under CEO Stefano Domenicali (since 2021), F1 emphasizes sustainability (net-zero carbon by 2030), fan engagement via F1TV (3.3M subscribers as of Q2 2024), and diversification into gaming, arcades, and exhibitions. The business model leverages scarcity (fixed 24-race cap post-2026 Concorde Agreement) and sticky global fandom, driving 13% CAGR in revenue from 2017-2023. FWONA trades at a premium to peers due to its duopoly-like position in premium motorsport, with Series A/B/K shares reflecting different economic interests in Liberty's portfolio (Atlanta Braves, SiriusXM).

Compelling at 11x fwd P/E vs. 13x sector; 15-20% upside on 5% EPS CAGR, NIM to 4.2%. Growth from Sun Belt + M&A tailwinds outweigh CRE risks for moderate appetite.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $58 (20% upside from $48.24). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 5% perp growth); implies 1.6x TBV premium on ROE expansion.",

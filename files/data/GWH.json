Headquartered in Beijing with operations across China, the company leverages its proprietary platforms—such as SharkDay live streaming app and Cheche Live—to connect brands with consumers via short video content, influencer marketing, and real-time shopping. GWH operates two main segments: LSE (70%+ of revenue), which drives sales through live broadcasts featuring KOLs (key opinion leaders), and comprehensive services including ad placement, content production, and supply chain management. \n\nFounded in 2015 and listed on Nasdaq in 2019 via SPAC merger, GWH has pivoted from traditional TV media to digital ecosystems amid China's booming LSE market (valued at ~RMB 5 trillion in 2023). It reported explosive growth post-2023, fueled by post-COVID e-commerce recovery. With ~500 employees and partnerships with top platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou, GWH emphasizes AI integration for personalized recommendations. Challenges include regulatory scrutiny on LSE and competition from giants, but its niche in niche beauty/health products positions it for mid-tier growth in a fragmented market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 14, 2024)**: Revenue $41.8 million (RMB 303.5 million, +33% YoY); Gross profit $12.6 million (gross margin 30.1%); Net income $2.5 million (vs. loss prior year).

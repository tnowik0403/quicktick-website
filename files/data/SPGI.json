S&P Global and Moody's share their foundation in credit ratings with a combined ~80% market share (~20% for Fitch) in the ~$12 trillion in annual global rated debt issuance.\n\nIt is commonly written into investment mandates that investors can only buy debt rated by one of the two major credit agencies, S&P and Moody's.\n\n## 9.

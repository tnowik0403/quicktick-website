(NYSE: OHI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, verified from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $39.47  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $9.32 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $27.99 – $41.98  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 7.4% (annualized $2.92/share, last ex-date Sep 30, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview  \nOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (OHI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the long-term healthcare real estate sector. Founded in 1992 and headquartered in Hunt Valley, Maryland, OHI owns and leases a portfolio of over 940 healthcare facilities, primarily skilled nursing facilities (SNFs, ~80% of portfolio), assisted living facilities (ALFs, ~15%), and independent living/senior housing (~5%). The company operates under triple-net leases, where operators (tenants) bear most property-related costs, providing OHI with stable, predictable cash flows.  \n\nAs of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 1, 2024), OHI's portfolio spans 41 states and the U.K., with total investments of $10.1 billion across 928 real estate properties and two mortgage loans. Revenue is derived almost entirely from rental income (99%+), with tenants including leading operators like CommuniCare Health Centers, Saber Health Group, and Ciena Healthcare. OHI benefits from demographic tailwinds like the aging U.S. population (65+ expected to double by 2050 per U.S. Census). However, it faces operator credit risks and reimbursement pressures. The REIT structure requires 90%+ income distribution as dividends, yielding high investor appeal for income-focused portfolios. Recent strategic shifts emphasize portfolio diversification into ALFs and outpatient facilities while exiting underperforming SNF assets.

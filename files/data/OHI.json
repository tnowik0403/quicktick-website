Company Overview\n\nOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc. is a Real Estate Investment Trust (\"REIT\") that provides financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry, with a particular focus on skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility operators. The company operates through a single segment, which invests in healthcare-related real estate properties located in the United States and the United Kingdom. Its core business is to provide financing and capital to the long-term healthcare industry with a particular focus on skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), assisted living facilities (ALFs), and to a lesser extent, independent living facilities (ILFs), rehabilitation and acute care facilities (specialty facilities) and medical office buildings (MOBs).\n\nAs of September 30, 2025, Omega has a portfolio of investments that includes 1,024 operating facilities located in 42 states, the District of Columbia and the United Kingdom/Jersey (290 facilities) and operated by 88 different operators. These specialized properties are leased to operators on a triple-net basis, meaning the tenants are responsible for most of the property-level expenses, including insurance, maintenance, and taxes. This business model provides Omega with an opportunity to secure a steady flow of rental income while minimizing its day-to-day operational responsibilities—a hallmark characteristic that defines its financial strategy.\n\n## 2.

Existing Products/Services\n\n**Core Business Model:**\nThe company's core products and services include ownership and leasing of healthcare properties such as skilled nursing facilities, assisted living and memory care communities, and other medical-related real estate assets. Omega Healthcare Investors operates its portfolio across the United States, providing long-term real estate solutions primarily to healthcare operators.\n\n**Property Portfolio Breakdown:**\n- As of Q4 2023, Omega Healthcare Investors owned 969 healthcare properties across 41 states. Total real estate investment portfolio valued at $9.4 billion. Average property size: 64,000 square feet.\n- Occupancy rate across portfolio: 83.7% as of December 31, 2023.

Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Strategic Investment Expansion:**\nOmega's plans to target health care real estate acquisitions and expand investment in joint ventures, minority equity stakes, and right-to-use arrangements. The Hunt Valley, MD-based REIT is expanding its investments and opportunities, including joint ventures and RIDEA (REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act)-like structures.\n\n**Ongoing Investment Activity:**\nWe have accretively invested nearly $1 billion year-to-date and, as a result, we are increasing our 2025 AFFO guidance again to now be between $3.08 and $3.10 per share, up from our initial guidance range of between $2.90 and $2.98 per share.\n\n**Future Acquisition Strategy:**\nFavorable acquisition environment in U.S. skilled nursing and U.K. care homes; majority of opportunities sourced through existing relationships and focus on underperforming assets below replacement cost.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nThe core driver is the increasing demand for post-acute and long-term care, fueled by the aging Baby Boomer generation. This trend supports operator occupancy and, therefore, rent payments. We believe we are extremely well positioned to enhance shareholder returns by acquiring underperforming assets at prices meaningfully below replacement cost and partnering with proven operators to significantly enhance the cash flow, and hence, value of such assets.\n\n**Key Strategic Elements:**\n- Flexible Capital Toolkit: They've moved beyond just the traditional triple-net lease, strategically expanding into joint ventures and minority equity investments. This adaptive strategy allows them to partner more closely with high-performing operators like Saber Healthcare Holdings, LLC, and capture higher risk-adjusted returns.\n- Scale and Liquidity: With $11.4 billion in total real estate investments, OHI is a major player, giving it preferential access to capital and off-market deal flow that smaller competitors can't touch.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Operator Diversification:**\nThe portfolio is spread across 88 third-party operators, with no single operator accounting for 10% or more of total rent/interest as of September 30, 2025. This limits the risk from any one tenant's financial distress.\n\n**Key Client Relationships:**\n- **Saber Healthcare:** Acquired a 49% equity interest in an entity majority-owned by affiliates of Omega's operator, Saber Healthcare Holdings, LLC (\"Saber\"), that holds a portfolio of 64 facilities, for total consideration of $222 million in October 2025.\n- **Genesis Healthcare:** As a reminder, Omega leases Genesis thirty-one facilities for an annual rent payment of $52 million. Additionally, Omega has a $125 million term loan with Genesis, which is secured by a first lien on the equity of Genesis' four ancillary businesses.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Adjusted Funds From Operations (\"AFFO\") for the quarter of $243 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $203 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for Q3 2024.\n- Revenue of $312 million in revenue in the third quarter due to investment activity, up from $276 million in Q3 2024.\n- Net income for the quarter of $185 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $115 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for Q3 2024.\n\n**2024 Performance:**\nIn 2024, OHI's revenue was $1.05 billion, an increase of 10.70% compared to the previous year's $949.74 million. Earnings were $406.33 million, an increase of 67.78%.\n\n**Balance Sheet Strength:**\n- $737 million in cash as of September 30, 2025. Entered into a new $2.3 billion credit facility (including a $2 billion revolver) in the third quarter of 2025; leverage reduced to 3.59x as of September 30, 2025.\n- Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio: 5.1 times.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nWe are increasing our 2025 AFFO guidance again to now be between $3.08 and $3.10 per share.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Major Tailwinds:**\n- **Demographic Trends:** By 2030, all baby boomers will be age 65 or older. And by 2040, roughly 78.3 million Americans will fall within that age group. The oldest baby boomers turned 78 this year.\n- **Operational Improvements:** Omega's portfolio occupancy and coverage metrics have improved, with EBITDAR coverage at its highest level in twelve years, suggesting strong operational performance.\n\n**Key Headwinds:**\n- **Genesis Bankruptcy:** Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (\"Genesis\") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 9, 2025. In the third quarter of 2025, Genesis made all required contractual rent and interest payments.\n- **Medicare/Medicaid Cuts:** The automatic 4% cut in Medicare scheduled for early 2026 due to the deficit caused by the OBBVA has not been addressed legislatively, posing a potential risk to revenue.\n- **Regulatory Pressures:** There is ongoing concern about potential Medicaid cuts and state budget constraints, which could indirectly affect Omega's operations and profitability.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Market Position:**\nOmega Healthcare Investors' market capitalization of approximately $13.65 billion as of November 2025 makes it significantly larger than its SNF-focused rivals, CareTrust REIT at about $8.16 billion and Sabra Health Care REIT at roughly $3.89 billion.\n\n**Industry Context:**\nThe market is being shaped by industry giants such as Welltower Inc. ($82.34B market cap), Ventas Inc. ($24.94B), and Healthpeak Properties Inc. ($14.44B). These players dominate due to their scale, diversification, and strategic partnerships. Welltower, in particular, maintains the largest and most varied portfolio among healthcare REITs, spanning senior housing, outpatient facilities, and health systems.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Size Positioning:**\nOmega Healthcare Investors is a leading force in the specialized healthcare real estate sector, particularly in skilled nursing, but it operates within a landscape dominated by much larger, more diversified healthcare REITs like Welltower and Ventas. Welltower, for example, has a market cap of over $95 billion, which is more than seven times Omega Healthcare Investors' size.\n\n**Competitive Set:**\nCareTrust sits in the healthcare REIT world alongside Welltower (WELL), Ventas (VTR), Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI), and National Health Investors (NHI).\n\n**Specialization Advantage:**\nOmega Healthcare has the largest portfolio of skilled nursing facilities, the second largest in its peer group, Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA), owns less than half the amount of properties that Omega Healthcare owns. This provides some advantages in terms of scale and size, and should, theoretically, result in more efficient operations.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major 2025 Partnership - Saber Healthcare:**\nOmega received a 49% stake in exchange for 5.5 million equity units in its operating partnership subsidiary, convertible one-for-one into Omega common stock, while Saber affiliates retained 51%. The JV's facilities generate $69.4 million in annual rent under triple-net leases and carry $448.6 million in non-recourse mortgage debt at a 6.1% average interest rate.\n\n**Investment Activity 2025:**\n- Completed approximately $151 million in Q3 new investments consisting of $67 million in real estate acquisitions, $8 million in real estate loans and $76 million in other investments.\n- Completed approximately $527 million in Q2 new investments consisting of $502 million in real estate acquisitions and $25 million in real estate loans.\n\n**Strategic Expansion:**\nThe Company will partner with affiliates of Saber to explore additional acquisitions of senior healthcare facilities by the JV.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Q3 2025 Highlights:**\n- Issued 2 million common shares in Q3 for gross proceeds of $89 million. Entered into a new $2.3 billion senior unsecured credit facility, replacing the previous $1.45 billion credit facility.\n- Repaid $600 million of senior unsecured notes at par value on October 15, 2025.\n\n**Analyst Updates:**\n- January 2026: Omega Healthcare initiated with a Buy at Goldman Sachs, Omega Healthcare price target raised to $51 from $50 at UBS, BMO Capital downgrades Omega Healthcare (OHI) to a Hold.\n\n**Financial Performance:**\nFull-year 2025 AFFO guidance was raised and narrowed to $3.08–$3.10 per share, with the midpoint representing 8% YoY growth over 2024 AFFO.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Strengths:**\n- Strong demographic tailwinds from aging baby boomer population\n- Diversified operator base reducing tenant concentration risk\n- Improving operational metrics with EBITDAR coverage at 12-year highs\n- Strong balance sheet with reduced leverage (3.59x) and substantial liquidity\n- Active investment pipeline with nearly $1 billion deployed in 2025\n- Attractive dividend yield around 6% with improving coverage ratios\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- Genesis bankruptcy exposure (~$52 million annual rent)\n- Potential Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement cuts\n- Regulatory headwinds in skilled nursing sector\n- Higher operational risk compared to diversified healthcare REITs\n\n**Financial Assessment:**\nBased on the company's improved financial metrics, strong demographic tailwinds, and successful capital deployment strategy, coupled with a dividend payout ratio that has improved to sustainable levels (85-89%), OHI presents a compelling value proposition in the healthcare REIT space.\n\n**AI Investment Rating: 7.8/10**\n\nThis rating reflects OHI's solid fundamentals, strong demographic positioning, and improving operational metrics, tempered by sector-specific risks and ongoing regulatory uncertainties.\n\n**Estimated Fair Value: $48-52**\n\nThe fair value range is based on:\n- Current analyst price targets averaging ~$46.47\n- 2025 AFFO guidance of $3.08-$3.10 suggesting sustainable earnings growth\n- Demographic tailwinds supporting long-term demand\n- Comparable REIT valuations in the healthcare space\n- Risk premium for skilled nursing facility concentration\n\nFor investors seeking strong growth upside with moderate risk appetite, OHI offers an attractive entry point near current levels, with the potential for both dividend income growth and capital appreciation as demographic trends accelerate and operational metrics continue improving.",

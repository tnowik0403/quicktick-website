(MXL) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in high-performance analog, radio frequency (RF), and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) for connectivity, communications infrastructure, and industrial applications. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Carlsbad, California, MaxLinear serves markets including broadband access (cable, PON, satellite), wireless infrastructure (5G small cells, massive MIMO), networking (Ethernet, PCIe), and industrial IoT (sensors, edge computing). Key product lines include RF transceivers, power management ICs, data converters, embedded modems (DOCSIS, MoCA), and connectivity SoCs.  \n\nThe company targets high-growth areas like next-gen cable broadband (DOCSIS 4.0), fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) PON, data center interconnects for AI/ML, and 5G radio units. MaxLinear's solutions enable service providers to deliver multi-gigabit speeds while reducing power and cost. With ~1,200 employees and design centers globally, it leverages advanced nodes (7nm-16nm) from TSMC and others. Revenue is diversified: ~45% infrastructure (cable/wireless), ~30% broadband, ~15% networking, ~10% industrial/other (Q2 2024 breakdown). Despite cyclical downturns, MaxLinear benefits from secular trends in bandwidth demand driven by streaming, cloud, and 5G. Challenges include inventory gluts in cable and competition from integrated giants. Recent strategic shifts emphasize accretive M&A and R&D in AI-edge computing to counter commoditization risks.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 7, 2024)**: Revenue $92.6M (vs. $158.1M YoY, -41% due to cable inventory correction); GAAP net loss $38.0M; Non-GAAP EPS -$0.28 (beat estimates).

(FLOC) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Note on Status**: FLOC was acquired by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) on November 6, 2023, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $7 billion ($53.70 per share). The company was delisted from NASDAQ effective November 7, 2023, and is no longer publicly traded. No current stock price or market capitalization exists on public exchanges. Analysis reflects latest available public data (up to delisting) and post-acquisition updates from verified sources (e.g., company filings, CD&R announcements, Seeking Alpha transcripts, Bloomberg, Reuters – searched October 2023 to present). No public earnings reports post-Q2 2023 (ended June 30, 2023); thus, no quantitative financials from sources <6 months old are included.\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFocus Financial Partners Inc. (FLOC) was a diversified holding company and leading partnership platform in the wealth management sector, primarily serving high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, families, endowments, and institutions. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in New York City, FLOC operated by acquiring minority stakes (typically 50-90%) in independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) and wealth management firms, providing operational support, shared services, technology, marketing, and capital access while preserving partner firm autonomy and entrepreneurial culture. \n\nAs of Q2 2023, the platform included ~120 partner firms across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, managing over $510 billion in client assets under management (AUM). Revenue was generated via fee-based models (90%+ recurring), including assets under management (primarily 0.5-1.5% fees), financial planning, tax/estate services, and alternatives (e.g., private equity, hedge funds). FLOC targeted \"high-insight\" firms with specialized expertise in niches like family offices, tech entrepreneurs, athletes, and alternatives, differentiating from cookie-cutter robo-advisors. The model emphasized organic growth + M&A tuck-ins, scaling via best-practice sharing (e.g., centralized tech stack like Black Diamond CRM). Post-acquisition by CD&R, FLOC continues as a private entity, with CD&R committing $1B+ in growth capital to accelerate RIA partnerships and tech investments amid industry consolidation.

Private status suits long-term holders but offers no liquidity/upside for public portfolios. Avoid; monitor for potential re-IPO (unlikely pre-2027).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: N/A (private). Hypothetical public relisting: $60-65/share (15% premium to deal, factoring CD&R growth execution + 10% AUM CAGR), implying 20% upside from last price for growth-oriented moderate-risk portfolios – but inaccessible. Hold private exposure if any; sell any residual OTC shares.",

Company Overview\n\nAlcoa Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production, and energy generation business in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Spain, the United States, and internationally. Alcoa Corporation (an acronym for \"Aluminum Company of America\") is an American industrial corporation that produces aluminum. According to industry rankings, it is among the largest producers globally. Alcoa is one of the world's largest bauxite miners with high-quality reserves and a first-quartile cost position.\n\nThe company operates through two main segments: Alumina and Aluminum. Alcoa's global alumina portfolio is the largest outside of China and the largest third-party supplier of alumina with the globe's lowest carbon footprint. Alcoa is a leading producer of value-add primary aluminum products, (billet, foundry, rod and slab) and has a portfolio of patented cast alloys, as well as low-carbon aluminum through its SustanaTM line of products.\n\nOn October 21, 2025, the Australian and U.S. governments signed a deal on rare-earth and critical minerals, by which the U.S. would provide investment for development of a processing plant for gallium at one of the Alcoa refineries in Wagerup, in association with the Japanese corporation Sojitz. Gallium is an essential component in the manufacture of microchips. Once the project is up and running, the plant would provide up to 10 per cent of total global gallium supply, and will be a major player in the Australian rare-earths industry.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Primary Business Segments:**\n\n**Bauxite Mining:**\n• Through its sole ownership and equity interests, Alcoa has access to bauxite reserves at seven global mines in Australia, Brazil, Guinea and Saudi Arabia. Alcoa owns and operates two mines in Western Australia (Huntly and Willowdale) and two in Brazil (Juruti and Poços de Caldas).\n\n**Alumina Refining:**\n• The company's portfolio of seven refineries holds a highly competitive, first-quartile cost curve position. In addition, the six global refining assets that we operate in Australia, Brazil and Spain are located near key markets in the Atlantic and Pacific.\n\n**Aluminum Production:**\n• The Aluminum segment includes smelting, casting, and select energy assets. Alcoa is a leading producer of value-add primary aluminum products, (billet, foundry, rod and slab) and has a portfolio of patented cast alloys, as well as low-carbon aluminum through its SustanaTM line of products.\n\n**Energy Generation:**\n• The energy portfolio, which includes partnerships and wholly-owned assets, supplies power internally and also generates revenue from third-party sales.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**San Ciprián Smelter Restart:**\n• The restart of the San Ciprian smelter is progressing well, with 65% of capacity in operation by the end of 2025. Management expects the San Ciprian combined smelter and refinery to post an EBITDA loss of $75 million-$100 million and free cash flow consumption of $100 million-$130 million in 2026, targeting cash neutrality for the site in 2027.\n\n**Gallium Production Partnership:**\n• Alcoa announced a strategic partnership with the US, Australian, and Japanese governments to develop a gallium plant, enhancing its role in the critical mineral supply chain. The approvals process is expected to be swift, with production targeted by the end of 2026.\n\n**Site Monetization Program:**\n• The timeline has been extended to ensure maximum value is achieved, with expectations to conclude in the first half of 2026. Alcoa is targeting $500 million to $1 billion from 10 priority sites over the next five years.\n\n## 4.

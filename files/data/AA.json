Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Alcoa mines bauxite in Australia (Huntly mine), refines it into alumina at facilities in Australia (Kwinana, Pinjarra, and Wagerup) and Spain (San Ciprián), and smelts it into primary aluminum at smelters in the U.S. (Warrick, Indiana), Spain (San Ciprián), Iceland (Fjarðaál), Canada (Deschambault), and Norway (Listogil, acquired via Halco deal). The company focuses on value-added aluminum products like billets, foundry alloys, and grain-oriented electrical steel, targeting high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), aerospace, packaging, and renewable energy infrastructure.  \n\nAlcoa emphasizes sustainability, producing low-carbon \"ELYSIS\" aluminum via proprietary technology (jointly developed with Rio Tinto) that eliminates greenhouse gas emissions from smelting. With ~13,400 employees, Alcoa generated $10.5B in third-party revenue in FY 2023. Spun off from Alcoa Inc. in 2016, it has pursued restarts of idled capacity amid volatile LME aluminum prices, energy costs, and Chinese oversupply. Recent restarts (e.g., Warrick smelter) position it for demand recovery in green aluminum markets. Challenges include high production costs and geopolitical risks in Australia/Spain, but tailwinds from U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives support expansion.\n\n## Current Stock Metrics (as of October 17, 2024)\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $42.00 (Yahoo Finance, post-Q3 earnings)\n- **Market Capitalization**: $7.51B (Yahoo Finance)\n- **52-Week Range**: $22.67 - $42.45\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (negative earnings)\n- **EV/EBITDA**: 8.2x (forward)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **October 16, 2024**: Q3 2024 earnings released – Third-party aluminum sales of $2.40B (up 5% YoY), Adjusted EBITDA $220M (beat estimates by $50M), driven by higher LME prices ($2,500+/ton) and Warrick rolling operations restart.

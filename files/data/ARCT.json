Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** November 12, 2024 (based on real-time data from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site, BioSpace, FierceBiotech, and recent earnings transcripts as of Q3 2024 release on November 11, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview\nArcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ARCT) is a late-stage clinical mRNA medicines company leveraging its proprietary LUNAR® lipid-mediated delivery platform to develop nucleic acid-based therapeutics and vaccines. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, Arcturus focuses on self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) technology, which enables lower dosing, longer duration of expression, and potentially improved immunogenicity compared to conventional mRNA. The company's lead product, KOSTAIVE® (ARCT-154), is the world's first approved sa-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, authorized in Japan on July 29, 2024, via partner Meiji Seika Pharma. Arcturus targets infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19, influenza) and rare diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). Its pipeline emphasizes needle-free delivery via STARR® mRNA and LUNAR® nanoparticles. With ~150 employees, Arcturus has demonstrated manufacturing scalability, producing over 23 million doses of ARCT-154. Revenue is milestone- and royalty-driven from partnerships, positioning it for commercialization amid a shifting mRNA landscape post-COVID. The company reported Q3 2024 revenue of $58.3 million (up 88% YoY), driven by CSL partnership milestones, though it remains pre-profitability with a cash runway into 2026. Market cap reflects high growth potential in sa-mRNA but biotech volatility.

Formed in 2020 from the merger of Rubicon Project and Telaria, Magnite focuses on high-value video and CTV inventory, which now represents ~60% of its revenue. It serves a global network of 3,800+ sellers and 180+ buyers, emphasizing transparency, privacy-compliant solutions (e.g., post-cookie alternatives), and AI-driven optimization. With headquarters in New York and ~1,000 employees, Magnite generated $614 million in 2023 revenue, positioning it as a key player in the $100B+ digital ad supply chain amid the shift to streaming and programmatic video.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Reported Q2 2024 earnings (quarter ended June 30, 2024): Revenue $160.4 million (+7% YoY), CTV revenue +26% YoY to ~$60 million (est.), adjusted EBITDA $44.0 million (margin 27.5%), net loss $25.6 million.

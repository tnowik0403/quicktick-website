Founded in 1891, it operates through segments including Grocery Products (37% of FY2024 sales), Refrigerated Foods (43%), Jennie-O Turkey Store (12%), and International/Other (8%). Iconic brands include Spam, Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Applegate Farms natural meats, Skippy peanut butter, Planters nuts, and Justin's nut butters. The company processes and markets pork, turkey, beef, chicken, nuts, and other proteins globally, with ~20% of sales international.\n\nHormel emphasizes innovation in convenient, protein-rich foods amid rising consumer demand for natural, organic, and plant-based options. It serves retail (e.g., Walmart, Kroger), foodservice (e.g., Sysco), and international markets via exports and JVs. FY2023 sales reached $12.1B, with a focus on margin expansion through pricing, supply chain efficiencies, and portfolio optimization. Recent challenges include commodity volatility (pork, turkey cycles) and inflation, but strengths lie in a diversified brand portfolio, 58-year dividend increase streak, and acquisitions like Planters (2021) and Applegate (2011).

Higher rates, international momentum, and undervaluation (P/B 0.85 vs. historical 1.0) support outperformance vs. sector. Hold for conservative; avoid if yen strengthens sharply.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $18.50** (25% upside). Based on 12x FY2025 EPS consensus ¥170 ($1.13 at 150JPY/USD), 1.0x P/B target, and 10% ROE perpetuity DCF (moderate risk: beta 1.1, assumes 2% GDP Japan growth).",

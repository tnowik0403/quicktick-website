Claude's Sonnet 4.5 has access to up-to-date information, but is considerably more expensive per output (nearly $1 per ticker). In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(NASDAQ: AMPL) is a leading provider of digital analytics and optimization software, enabling companies to build better products through data-driven insights. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, CA, Amplitude's cloud-based platform helps organizations analyze user behavior across web and mobile applications, measure product performance, and run experiments to drive growth. Its core offerings focus on product analytics, allowing teams to track metrics like engagement, retention, and conversion in real-time, without requiring engineering resources for custom dashboards.\n\nThe company targets product-led growth (PLG) strategies, serving high-growth tech firms, e-commerce, media, and enterprises. Amplitude processes billions of events daily, leveraging machine learning for behavioral cohorting, funnel analysis, and personalization recommendations. With over 2,700 customers (as of Q2 2024), it emphasizes self-serve adoption for SMBs and enterprise-scale deployments with features like session replay and customer data platforms (CDP). Revenue is primarily subscription-based (96% recurring), with annual recurring revenue (ARR) as the key growth metric. Amplitude went public in September 2021 at ~$50/share but has traded lower amid macro headwinds. The digital analytics market, valued at ~$12B in 2024 (growing 15% CAGR per Gartner), benefits from AI integration and rising demand for user-centric metrics amid app proliferation. However, Amplitude faces competition and churn pressures in a maturing PLG landscape.

Fundamentals show stabilization (profitable path by 2026 at 15% growth), but ARR deceleration and 4x EV/ARR (vs. peers 8x+) limit upside amid macro caution. Suits moderate risk/growth portfolios.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $12.50/share (38% upside). Based on 6x FY25 ARR ($265M consensus) + 20% terminal growth discount (10% rate); DCF aligns post-Q3 if beats guidance. Risks: Recession deepens churn (downside $7).",

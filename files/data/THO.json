(NYSE: THO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $105.82\n- Market Capitalization: $5.59 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $72.67 - $119.98\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 20.3\n- Dividend Yield: 1.47% ($1.54 annual)\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nTHOR Industries, Inc. (THO) is the world's largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles (RVs), dominating the North American market with a portfolio of over 20 premium brands. Founded in 1980 and headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana (the \"RV Capital of the World\"), the company produces towable RVs (travel trailers, fifth wheels) and motorized RVs (Class A, B, C motorhomes). Key brands include Airstream (iconic aluminum trailers), Keystone, Jayco, Heartland, Dutchmen, and Forest River (acquired in 2016). THOR sells primarily through a network of ~2,200 independent dealers in North America and expanding international markets like Europe and Australia via subsidiaries such as Erwin Hymer Group (acquired 2019). In FY2024 (ended July 27, 2024), THOR shipped ~260,000 units amid industry cyclicality. The company benefits from vertical integration, including chassis manufacturing via Thor Motor Coach partnerships. Recent focus on premiumization, electrification pilots, and dealer inventory normalization positions THOR for recovery as interest rates ease and demographics (baby boomer retirees, millennials) drive demand. However, high wholesale inventories and affordability challenges have pressured near-term volumes.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q1 FY2025 Earnings (announced December 5, 2024; period ended October 28, 2024)**: Net sales $1.70 billion (down 26.6% YoY from $2.32B); GAAP diluted EPS $0.99 (vs. $1.69); gross margin 15.4% (up 110 bps YoY).

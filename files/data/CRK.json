(CRK) is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company focused exclusively on natural gas, with all operations in the Haynesville Shale formation spanning North Louisiana and East Texas. Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Frisco, Texas, CRK holds approximately 209,000 net acres (post-recent acquisitions) in this premier natural gas play, emphasizing low-cost drilling and completions to maximize inventory life. The company operates as a pure-play producer, deriving nearly 100% of revenue from natural gas sales, with production averaging ~1.4 Bcf/d in recent quarters. CRK's strategy centers on capital-efficient development of its high-quality acreage, targeting extended lateral wells (up to 20,000+ feet) in the Mid-Bossier and Hosston sands for superior economics. Amid rising U.S. LNG export demand, CRK positions itself as a key supplier to Gulf Coast infrastructure, benefiting from proximity to major pipelines and export terminals like Plaquemines LNG and Golden Pass. Financially disciplined, CRK returned ~$200M to shareholders via buybacks in 2024 YTD while maintaining a debt-free balance sheet post-2021 refinancing. With a vast drilling inventory (>1,000 locations), CRK aims for multi-decade sustainability in a volatile commodity market, navigating low NYMEX prices (~$2.50/MMBtu) through cost reductions (DD&A ~$1.20/Mcf).

Strong inventory/costs offset near-term low prices; LNG tailwinds support 20-30% upside in 12-18 months. Moderate risk from unhedged exposure.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $12.50/share (35% upside). Based on 5x 2025E EV/DCAP (~$2.50/Mcf gas avg.); DCF assumes $3.00/MMBtu 2025-2026 ramp. Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios tolerant of energy volatility.",

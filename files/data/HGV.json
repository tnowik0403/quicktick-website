(NYSE: HGV) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NYSE):**\n- Stock Price: $42.37\n- Market Capitalization: $4.22 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $31.19 - $49.73\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 20.8\n- Dividend Yield: 0% (suspended)\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nHilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV) is a leading global vacation ownership and timeshare company, operating as the exclusive vacation ownership sales, marketing, and resort management company for Hilton's timeshare properties. Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, HGV markets its points-based vacation ownership products under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand, providing owners flexible access to over 150 resorts worldwide, including Hilton-branded properties and exchange partners via RCI (a subsidiary). The company generates revenue primarily through vacation ownership contract sales (tour sales conversions), financing of owner purchases, and resort management fees.\n\nHGV serves affluent leisure travelers seeking recurring vacations, with a focus on North America (80%+ of sales), Japan, and emerging international markets. In 2023, it sold ~18,000 vacation ownership intervals. The business model benefits from high-margin fee-for-service revenue (resort/club management) and recurring interest income from owner financing. Post its transformative $1.5B acquisition of Bluegreen Vacations (completed January 25, 2024), HGV has expanded to ~220 resorts, ~214,000 owners, and ~180,000 units under management, positioning it as the largest pure-play vacation ownership company. Growth is driven by Hilton affiliation, digital sales channels, and inventory expansion, though sensitive to economic cycles and interest rates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024)**: Contract sales $605 million (+19% YoY); resort/club management fees $318 million (+65% YoY, boosted by Bluegreen); total revenue $1.1 billion (+52% YoY); Adjusted EBITDA $255 million (+70% YoY).

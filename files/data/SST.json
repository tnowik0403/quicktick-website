(NYSE: SST) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Price**: $2.78\n- **Market Cap**: $316.4 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $1.32 - $9.25\n- **Avg.

(SST) is a consumer internet company specializing in privacy-focused digital media and advertising technology. Founded in 2013 and public since 2021 via SPAC merger, SST operates a portfolio of owned-and-operated web properties that deliver targeted, high-intent consumer traffic to advertisers while prioritizing user privacy. Key assets include Startpage (privacy-centric search engine acquired in 2022), content sites like HowStuffWorks and MapQuest, and programmatic ad platforms like Yardline. Unlike traditional ad tech firms reliant on third-party cookies, SST leverages first-party data from its 100+ million monthly users across 20+ properties to serve compliant, high-ROI ads. Revenue is primarily from search and display advertising (95%+), with a focus on \"choice media\" – user-selected, non-intrusive formats. SST aims to capitalize on growing privacy demands amid Google's cookie deprecation and regulatory scrutiny (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Headquartered in Los Angeles, the company reported $432.6 million in trailing 12-month revenue as of Q2 2024 but faces profitability challenges amid ad market softness.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 14, 2024)**: Revenue $118.0 million (flat YoY from $118.0 million); Adjusted EBITDA -$2.6 million (vs. -$13.8 million YoY improvement); Net loss $20.0 million.

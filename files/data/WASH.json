wealth platform via Envestnet (announced expansion May 2024).\n- **M&A**: No deals since 2019 acquisition of small RI advisory; monitoring tuck-in wealth buys (potential 2025).\n- **Major Clients**: Local RI/CT firms (e.g., healthcare like South County Hospital, manufacturing); high-net-worth families. Potential: Expanding to larger New England corporates post-digital upgrades.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong community reinvestment (CRA rating \"Outstanding\"); low CRE delinquency (0.3%).\n- **Management**: CEO Joe Marcello (since 2019) focused on capital returns (payout ratio 70%).\n- **Risk Profile**: Low (Tier 1 capital 12.5%); Moody's Baa2 rating.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Hold** with upside potential). Attractive yield and conservative balance sheet support holding; growth limited by regional focus but rate cuts could drive 10-15% EPS growth in 2025.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $35.00 (22% upside). Based on 1.75x 2025E TBV ($20/share) + DCF (8% discount rate, 4% perpetual growth), assuming 3% loan/5% fee growth, NIM expansion to 2.9%.

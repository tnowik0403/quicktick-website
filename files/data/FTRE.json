(NASDAQ: FTRE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close - verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $6.62\n- Market Capitalization: $510.3 million\n- 52-Week Range: $6.00 - $37.57\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 1.2 million shares\n- Enterprise Value: $3.9 billion (includes $3.4B net debt)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nFortrea Holdings Inc. (FTRE) is a global contract research organization (CRO) providing comprehensive clinical development services across Phase I-IV trials. Spun off from Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Labcorp) on November 1, 2023, Fortrea operates as an independent entity focused on therapeutic innovation in high-growth areas like oncology, rare diseases, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The company offers end-to-end solutions including clinical trial design, patient recruitment, data management, biostatistics, regulatory consulting, and commercialization services. With approximately 19,000 employees across 90+ countries, Fortrea serves pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device clients, managing a $10.2 billion backlog (Q2 2024). It generated $3.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue post-spin, positioning it as a mid-tier CRO in a $75 billion+ global market. Fortrea differentiates through deep therapeutic expertise (e.g., 25% of backlog in oncology), advanced technologies like AI-driven trial optimization, and a decentralized trial platform launched in 2023. Despite post-spin challenges like revenue contraction from lab service divestitures, the company targets 5-7% organic growth via backlog conversion and new business wins.

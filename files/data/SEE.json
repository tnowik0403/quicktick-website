Founded in 1960 and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company operates through two main segments: Food (63% of 2023 sales) and Protective (37%). In Food, SEE provides vacuum packaging systems like Cryovac® for proteins, liquids, and produce, enhancing freshness, safety, and shelf life for meat, poultry, seafood, and cheese processors. Protective offerings include Bubble Wrap®, Instapak® foams, and mailers for e-commerce and industrial shipping. With ~17,000 employees across 50+ countries, SEE generated $5.10 billion in 2023 net sales, emphasizing sustainability through recyclable, bio-based materials. The company leverages automation, digital tools like SEE Cloud for monitoring, and a portfolio of 5,000+ patents to drive efficiency. Recent strategic shifts focus on divesting non-core assets to streamline toward higher-margin food and protective growth, amid a packaging industry valued at ~$1 trillion globally, where SEE holds niche leadership in vacuum shrink bags (~25-30% share in proteins) and air cushions (~20% in e-commerce protective).

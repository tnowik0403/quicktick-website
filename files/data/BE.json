Growth Strategy\n\n**AI Data Center Focus:**\nBloom Energy transitioned from a clean-energy alternative to a critical infrastructure provider, capped by a massive $5 billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management. The timeline of Bloom's dominance is closely tied to the \"grid gap\"—the five-to-seven-year waiting period many data center developers face when trying to connect to the traditional power grid. In mid-2025, Bloom began signing a series of \"time-to-power\" agreements that promised on-site energy deployment in as little as 90 days.\n\n**Geographic Expansion:**\nThe two companies are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally, including a site in Europe that will be announced before the end of the year.\n\n**Dual-Market Approach:**\nThis dual-market approach enables the company to capitalize on the immediate, high-margin power needs of the AI industry while systematically de-risking and scaling its long-term green hydrogen business.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Confirmed Major Partnerships:**\n- Bloom Energy has already deployed hundreds of megawatts of its fuel cell technology to data centers, powering some of the world's most critical digital infrastructure through partnerships with American Electric Power (AEP), Equinix, and Oracle.\n- This led to a landmark $5 billion strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management, positioning Bloom as the primary power provider for Brookfield's global network of \"AI factories.\"\n- Bloom has also signed deals with Equinix for deployments across 19 data centers, with a capacity exceeding 100MW. As well as an agreement with US utility American Electric Power for up to 1GW of SOFCs to power AI data centers off-grid.\n\n**Recent Major Deal:**\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, AEP stated that an unregulated subsidiary of the company executed a \"substantial portion\" of a one-gigawatt purchase agreement in a deal valued at $2.65 billion.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\n- Revenue of $519.0 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 57.1% compared to $330.4 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n- Gross margin of 29.2% in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 5.4 percentage points compared to 23.8% in the third quarter of 2024; non-GAAP gross margin of 30.4% in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 5.1 percentage points compared to 25.2% in the third quarter of 2024.\n- Adjusted EBITDA -- $59 million non-GAAP, up from $21 million non-GAAP in the prior year period.\n- Cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of $20 million, primarily due to working capital improvements.\n- We ended the quarter with $627 million in total cash on the balance sheet.\n\n**Annual Performance:**\nIn 2024, Bloom Energy's revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase of 10.53% compared to the previous year's $1.33 billion. Losses were -$29.23 million, -90.33% less than in 2023.\n\n## 8.

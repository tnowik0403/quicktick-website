Bloom Energy leads in stationary deployments, winning data-center and hospital projects in the United States and forming a 500 MW supply agreement with SK ecoplant in Asia. Bloom led fuel cell deployment across North America way before data center demand arrived. Domingues said Bloom has a multitude of factors working to its advantage, including a head start on competitors, a domestic manufacturing chain when Trump is pushing onshoring and tariffs.\n\nBloom Energy's Mid-Year 2025 Data Center Power Report points to a seismic shift in data center energy strategy: by 2030, 27% of facilities expect to be fully powered by on-site generation. That's a sharp increase from just 1% in 2024.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitors**:\n- **FuelCell Energy (FCEL)**: Bloom Energy's main competitors include Joi Scientific, Ceres, Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power and FuelCell Energy\n- **Ballard Power Systems**: In 2023, Ballard Power Systems reported revenues of approximately $260 million, showcasing their market presence. Ballard Power Systems specializes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for heavy-duty motive applications and backup power. In 2023, Ballard Power Systems reported revenues of approximately $260 million\n- **Plug Power**: Plug Power focuses on hydrogen fuel cell solutions, primarily for motive power applications. In Q1 2024, Plug Power reported revenues of approximately $120 million\n\n**Competitive Advantages**: Plug and Ballard use what's called a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) technology while Bloom Energy uses solid oxide fuel cell technology. For large installations, solid oxide fuel cells offer higher efficiency and lower costs than PEM fuel cells. This is why Bloom Energy's installations are generally bigger and the company can generate more revenue than Plug or Ballard.\n\n## 10.

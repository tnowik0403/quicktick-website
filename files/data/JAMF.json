(NASDAQ: JAMF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $15.92 (NASDAQ close, October 11, 2024; source: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.03B (as of October 11, 2024 close; source: Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $9.58 - $20.29  \n**Avg. Daily Volume (3 months):** 621,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nJamf Holding Corp. (JAMF) is the leading provider of Apple-centric enterprise management and security solutions, enabling IT teams to deploy, configure, protect, and manage Apple devices (iOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS) at scale. Founded in 2002 in Minneapolis, MN, and headquartered there, Jamf went public via IPO in July 2020. The company serves over 82,000 customers worldwide, including 70% of Fortune 100 companies, focusing on the rapidly growing Apple enterprise market. Its platform integrates device management (MDM), security, identity, and endpoint analytics into a unified \"Apple-first\" ecosystem. Jamf's value proposition lies in simplifying Apple's complex ecosystem for enterprises, reducing IT overhead while enhancing security amid rising cyber threats. With annual recurring revenue (ARR) as its core metric, Jamf benefits from high customer retention (128% net retention rate in recent quarters) and sticky subscriptions. The company targets the $20B+ endpoint management market, where Apple devices represent ~20-25% of enterprise endpoints but are growing faster due to remote work, BYOD trends, and Apple's enterprise push (e.g., self-service portals). Jamf's differentiation: deep Apple integration via partnerships and certifications, positioning it as indispensable for Apple-heavy orgs.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024):** Total revenue $176.9M (+9% YoY); Subscription revenue $172.5M (+10% YoY); ARR $582.4M (+11% YoY); GAAP operating loss $21.9M; Non-GAAP operating income $23.4M; Ended quarter with $209M cash.

Overall endpoint MDM: ~5-7% (Apple subset dominant).\n- **Forecast:** +2-4% annual gain through 2026 (to 60-65%) via Apple growth outpacing total endpoints (Gartner: Apple devices to 30% enterprise share by 2027). Risks: Intune erosion if Microsoft bundles aggressively.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric | JAMF | Microsoft Intune | VMware WS1 | Ivanti |\n|--------|------|-------------------|-------------|--------|\n| **Apple Focus** | Primary (100% optimized) | Secondary | Secondary | Broad |\n| **Q2 2024 Growth** | +11% ARR | +20% (Office bundle) | Flat (Broadcom cuts) | +5% |\n| **Market Share (Apple MDM)** | 55-60% | 20-25% | 10-15% | <5% |\n| **Strengths** | Apple depth, retention | Price/integration | Multi-OS | Legacy |\n| **Weaknesses** | Single-vendor | Less Apple-native | Uncertainty post-Broadcom | Fragmented |\n\n(Sources: Gartner Magic Quadrant 2024 UEM; Company filings; 451 Research.)\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships:** Apple (certified developer); AWS (Marketplace launch Q3 2024); Okta, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne (integrations); Cisco (Q2 2024 expansion).\n- **M&A:** Acquired Wandera (endpoint security, 2021, $400M); No major deals since; Focus on organic (per Q2 call).\n- **Current Major Clients:** 70% Fortune 100; Specifics: IBM (global expansion Q2 2024), Nestlé, Siemens Healthineers, Adobe, Unilever.\n- **Potential Clients:** Healthcare (e.g., post-HIPAA Apple push); Education (K-12 Apple grants); FedRAMP pursuits for gov't.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management:** CEO Sam Johnson (co-founder) strong Apple ties; CFO Focused on profitability.\n- **ESG:** High marks for privacy (Apple-aligned); Diversity initiatives.\n- **Sentiment:** Positive online (Reddit r/JAMF, Twitter: enterprise wins buzz); Analyst consensus: Moderate Buy (avg PT $23.50 from 10 analysts; sources: MarketBeat, October 11, 2024).\n- **Risks:** Currency (intl exposure); Churn in SMB.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating:** 7/10 (**Hold** with upside potential). Rationale: Solid Q2 execution, Apple tailwinds (iOS 18/Vision Pro), undervalued at 3.5x FY25 ARR (peers 5-7x). Growth reacceleration possible to 15%+ ARR in 2025, but macro IT caution caps to Hold. Moderate risk: Apple reliance offset by moat.\n- **Estimated Fair Value:** $24.00 (50% upside). DCF-based (10% discount rate, 12% 5-yr ARR CAGR, 25% terminal multiple; aligned with Barclays/JMP Securities targets). Ideal for growth portfolios seeking 20%+ annualized returns.",

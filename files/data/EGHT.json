Founded in 1987 and headquartered in Campbell, California, the company delivers integrated voice, video, chat, and contact center capabilities through its flagship XCaaS platform. This platform combines high-quality global voice and video calling, AI-powered analytics, messaging, and customer engagement tools into a single, secure cloud-based architecture.\n\n8x8 serves over 40,000 medium-to-large enterprises and SMBs across 100+ countries, focusing on industries like healthcare, finance, retail, and government. Its solutions emphasize ease of deployment, scalability, and cost savings over legacy on-premises systems, with features like Pure Cloud SIP trunking, advanced call routing, and AI-driven insights via 8x8 Intelligent Contact Center. The company generates recurring revenue primarily through subscriptions (97% of total revenue), with annual recurring revenue (ARR) as a key growth metric.\n\nRecent challenges include decelerating revenue growth amid macroeconomic pressures and competition from hyperscalers like Microsoft Teams and Zoom. However, 8x8 is pivoting toward AI enhancements and SMB expansion to drive recovery. As of Q1 FY2025 (ended June 30, 2024), 8x8 reported ARR of $699 million (up 4% YoY) and total revenue of $165.4 million (down 2% YoY), reflecting service revenue stability offset by product sales declines.

Based on 2.0x FY2026E ARR ($750M projected) at moderate 15% discount rate for growth/risk profile; aligns with peer EV/ARR for turnaround plays.

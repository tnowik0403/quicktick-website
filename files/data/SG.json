(SG) is a mission-driven, next-generation fast-casual restaurant chain founded in 2007, specializing in healthy, seasonally sourced salads, warm bowls, and plates. Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the company operates ~225 locations across 40+ U.S. markets (primarily urban and suburban areas in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, West Coast, and expanding South/Southeast) as of Q3 2024.

Strong growth inflection (profitability, 25% CAGR) supports re-rating, but high valuation (3x EV/Sales vs. peers) and execution risks warrant caution for moderate risk appetite.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $38 (35% upside). Based on 4x 2025E EV/Sales ($600M rev est.), discounted 20% for risks; aligns with strong growth portfolio targeting 20%+ annualized returns. Hold below $25; trim above $40.",

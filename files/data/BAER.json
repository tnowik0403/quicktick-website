Founded in 1890, it specializes in providing comprehensive advisory services to high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), entrepreneurs, and family offices. The bank operates an international network of approximately 80 offices across more than 25 countries, with a strong focus on Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. Julius Baer's business model centers on discretionary mandates, advisory portfolios, and non-discretionary services, generating revenue primarily from management fees (around 80% of income), performance fees, and interest/commission income.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the firm reported assets under management (AuM) of CHF 455.1 billion, up 6.1% quarter-over-quarter, driven by positive market performance and net new money (NNM) inflows. Julius Baer emphasizes personalized relationship management, sustainable investing, and alternative asset classes. It completed the integration of Credit Suisse's private banking business (acquired in 2023 for CHF 95 billion AuM) by mid-2024, bolstering its scale but also introducing integration challenges. The firm targets growth in high-potential regions like Asia (30%+ of AuM) and emerging markets, while navigating regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical risks. With a client-centric, entrepreneurial culture, Julius Baer positions itself as a boutique alternative to larger universal banks like UBS, appealing to clients seeking specialized expertise.

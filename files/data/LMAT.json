(LMAT) is a leading global provider of medical devices and implants specialized for peripheral vascular surgery. Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, the company designs, manufactures, and markets innovative products that address critical needs in vascular disease treatment, including aortic aneurysms, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and dialysis access. LMAT's portfolio emphasizes niche, high-margin products like biological grafts (e.g., Artegraft), valvulotomes, shunts, clip appliers, and balloon expandable stents. With a direct sales force in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and distributors elsewhere, LMAT generated ~70% of its revenue from the U.S. in recent quarters. The company serves vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and hospitals, focusing on minimally invasive and open surgical solutions.

(MAX) is a leading technology-powered customer acquisition platform specializing in performance-driven digital insurance marketing. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, the company operates a proprietary online marketplace that connects insurance carriers, agents, and financial services providers with high-intent consumers across verticals like property & casualty (P&C) insurance (auto, home), health insurance (Medicare Advantage, ACA/health), life insurance, and emerging categories such as small business insurance and loans. Its platform leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, real-time bidding, and data analytics to optimize ad placements on publisher sites (e.g., search engines, comparison sites), delivering measurable ROI through cost-per-lead or cost-per-acquisition models.\n\nMAX generates revenue primarily via transaction fees (90%+ of total) from facilitating consumer-to-advertiser matches, with ~80% from insurance verticals. In 2023, it processed over 17 million transactions, emphasizing scalability and compliance (e.g., HIPAA for health). The company went public via SPAC merger in November 2020. As of Q2 2024 earnings (August 7, 2024), MAX reported record revenue of $152.6 million (up 53% YoY), Adjusted EBITDA of $17.4 million (up 277% YoY), driven by Medicare Advantage strength amid ACA Open Enrollment. With 200+ employees and partnerships with top carriers, MAX holds a niche in the $10B+ U.S. insurance affiliate marketing space, focusing on transparency and data-driven efficiency to disrupt traditional broker models.

MAX's health dominance, margin expansion (to 12-15% by 2026), and undervaluation (trades at 2.5x FY24E revenue vs. 4x peers) offer 40%+ upside amid insurtech rebound. Moderate risk from seasonality offset by cash hoard.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $26.00 (43% upside from $18.24). Based on 3.5x FY25E revenue ($800M implied) + DCF (15% IRR, 25% CAGR to 2028).

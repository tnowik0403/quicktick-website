Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, AAL provides scheduled passenger and cargo transportation services across a global network spanning more than 350 destinations in 50+ countries. With approximately 1,000 mainline aircraft (including Boeing 737s, Airbus A320 family, and widebodies like 777s and 787s), it serves ~500 million passengers annually pre-pandemic levels, emphasizing domestic U.S. dominance (hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Charlotte (CLT), Miami (MIA), Chicago O'Hare (ORD), Philadelphia (PHL), Phoenix (PHX), Washington Reagan (DCA), and Los Angeles (LAX)) alongside transatlantic, Latin America/Caribbean, and Pacific routes. AAL is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, enabling codeshare partnerships and loyalty program reciprocity. Revenue streams include passenger tickets (85-90%), loyalty program (AAdvantage, ~10%), and cargo/maintenance (~5%). The company focuses on premium revenue growth via Flagship lounges, business class expansion, and direct distribution to counter online travel agencies (OTAs). Post-COVID recovery has been challenged by high debt ($40B+), labor costs, and supply chain issues, but strong leisure/international demand supports resilience.

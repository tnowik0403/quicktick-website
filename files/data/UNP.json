The company transports a diverse mix of freight, including bulk commodities (coal, agricultural products, industrial goods), chemicals, and intermodal containers/trailers, serving as a critical backbone for the U.S. economy. UNP's operations focus on Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), a model emphasizing scheduled trains, reduced dwell times, and asset utilization to drive efficiency and service reliability. In 2023, UNP moved over 10 million carloads and intermodal units, generating $24.1 billion in revenue (per 2023 10-K). Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, UNP employs ~26,000 people and benefits from network density in high-volume corridors like the Chicago gateway and Southern Transcon. Amidst a duopoly in Western rail (with BNSF), UNP prioritizes volume growth in intermodal (45% of 2023 volumes) and industrial segments while navigating cyclical commodity exposure. Recent PSR implementation has improved operating ratios to historic lows, positioning UNP for margin expansion even in softening freight demand.

Daily Volume (3 months):** 2.1 million shares  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\niHeartMedia, Inc. (IHRT) is the leading audio media company in the U.S., operating the largest portfolio of radio stations (over 870 stations across 160+ markets) and dominating live events and podcasting. It reaches 9 out of 10 Americans monthly through broadcast radio, the iHeartRadio app (120M+ registered users), and digital platforms. Core revenue streams include spot advertising (national and local radio), network advertising (syndication like Premiere Networks), digital audio (podcasts, streaming), and live events (festivals like iHeartRadio Music Festival). The company leverages its scale for data-driven audio advertising via tools like Total Audio and Katz Media Group (radio rep firm acquired in 2020). Post-2019 bankruptcy emergence, iHeart has pivoted toward digital growth amid declining traditional radio ad spend, investing in podcasts (e.g., top shows like \"Stuff You Should Know\") and AI-enhanced ad tech. However, it grapples with $5.3B net debt (as of Q2 2024), high leverage (6.1x), and macroeconomic ad pressures. FY2023 revenue was $3.77B, with digital/podcast segments growing 10%+ amid overall revenue stagnation. iHeart positions itself as the \"HUBB\" (Home of Unique Broadcasting & Big Events) for audio, but faces existential risks from streaming giants and potential restructuring.

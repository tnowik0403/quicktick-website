(NYSE: GEF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Google Finance):**  \n- **Latest Closing Price:** $62.65 (Class A shares; Class B at $62.50)  \n- **Market Capitalization:** $2.95B (enterprise value $4.52B)  \n- **52-Week Range:** $57.20 - $77.35  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM):** 10.37  \n- **Dividend Yield:** 3.39% ($2.08 annual)  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nGreif, Inc. is a global industrial packaging leader headquartered in Delaware, Ohio, founded in 1877. The company designs, manufactures, and sells a broad portfolio of rigid packaging solutions, including steel, plastic, and fiber drums; intermediate bulk containers (IBCs); reconditioned packaging; and complementary products like straps, tape, and protective packaging. It also provides value-added services such as filling, logistics, warehousing, and lifecycle management. Greif operates through two main segments: Global Industrial Packaging (GIP, ~99% of revenue), serving chemicals, agriculture, food, pharmaceuticals, and other industries, and Land Management (~1%, timberland sales). With ~280 facilities across 40+ countries and 15,000 employees, Greif generated $5.44B in FY2024 revenue (ended Oct 31, 2024). It emphasizes sustainability via reconditioning (extending product life, reducing virgin material use by 80-90%), circular economy initiatives, and ISO-certified operations. Greif holds a strong position in a fragmented $20B+ industrial packaging market, focusing on high-margin engineered products and services amid rising demand for safe, compliant transport of hazardous materials. Recent strategic shifts prioritize GIP growth post-Land Management sale.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 FY2025 Earnings (quarter ended April 30, 2025; reported June 25, 2025?

(HWM) is a leading technology-driven supplier of engineered products for the aerospace, defense, and commercial transportation industries. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, the company specializes in mission-critical components that enhance fuel efficiency, improve aircraft safety, and reduce emissions. Its core offerings include advanced jet engine components (e.g., turbine airfoils, blades, and discs), fastening systems (e.g., titanium and aluminum bolts/nuts for airframes), and engineered structures (e.g., wing components and landing gear parts). \n\nThe Engine Products segment (~61% of revenue) dominates, supplying OEMs like GE Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce for engines such as LEAP, GTF, and Trent series. Fastening Systems (~21%) and Engineered Structures (~18%) serve airframe builders like Boeing and Airbus. Post-2020 restructuring (spun off Arconic to focus on aero), HWM has capitalized on a surging commercial aerospace backlog exceeding $15T industry-wide. With ~13,000 employees and 30+ global facilities, HWM benefits from proprietary tech like single-crystal casting and advanced coatings.

Strong GLP-1 demand and generic launches offset by softer retail pharmacy volumes.\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (Reported May 8, 2024)**: Full-year revenues $308.9 billion (+11% YoY); adjusted diluted EPS $27.41 (+3%); U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues $264.4 billion (+12%).\n- **Debt Offering (September 19, 2024)**: Priced $7.1 billion in senior notes to refinance maturing debt and fund general corporate purposes, maintaining strong liquidity ($6.2 billion cash as of Q1 FY25).\n- **Oncology Network Expansion (Ongoing 2024)**: US Oncology Network added 100+ providers YTD, now serving 2.45 million patients annually.\n- **Regulatory/Policy Updates**: August 2024 DOJ settlement resolved legacy opioid litigation for $72.1 million (minor impact).\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Focus**: Expand high-margin RxTS (target 15-20% annual growth via AI-driven prior authorizations and 340B contract pharmacy services) and specialty pharma distribution (oncology, GLP-1s).\n- **Margin Expansion**: Shift to generics/biosimilars (e.g., Humira biosimilars launched July 2024) and technology-enabled services; aim for 3-4% adjusted operating margin growth.\n- **Network Leverage**: Invest $500M+ annually in distribution tech/automation; expand US Oncology Network to 50%+ of community oncology market.\n- **M&A Pipeline**: Opportunistic bolt-ons in RxTS and medical-surgical; $4B+ capacity post-debt raise.\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Tailwinds | Headwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Sector-Wide** | GLP-1 drugs (e.g., Ozempic/Wegovy) drove 20%+ U.S. Pharma growth in Q1 FY25; biosimilar launches (Humira equivalents since July 1, 2024) boost volumes; aging population increases chronic care demand. | Drug pricing reforms (Inflation Reduction Act extensions); retail pharmacy chain insolvencies (e.g., Rite Aid Chapter 11 Oct 2023 fallout lingers); generic deflation (~5-7% pressure). |\n| **Company-Specific** | RxTS +13% growth; oncology network scale. | Medical-Surgical softness (-1% Q1 FY25) from provider consolidation; opioid litigation tail (resolved but reputational). |\n\n## Products/Services Portfolio\n- **Existing**:\n  - U.S. Pharmaceutical: Generic/branded drugs, specialty (oncology, rare diseases), vaccines; 340B/OTC services.\n  - RxTS: CoverMyMeds (80%+ U.S. prior auth market share, processes 2B+ scripts/year); RxNetwork hub services.\n  - Medical-Surgical: Supplies to homecare/hospice (e.g., McKesson Medical-Surgical brand).\n- **New/Developing**:\n  - AI-powered prior auth tools (CoverMyMeds v2.0, piloted Q3 2024, full rollout FY25).\n  - Oncology platform expansions (e.g., iKnowMed EHR upgrades, Q2 2024).\n  - GLP-1 distribution hub investments (announced May 2024, operational Q4 2024).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Approximations** (U.S. Pharma Wholesale, ~$550B market; sourced from IQVIA/Statista 2024 reports):\n  | Segment | McKesson Share | Cardinal (CAH) | Cencora (COR) |\n  |---------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n  | Overall Pharma | ~23% | ~22% | ~27% |\n  | Specialty Pharma | ~25% | ~20% | ~28% |\n  | RxTS (Prior Auth) | ~80% (via CoverMyMeds) | N/A | ~10% |\n- **Forecast**: Stable to +1-2% share gain in pharma/specialty through FY2027 (per management guidance Aug 2024), driven by RxTS (15% CAGR) and oncology; overall revenue +6-8% CAGR. Potential decline in Medical-Surgical (-2-3% share) due to Amazon Pharmacy competition.\n\n## Competitors Comparison\n| Metric (FY2024/LTM) | MCK | CAH | COR |\n|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Revenue | $309B | $226B | $306B |\n| Op. Margin (Adj.) | 3.1% | 1.0% | 1.9% |\n| RxTS/Tech Revenue % | 2% (growing) | Minimal | 3% |\n| Market Cap (Oct 11) | $72B | $28B | $48B |\n| **Edge** | Scale + tech moat | Manufacturing | Provider services |\n\nMCK leads in efficiency/tech; peers face higher litigation risks.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Eli Lilly (GLP-1 direct distribution, expanded June 2024); Pfizer (oncology co-promotion); Google Cloud (AI analytics, renewed 2024).\n- **Recent M&A**:\n  - April 2024: Acquired Florida Cancer Specialists (added 100+ oncologists to USON).\n  - No major deals in H1 FY25; $2B spent YTD on smaller RxTS tuck-ins.\n- **Major Clients** (Top 10 ~40% revenue): CVS Health, Walgreens, Rite Aid remnants, HCA Healthcare, US hospitals (e.g., Kaiser); Potential: Amazon Pharmacy expansion, Novo Nordisk GLP-1 scale-up.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 8/10 (**Strong Buy** for growth upside/moderate risk). MCK offers defensive revenue stability (essential services), 10-15% EPS growth potential from RxTS/specialty tailwinds, and 20%+ upside to fair value amid GLP-1/biosimilar booms. Trading at 18x FY26 EPS (below historical 22x avg.), with low beta (0.7). Hold risk from policy changes.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $650 (20% upside from $544.50). Based on 20x FY26 adjusted EPS ($32.50 est., per consensus + mgmt guidance), DCF (7% WACC, 3% terminal growth), and peer avg multiples. Strong growth portfolio fit: 8-10% CAGR revenue, margin expansion to 3.5%.",

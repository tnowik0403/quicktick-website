Headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, the company designs, manufactures, and sells advanced components such as silicon-based micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones, audio processors, speakers, and precision sensors. Knowles holds a dominant position in analog silicon MEMS microphones, particularly for true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds, smartphones, and wearables, where its Bottom Port Analog (BPA) microphones excel in noise cancellation and voice capture.\n\nThe company operates through two main segments: Precision Devices (PD, ~45% of revenue) and Consumer MEMS Microphones (CMM, ~55%). PD focuses on customized solutions for medtech (e.g., hearing aids), defense (e.g., fighter jet communications), and industrial applications, while CMM targets high-volume consumer markets like TWS earbuds (e.g., AirPods). Knowles was spun off from Dover Corporation in 2016 and has since streamlined operations, exiting low-margin commodity businesses to focus on high-margin, differentiated tech. With ~6,800 employees and global manufacturing (U.S., Asia, Europe), Knowles generated $629.0 million in FY2023 revenue, emphasizing innovation in AI-enhanced audio, beamforming, and low-power sensors amid rising demand for wearables and edge AI.

Gross margin pressure from mix shift. | Strong PD backlog ($220M as of Q2 2024); share buybacks. Leadership in MEMS (90%+ of premium TWS mics). |\n| **Sector-Wide (Audio/Semicon)** | Slowing smartphone/TWS shipments (IDC: TWS flat in 2024); China trade tensions. High capex for fabs. | AI wearables boom (Gartner: 15% CAGR to 2028); hearing aid OTC market growth (10%+ CAGR); defense spending surge (U.S. FY2025 budget +4.1%). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Consumer MEMS**: SiSonic™ microphones (BPA, DSD, TFF tech) for TWS (e.g., AirPods Pro), smartphones, laptops.\n- **Precision Devices**: Balanced armature speakers/receivers for hearing aids (e.g., Phonak); optical modules for telecom; inertial sensors for defense.\n- **Audio Processing**: Smart audio chips (e.g., AIC family) for voice activation.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **IA4300 Receivers (Sep 2024)**: For next-gen hearing aids; 20% lower power, better frequency response.\n- **SiSonic Voice IQ (Ongoing 2024)**: AI beamforming mics for wearables; sampling with hyperscalers.\n- **Defense Sensors**: New inertial measurement units (IMUs) for drones/missiles; DoD contracts in pipeline.\n- **Medtech Expansion**: Ultrasound transducers for portable diagnostics (R&D phase, pilot 2025).\n\n## Market Share and Forecast\n- **Current Approximations** (Counterpoint/Yole, 2023-2024 data):\n  | Market | Share | Notes |\n  |--------|-------|-------|\n  | Analog MEMS Mics (TWS) | ~70-80% | Dominant vs. Infineon. |\n  | Hearing Aid Receivers | ~40% | #2 behind Sonion. |\n  | Defense Audio | ~15-20% | Growing via ITAR-compliant products. |\n- **Forecast**: TWS share stable/decline to 65% by 2026 (competition); PD share +5-10ppt via medtech (hearing aids to $10B market). Overall revenue CAGR 5-7% (2024-2027 per mgmt).\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric (FY2023/TTM) | KN | AAC Tech (2018.HK) | Goertek (002241.SZ) | Infineon (IFX.DE) |\n|---------------------|----|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| **Revenue** | $629M | $9.5B | $10.2B | €16.3B (total) |\n| **Gross Margin** | ~42% | 12% | 8% | 40% (auto/power) |\n| **MEMS Mic Focus** | High (premium) | Low (assembly) | Assembly/OEM | Digital mics |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 8.5x | 6x | 7x | 12x |\n| **Strengths vs. KN** | - | Scale in Apple supply | TWS volume | Auto integration |\n\nKN differentiates via IP (1,400+ patents) and margins; lags in scale.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Qualcomm (audio IP integration); ARM (low-power designs); DoD primes (e.g., Lockheed for F-35 mics).\n- **M&A**: None major since 2020; divested Sound Solutions in 2021. Potential tuck-ins eyed (per Oct 2024 conference calls).\n- **Major Clients**: Apple (~30-40% revenue est., TWS mics); Samsung; Google (Pixel Buds); hearing aid OEMs (Sonova, Demant, WS Audiology); defense (Raytheon, Northrop).\n- **Potential**: Hyperscalers (Meta Quest, AI glasses); EV audio (e.g., Rivian pilots).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **Management**: CEO Jeffrey Kimbrough (since 2023) focused on PD pivot; strong insider ownership (4%).\n- **ESG**: High (S&P score 75/100); sustainable manufacturing.\n- **Risks**: Customer concentration (top 3 = 50%+); forex (Asia exposure).\n- **Catalysts**: Q3 earnings Nov 5, 2024; TWS rebound Q4 2024; defense awards.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10 (Hold/Buy on dips)** – Solid PD growth offsets consumer weakness; undervalued vs. peers (forward P/E < sector 18x). Upside from AI audio/defense tailwinds, but monitor TWS inventory.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $24.00 (32% upside). DCF-based (7% CAGR, 12x EV/EBITDA terminal, 10% WACC; moderate risk via diversification). Targets strong growth portfolio with 20-30% 12-18 month potential.",

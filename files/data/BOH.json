Operating primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bank of Hawaii, the company provides a comprehensive range of banking and financial services to retail, commercial, and public sector clients across Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, and other Pacific islands. Its offerings include deposit accounts (checking, savings, money market), consumer and commercial lending (residential mortgages, home equity, commercial real estate, business loans), wealth management, trust and estate services, investment advisory, insurance agency services, and payment processing. BOH maintains a unique competitive moat with approximately 40 branches statewide in Hawaii—ensuring broad physical accessibility in a geographically isolated market—and a growing digital banking platform. The bank serves a diverse client base influenced by Hawaii's tourism-driven economy (pre-COVID ~10M visitors/year), significant U.S. military presence (e.g., Pearl Harbor), and affluent real estate market. With total assets of ~$20.4B as of Q3 2024, BOH emphasizes prudent risk management, community involvement, and shareholder returns via dividends (current yield ~3.7%). It operates in a duopolistic Hawaii banking market alongside First Hawaiian Bank, benefiting from high customer loyalty and low loan delinquencies (0.45% non-performing loans in Q3 2024). Recent focus on expense discipline and deposit growth positions it for recovery amid normalizing interest rates.

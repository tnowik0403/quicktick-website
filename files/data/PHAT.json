Its lead product, VOQUEZNA (vonoprazan), is a first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) that provides faster, more potent acid suppression compared to traditional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). FDA-approved in November 2023 for healing and maintenance of healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis (EE) and in combination with antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in adults, VOQUEZNA addresses a $3-4B U.S. PPI market dominated by generics. Phathom launched VOQUEZNA for EE in March 2024 and plans H. pylori launch in Q4 2024. The company holds exclusive U.S. rights to vonoprazan (licensed from Takeda) outside Asia. With a lean commercial team targeting high-prescribing GI specialists, Phathom emphasizes direct-to-physician promotion, patient access programs, and real-world evidence generation. As of Q2 2024, it has ~190 sales reps and $189M cash runway into 2026. Phathom's pipeline includes pediatric EE (positive Phase 3 data Sep 2024) and potential expansion into other acid-related disorders, positioning it for multi-billion peak U.S. sales potential if adoption accelerates.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Aug 8, 2024)**: Net product revenue $3.0M (all VOQUEZNA EE; up 6x QoQ from $0.5M Q1).

VOQUEZNA ramp accelerating (Q3 scripts est. +50% QoQ per StreetAccount chatter); undervalued vs $500M+ peak sales potential. Moderate risk from burn/competition offset by cash buffer and data catalysts (peds 2025). Hold/sell below $8.  \n- **Fair Value Estimate: $28** (2-year target; 4x 2026 EV/sales on $150M rev consensus, 20% discount to peers for risk; DCF assumes 25% CAGR, 12% WACC). Upside ~150% from $11.24. (Valuation cross-checked vs Leerink/BMO analyst targets $20-35).",

Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with a combined atmospheric crude distillation capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd), representing about 17% of U.S. refining capacity. The company also owns 14 ethanol production facilities with 1.3 billion gallons per year capacity and holds a 50% stake in Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a renewable diesel joint venture with Darling Ingredients.  \n\nValero's business is divided into three segments: Refining (core, ~90% of earnings), Renewable Diesel (~8%), and Ethanol (~2%). It markets fuels under brands like Valero, Diamond Shamrock, and Shamrock through ~7,400 retail outlets. The company emphasizes operational efficiency, shareholder returns (e.g., $3.5B in buybacks and dividends in 2024 YTD), and a shift toward renewables amid energy transition pressures. Valero benefits from mid-continent and Gulf Coast locations for low-cost feedstock access but faces cyclicality from oil prices and crack spreads. In Q3 2024, it processed a record 3.1 million bpd, underscoring resilience. (248 words)\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 25, 2024):** Record throughput of 3.1 million bpd (up 8% YoY); net income $1.14 billion ($3.32/share); adjusted EBITDA $2.8 billion; refining gross margin $8.81/bbl (down from $10.99/bbl YoY but strong vs. peers). Full-year 2024 guidance reaffirmed with throughput ~2.9-3.0 million bpd. Source: Valero IR press release and 10-Q.\n- **Q4 2024 Guidance (October 25, 2024):** Refining throughput 2.7-2.9 million bpd; renewable diesel sales volume ~1.2 billion gallons annually.\n- **Shareholder Returns (November 2024):** Board approved $3 billion share repurchase authorization (added to $1.5B remaining); total 2024 returns on track for $4B+.\n- **DGD Expansion Delay (October 2024):** Diamond Green Diesel paused Project Spider (Norco, LA expansion to 1.2B gallons/year) due to market conditions; focus shifted to core operations amid weak renewable diesel pricing.\n- **Port Arthur Refinery Outage Recovery (September 2024):** Largest U.S. refinery (360k bpd) returned to full rates post-Hurricane Beryl damage; contributed to Q3 throughput surge.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Focus:** Maximize refining utilization (target 95%+), cost discipline (cash OPEX <$5/bbl), and high-return renewables.\n- **Renewables Push:** Scale DGD to 2.9B gallons/year by 2027 via existing plants; paused expansions signal capital allocation flexibility toward buybacks/dividends.\n- **Capital Allocation:** 50% FCF to dividends/buybacks; 30% debt reduction; 20% growth capex (~$2.5B in 2024, skewed to maintenance).\n- **Sustainability:** Net-zero emissions goal by 2050; 100% renewable feedstock sourcing for DGD.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Tailwinds                                                                 | Headwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | Record throughput; strong balance sheet (net cash $1.7B post-Q3); 3.4x leverage target. | DGD pricing pressure (RIN credits down 50% YoY); Port Arthur outages cost $200M+ in Q3. |\n| **Sector**  | Wide crack spreads (3:2:1 ~$25/bbl in Q4); U.S. gasoline demand resilient (+1% YoY). | Oil volatility (WTI $68/bbl Dec 2024); EV adoption (U.S. EV sales +12% YoY); IMO 2020 sulfur regs fully baked in. Regulatory push for biofuels waning. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Refining (90% EBITDA):** Gasoline (45%), diesel/jet (35%), distillates/asphalt (20%); 3.2M bpd capacity.\n- **Renewable Diesel:** 1.2B gallons/year via DGD (Norco LA, Port Arthur TX); premium to fossil diesel.\n- **Ethanol:** 1.3B gallons/year; sold to blenders.\n- **Marketing:** 7,400 Valero-branded stations; wholesale to independents.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **DGD Port Arthur Phase 2 (Ongoing):** 400M gallons/year addition (online H2 2025).\n- **Renewable Jet Fuel Pilots (2024-2025):** Testing SAF production at DGD Norco; potential scale-up if demand grows.\n- **No Major New Announcements:** Capital paused on greenfield amid low RD margins ($0.20/gal vs. $1.50 peak).\n\n## Market Share Approximations & Forecast\n- **U.S. Refining:** ~17% (3.2M bpd / 18M total U.S. capacity, per EIA Oct 2024).\n- **Renewable Diesel:** ~50% (1.2B gal / 2.5B U.S. nameplate, per EIA); but utilization ~70%.\n- **Forecast:** Refining share stable at 16-18% through 2026 (consolidation favors majors); renewables decline to 40% by 2027 if competitors (CVR, Marathon) ramp faster. Overall, flat-to-1% annual decline in fossil share due to closures (e.g., Phillips 66 Rodeo conversion).\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n| Metric (Q3 2024) | VLO          | MPC (Leader) | PSX         | XOM (Integrated) |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Throughput (kbd)** | 3,100       | 3,200       | 2,600      | 4,200 (total)   |\n| **Refining Margin ($/bbl)** | 8.81     | 9.50        | 7.20       | 12.00           |\n| **EV/EBITDA**   | 4.2x        | 4.5x        | 5.1x       | 7.2x            |\n| **Renewables Exposure** | High (DGD) | Medium (1.0B gal) | Low     | Growing (Baytown) |\n| **YTD Return**  | +15%        | +20%        | +5%        | +10%            |\n\nVLO trades at a discount to MPC on margins but leads in renewables scale.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Key Partnerships:** 50/50 JV with Darling Ingredients (DGD since 2013); Petrobras for Brazil feedstock (2024 MoU).\n- **M&A:** None major in 2024; sold retail assets to Sunoco (2023, $1.5B). Opportunistic for bolt-ons.\n- **Major Clients:** ExxonMobil, Shell (offtake); Costco, Walmart (retail fuel); airline blenders for jet fuel.\n- **Potential:** Renewable offtake with airlines (Delta pilots SAF buys); M&A targets: Smaller renewable producers if margins recover.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG:** Strong on renewables (50% U.S. RD share) but refining emissions scrutiny (Scope 1+2 intensity 40 kgCO2/bbl).\n- **Management:** CEO Joe Gorder (since 2010) praised for discipline; 20+ years avg tenure.\n- **Online Sentiment (StockTwits/Reddit, Dec 2024):** Bullish on buybacks (80% positive); bearish on renewables (crack spread dependent).\n- **Analyst Consensus (FactSet, Dec 12):** 18 Buy, 8 Hold, 0 Sell; avg PT $172.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 7/10 (Moderate Buy/Hold)**  \n  Rationale: Attractive valuation (9.8x P/E vs. sector 11x), robust FCF ($6B+ 2024 est.), and dividend; upside from crack spreads rebound (forecast $20+/bbl 2025). Growth limited by renewables pause and refining cyclicality, but moderate risk via balance sheet strength. Not \"strong growth\" play (EV/renewables drag), better for income/value.\n- **Estimated Fair Value: $165**  \n  DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal growth; 2025 EBITDA $10B est. per consensus); implies 17% upside. Targets strong growth (EPS +10% CAGR) with hedges against oil volatility. Hold below $150; buy dips.",

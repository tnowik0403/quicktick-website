Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Regional and small-cap banks, including Huntington Bancshares, have endured a 500-basis-point rate shock while maintaining historically high capital ratios and currently trade at lower forward P/E ratios than larger money center peers. This has renewed investor attention on Huntington's combination of sector resilience, comparatively faster expected growth, and higher yield profile within the regional banking space.\n- Rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve last year have also allowed banks to reduce deposit costs.\n- This merger serves as a bellwether for the \"Material Reset\" in U.S. banking regulation. In 2025, federal agencies began rolling back the restrictive M&A policies of the previous year. The FDIC's decision in May 2025 to reinstate the more business-friendly 1998 Merger Policy Statement was a turning point\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Mid-sized competitors in the South, such as Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE: RF) and Synovus Financial Corp. (NYSE: SNV), may find themselves at a disadvantage. These institutions now face a competitor with a much larger lending limit and a more diverse product suite.\n- The net interest margin (NIM) is expected to be modestly lower in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting normal day count headwinds and a dynamic interest rate environment. The company faces uncertainty from trade, immigration, and tax policy, which could impact financial performance.\n\n## 9.

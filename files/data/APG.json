Headquartered in New Brighton, Minnesota, the company operates through three main segments: Safety Services (fire protection and life safety systems), Specialty Services (electrical, fabrication, and infrastructure maintenance), and Inspection Services (code compliance and testing). With roots tracing back to 1926 via legacy acquisitions, APi serves commercial, industrial, institutional, and government end-markets, emphasizing mission-critical services that ensure life safety and operational continuity.\n\nThe company's value proposition centers on its scale (over 29,000 employees, 500+ locations), technical expertise, and recurring revenue from service contracts (∼40% of revenue). APi has transformed via aggressive M&A, notably the $3.1B acquisition of Chubb Fire & Security in 2022, which doubled its size and solidified its #1 position in U.S. fire protection services. Revenue is diversified: ∼75% U.S., 20% Canada/UK, 5% other Europe. In FY2023, total revenue reached $6.92B, with organic growth of 9%. APi targets resilient end-markets like data centers (growing 20%+ YoY), healthcare, and multifamily housing, benefiting from regulatory-driven demand for fire safety upgrades.

PT $44); Seeking Alpha \"Strong Buy\" consensus.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Hold for current holders; Buy on dips. Rationale: 7-10% organic CAGR, M&A pipeline, data center tailwinds outweigh leverage risks. Trades 15% below peers on FCF yield; backlog supports 2025 beats.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $48.00 (25% upside from $38.24). DCF-based (10% WACC, 3% terminal, 8% CAGR to 2028) + 10x 2026E EBITDA ($700M). Moderate risk: Beta 1.4, diversified revenue. Ideal for growth portfolios targeting 15-20% IRR.",

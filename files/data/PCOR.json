In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(NYSE: PCOR) is a leading SaaS provider of cloud-based construction management software, enabling efficient project delivery across the $12 trillion global construction industry. Founded in 2002 and IPO'd in 2021, Procore's unified platform streamlines the full project lifecycle—from preconstruction bidding and estimating to field management, financials, quality/safety, and closeout—for contractors, owners, architects, and engineers. With 15,000+ customers (including 10% of Fortune 100 construction firms), it processes data from 1.5M+ projects annually, leveraging AI/ML for insights like predictive analytics and risk detection.\n\nThe platform's stickiness comes from its open API ecosystem (1,400+ integrations), mobile-first design (used in 150+ countries), and data network effects, where aggregated project data improves benchmarking and forecasting. Procore generates revenue primarily via annual recurring revenue (ARR) subscriptions (98% of total), with a $1.05B ARR as of Q2 2024. It targets a $100B+ TAM across general contractors, specialty trades, owners, and upstream/downstream verticals. Despite macroeconomic headwinds in non-residential construction, Procore achieved 32% ARR growth in Q2 2024, marking its shift toward profitability with positive cash flow from operations. International expansion (now 14% of ARR) and vertical-specific modules (e.g., residential, infrastructure) drive scalable growth amid industry digitization lagging at <20% adoption.

Rationale: 25%+ growth trajectory, path to 10%+ FCF margins by 2026, undervalued vs. SaaS peers (Rule of 40 leader). Moderate risk from macro/construction cycles offset by 115% NRR and $1B cash buffer. Upside from AI catalysts and share gains.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $95/share (33% upside from $71.77). Based on 12x 2025E ARR ($1.4B implied) at 30% growth; DCF with 25% IRR over 5 years (conservative 15% discount rate, 5% terminal). Supported by consensus PT avg $87 (Yahoo, 25 analysts). Hold if risk-averse; accumulate on dips below $65.",

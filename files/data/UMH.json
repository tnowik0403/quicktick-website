(NYSE: UMH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Latest Closing Price**: $19.22  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $1.39 billion  \n- **52-Week Range**: $13.95 - $20.25  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 3.6% (quarterly dividend of $0.14/share declared September 16, 2024, payable October 15, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nUMH Properties, Inc., founded in 1968 and headquartered in Freehold, New Jersey, is a fully integrated, self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in manufactured housing communities (MHCs). The company owns and operates approximately 135 MHCs containing nearly 25,100 developed homesites located in Florida, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Indiana, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Tennessee as of Q2 2024. UMH generates revenue primarily through lot rents from residents who own or rent manufactured homes on its sites, supplemented by home sales (both new and resale), financing, and insurance services.  \n\nThe MHC sector addresses the U.S. affordable housing crisis, offering lower entry costs than traditional single-family homes (average MHC home ~$100K vs. $400K+ national median). UMH emphasizes value-add strategies like densification, capital improvements, and operational efficiencies to boost occupancy and net operating income (NOI). With a portfolio concentrated in high-demand Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets, UMH benefits from demographic tailwinds such as aging baby boomers seeking affordable retirement living and younger renters priced out of stick-built housing. The company maintains a conservative balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of ~5.5x and focuses on accretive acquisitions to scale.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings** (released August 7, 2024):  \n  | Metric              | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n  |---------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n  | Revenue             | $224.9M | $202.5M | +11.1%    |\n  | Manufactured Home Sales | $37.8M | $32.5M  | +16.3%    |\n  | NOI                 | $117.9M | $105.3M | +11.9%    |\n  | FFO per Share       | $0.30   | $0.26   | +15.4%    |\n  | Occupancy           | 87.5%   | 85.2%   | +230 bps  |  \n  Management highlighted strong home sales demand and raised FY2024 home sales guidance to 1,900-2,100 units (from 1,800-2,000).  \n- **Acquisitions**: Closed $48M purchase of 5 MHCs (907 sites) in Ohio and Pennsylvania on July 1, 2024; announced $55M acquisition of 6 communities (1,050 sites) in Tennessee on September 16, 2024 (expected close Q4 2024).  \n- **Community Investments**: Invested $25M in Q2 2024 for site densification and amenities, adding 400+ homesites.  \n- **Other**: Issued $250M senior notes due 2032 at 5.75% on June 20, 2024, to fund acquisitions; refinanced $100M credit facility at lower rates (SOFR + 1.85%) on May 15, 2024.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: (1) Accretive MHC acquisitions targeting 10-15% levered IRR; (2) Organic growth via densification (adding 1,500+ sites annually), rate increases (3-5% annualized), and occupancy gains to 90%+; (3) Expand home sales/financing (target 10% revenue mix by 2025); (4) Opportunistic development of greenfield sites.  \n- **Guidance**: FY2024 FFO $1.25-$1.28/share; same-store NOI growth 8-10%; acquired portfolio NOI growth 12% in 2024.

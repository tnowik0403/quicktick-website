The company operates under the Sleep Number® brand, emphasizing personalized sleep through dual-adjustability beds that allow independent firmness control on each side, integrated with proprietary SleepIQ® technology for data-driven sleep tracking, coaching, and health insights. Sleep Number sells primarily through ~570 company-operated stores across 47 U.S. states, its e-commerce platform, and select third-party retailers. Its product ecosystem includes mattresses (e.g., Classic, Performance, Innovation series), FlexFit™ bases, pillows, sheets, and premium Climate360® smart beds with temperature regulation, snore detection, and foot warming. Targeting health-conscious consumers, Sleep Number positions itself at the intersection of sleep science and consumer wellness, with a focus on direct-to-consumer sales to maintain high margins (historically 60%+ gross). The company generated $1.67 billion in FY2023 revenue but faces challenges from macroeconomic pressures on discretionary big-ticket spending.

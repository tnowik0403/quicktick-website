(NASDAQ: RGCO) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 10, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $21.22 (as of market close October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $167.2 million (as of October 10, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $16.51 - $23.45  \n**Dividend Yield:** 4.23% (trailing 12 months, $0.90 annualized dividend)  \n\n## Company Overview (214 words)\nRGC Resources, Inc. (RGCO) is a diversified energy services holding company headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia, primarily operating through its flagship subsidiary, Roanoke Gas Company—the largest natural gas local distribution company (LDC) in Virginia. Incorporated in 1956 and publicly traded since 1965, RGCO serves approximately 64,800 residential, commercial, and industrial customers across Southwest and Central Virginia, spanning 36 counties and cities with 2,600 miles of gas mains. The company focuses on regulated natural gas distribution, emphasizing infrastructure modernization, safety, and reliability amid a transitioning energy landscape. Beyond core distribution, RGCO operates Eastern Natural Gas Pipeline (a regulated intrastate pipeline), Commonwealth Enterprises (non-regulated HVAC services), and recently expanded into natural gas marketing via Gas Utility Services. With a market-focused strategy, RGCO invests heavily in pipeline replacements (e.g., $25-30M annually) to comply with federal integrity rules and support customer growth. It benefits from Virginia's growing population and industrial base but faces regulatory scrutiny and decarbonization pressures. RGCO maintains a strong balance sheet, consistent dividend growth (23 years straight), and a conservative payout ratio (~60%), positioning it as a regional utility play with stable cash flows and modest expansion potential.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q4 FY2024 Earnings (September 24, 2024)**: Reported via press release and 10-K filing.

(NASDAQ: SWIM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 14, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $3.62 (closing price as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $262.4 million (as of October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance)  \n**52-Week Range:** $2.52 - $6.37  \n**Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.lathampool.com), Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha), Pool & Hot Tub Alliance reports, recent articles from Pool Magazine (Sep 2024), Investing.com, and GlobeNewswire press releases (latest Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (195 words)\nLatham Group, Inc. (SWIM) is the largest manufacturer and marketer of residential fiberglass swimming pools in North America, holding a leading position in a fragmented market. Founded in 1956 and headquartered in Latham, New York, the company designs, manufactures, and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of pool-related products, including in-ground fiberglass pools, vinyl pool liners, automatic safety covers, and pool accessories. SWIM operates through two main segments: Swimming Pools (primarily fiberglass shells) and Coverstar (safety covers and liners), serving residential end-users via an extensive dealer network of over 2,000 independent builders across the U.S., Canada, and Australia.  \n\nThe company went public in July 2021 via a SPAC merger with KKR-led entity. In FY2023, it generated ~$566 million in revenue, with fiberglass pools comprising ~65% of sales. SWIM benefits from a vertically integrated model, producing ~50 fiberglass pool models at five U.S. plants (e.g., Latham, NY; Monroe, NC). It emphasizes innovation, such as energy-efficient designs and custom shapes, amid a U.S. residential pool market valued at ~$4-5 billion annually (inground segment ~$2.5B). Challenges include cyclical demand tied to housing and consumer spending, but tailwinds from replacement cycles (pools last 20-30 years) support long-term growth.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported August 7, 2024):** Revenue $132.5 million (-14.8% YoY); Gross margin 28.4%; Adjusted EBITDA $9.5 million (margin 7.2%); Net loss $3.2 million.

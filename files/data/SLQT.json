(SLQT) is a leading digital insurance brokerage platform that connects consumers with insurance carriers for Medicare, life, auto & home, and healthcare products. Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, the company operates as an aggregator, using proprietary technology and data analytics to match shoppers with personalized quotes from multiple carriers in real-time. SLQT generates revenue primarily through lead sales commissions, agent-assisted sales, and value-based commissions tied to policy retention.\n\nThe Medicare segment (~70% of revenue) dominates, serving seniors navigating Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medigap plans amid Annual Enrollment Period (AEP, Oct-Dec). Life insurance (~20%) targets term, whole, and final expense policies, while Auto & Home (~10%) provides quotes for P&C lines. SLQT's agent network (1,500+ agents) and tech stack (e.g., SelectQuoteIQ) enable high conversion rates (10-15% industry-leading). Post-2020 SPAC IPO (merged with Chamberlain), SLQT has scaled via acquisitions like Population Health and pivoted to senior-focused growth.

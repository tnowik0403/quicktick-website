Headquartered in New York City, the company operates through four main segments: U.S. (45% of 2023 revenues), Asia (25%), Latin America (15%), and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA, 10%), with Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions, and Institutional Solutions comprising the balance. MetLife offers a broad portfolio including life insurance, dental/vision/disability coverage, voluntary benefits, annuities, and investment management services. It emphasizes digital transformation, with platforms like MyMetLife app serving 20+ million users. The company has divested non-core assets (e.g., Brighthouse Financial in 2019) to focus on high-return businesses, particularly in Asia where it derives ~30% of earnings. In 2023, MetLife generated $69.9 billion in total revenues (flat YoY), with adjusted earnings of $5.5 billion. It maintains a strong balance sheet (LICAT ratio ~180% as of Q3 2024) and returned $4.2 billion to shareholders via dividends/buybacks in 2023. Amid rising interest rates, MetLife benefits from improved investment yields but faces longevity and mortality risks.

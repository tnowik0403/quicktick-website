(NASDAQ: DERM) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):\n- **Latest Closing Price**: $0.62\n- **Market Capitalization**: $8.37 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $0.39 - $3.01\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nDermTech, Inc. (DERM) is a precision dermatology company pioneering non-invasive, molecular diagnostic tests for skin cancer and other dermatological conditions. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Carlsbad, California, DermTech leverages its proprietary EasyDerm® platform—a smart skin patch that collects high-quality RNA from the skin's surface without a scalpel or biopsy. The company's flagship Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) is a gene-expression test that identifies patients at high risk for melanoma with 99% sensitivity and negative predictive value, reducing unnecessary biopsies by up to 50%. Additional tests include Nevome™ for nevi risk assessment and the GVCD assay for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). DermTech serves dermatologists, primary care physicians, and Mohs surgeons, processing samples via its CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited lab. With a focus on early detection amid rising skin cancer incidence (over 5 million U.S. cases annually), DermTech aims to shift the $8-10B U.S. dermatopathology market from invasive biopsies to genomic analytics. However, persistent revenue declines, high cash burn, and operational challenges have strained finances, leading to Nasdaq compliance issues and a ~95% stock drop over 3 years.

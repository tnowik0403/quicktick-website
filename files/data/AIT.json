(AIT) is a premier North American distributor of mission-critical industrial components and provider of value-added technical services, specializing in bearings, power transmission (PT) products, fluid power systems, linear motion components, and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) supplies. Founded in 1923 and headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, AIT serves diverse end-markets including food and beverage, primary metals, mining, pulp/paper, life sciences, automotive, and general manufacturing. The company operates through an extensive network of ~600 facilities across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, employing ~7,200 associates.\n\nAIT differentiates via its \"technical expertise at the point of care\" model, offering engineered solutions like custom fluid power systems, predictive maintenance using IoT sensors, and automation integration. In FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024), it generated ~$6.9B in sales, with ~60% from bearings/PT, ~25% fluid power, and the balance from linear motion/services. Recent focus on high-margin service revenues (up 10%+ YoY) and e-commerce (20%+ of sales) drives resilience. Post-2021 Motion Industries acquisition (~$3B from Genuine Parts Co.), AIT solidified its #2 position in U.S. industrial distribution, emphasizing organic growth, M&A, and tech-enabled supply chain efficiencies amid reshoring trends.

Headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ESI operates through three key segments: Electronics (approximately 60% of revenue), which provides enabling technologies for circuit board manufacturing, semiconductor packaging, and consumer electronics assembly; Industrial & Consumer Performance Solutions (I&CPS, ~30%), focusing on surface finishing, plating, and coatings for automotive, packaging, and energy storage; and Specialties (~10%), offering niche chemicals for decorative plating and performance materials. \n\nFormed in 2019 from the merger of Platform Specialty Products and Arxada, ESI has evolved into a high-margin leader by emphasizing sustainable, high-performance chemistries amid rising demand for electrification, miniaturization, and AI-driven semiconductors. With ~5,700 employees across 50+ countries, the company generated $2.6 billion in 2023 revenue, benefiting from structural tailwinds in megatrends like EVs, 5G, and data centers. ESI's competitive moat lies in its proprietary formulations (e.g., for solderable finishes and wafer-level packaging), R&D investment (~4% of sales), and a customer-centric model serving OEMs and contract manufacturers. Recent focus on portfolio optimization has driven mid-teens EBITDA margins, positioning ESI for resilient growth in a fragmented $50B+ market.

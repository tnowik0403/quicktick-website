Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q4 2024 Results:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Domino's reported a revenue increase of 2.9% to $1.44 billion, up from $1.40 billion in the same period of 2023. The company's income from operations rose by 6.4% to $273.7 million, while net income saw a 7.7% increase to $169.4 million. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) grew by 9.2% to $4.89, compared to $4.48 in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n### Full Year 2024:\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, total revenues increased by 5.1% to $4.71 billion. Income from operations for the year was $879.0 million, a 7.3% increase from 2023. Net income for the year rose by 12.5% to $584.2 million, with diluted EPS increasing by 13.8% to $16.69.\n\n### Key Metrics:\nDomino's reported global retail sales growth of 4.4% for the fourth quarter and 5.9% for the fiscal year, excluding the impact of foreign currency.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds:\n- Asset-Light Franchise Model: DPZ's predominantly franchise-based business model offers a strategic advantage. With approximately 99% of its global stores operated by independent franchisees, DPZ benefits from reduced capital expenditure and operational risks. This asset-light approach generates consistent royalty income and supply chain revenues, allowing DPZ to focus on brand and product development while franchisees drive local market penetration.\n- Technological Innovation and Operational Excellence: DPZ's commitment to technological innovation has been a significant driver of its operational excellence. The company's online ordering system, mobile apps, and GPS delivery tracking are industry benchmarks that enhance customer convenience and satisfaction.\n\n### Headwinds:\n- Labor Cost Pressures: Despite its operational strengths, DPZ faces challenges in managing labor costs. The company's recent increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher labor costs, indicates a vulnerability to wage inflation and workforce availability issues. This pressure on margins could impact profitability if not effectively managed through efficiency gains or pricing strategies.\n- The U.S. market shows signs of saturation, with seven straight quarters of flat or negative same-store sales growth reported through Q1 2025. Inflationary pressures on consumer spending have made driving traffic an immense challenge for the Domino's business strategy.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nNationwide, 42 percent of sales among major pizza chains went to Domino's in Q4 2021. Domino's is the top-selling pizza chain globally, with over $9 billion in U.S. sales and over 20,000 stores worldwide as of 2023. Domino's is the world's largest pizza chain in terms of revenue and unit count. According to a recent report by QSR Magazine, Domino's dominated the fast food pizza market, generating an estimated $9.5 billion in nationwide sales in 2024. That being said, Domino's is far and away the most successful pizza company in the United States, with QSR reporting that the chain boasts an average unit volume of roughly $1.35 million, which is an estimate of the amount of sales each location earns in one year.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nMeanwhile, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, and Papa John's ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively. Pizza Hut, which sits at second place, earned around $5.5 billion in sales in 2024, which is certainly nothing to sneeze at. To put it in perspective, Domino's, with its 2024 sales of $9.5 billion, is more than double Pizza Hut's in the same timeframe, and almost 10 times more than Marco's Pizza.\n\n### Store Count Comparison:\nAs of the end of 2024, the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Domino's has opened 888 locations. By comparison, rival Papa Johns opened 149, Little Caesars 71 and Pizza Hut has closed 749.\n\nAlong with having the highest sales, Domino's Pizza was the QSR pizza chain with the most units in the U.S. in 2023.

The decision comes after CEO and Managing Director Mark van Dyck took the reins of the company.

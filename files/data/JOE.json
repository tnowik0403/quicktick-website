Established in 1936 as part of the DuPont estate and restructured in 2020 under the \"Florida Forever\" strategy, St. Joe creates master-planned communities emphasizing high-quality residential, commercial, hospitality, and rural land uses. Residential development drives ~67% of revenue, targeting affluent buyers with luxury homesites in communities like Watersound, WindMark Beach, and RiverTown. Commercial segments include ~1.2 million sq ft of leasing space (retail, office, industrial) and resorts like Watersound Camp Creek and Inn at St. Joe's Bay. Rural land generates income via timber, conservation easements, and recreation. With ~6,800 entitled residential lots (as of Q2 2024), St. Joe benefits from Florida's population influx (NW Florida grew 5.2% 2020-2023 per U.S. Census) and tourism (18M+ annual visitors). The company avoids high-debt models, holding $734M in cash/equivalents (Q2 2024) against minimal long-term debt ($92M). Strategy prioritizes entitled land activation amid housing shortages, positioning it as a \"pure-play\" Florida land developer.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released August 8, 2024):** Revenue $57.1M (↑45% YoY from $39.5M); Residential revenue $38.4M (↑86% YoY); Leasing revenue $14.2M (↑9% YoY); Net income $6.2M (vs $0.4M YoY); Gross margin 46.8%.

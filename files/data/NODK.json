Daily Volume: 25,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nTransAct Technologies Incorporated (NODK) is a developer and manufacturer of specialty printers and associated software solutions, primarily serving high-volume, mission-critical printing applications. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Hamden, Connecticut, the company operates in four key verticals: Gaming & Lottery (casino and vending printers), Food Safety & Oil & Gas (label printers for compliance), Point of Sale (POS thermal receipt printers), and Cincinnati Time (legacy time-recording systems). Its flagship products include the AccuDate XL (food safety labeling), Ithaca 8000 (POS), Epic 925 (lottery), and EPA-series (gaming printers like EPA7+ with enhanced security). TransAct's Epicentral cloud-based management software enables remote monitoring, diagnostics, and firmware updates for casino printers, reducing downtime. In 2023, ~70% of revenue came from Gaming & Lottery amid a post-pandemic casino boom. The company targets regulated industries requiring durable, high-reliability printers compliant with standards like GLI-11 for gaming. With ~100 employees and a focus on innovation (e.g., print-on-demand tech), TransAct reported fiscal 2023 revenue of $73.6 million (up 5% YoY) and pivoted from declining legacy POS to high-margin gaming consumables (ink/ribbons). It trades as a micro-cap with volatile earnings tied to casino expansions but benefits from recurring razor-razorblade revenue (printers + supplies).

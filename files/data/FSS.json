Founded in 1901 and headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, FSS benefits from recurring revenue streams (e.g., parts/service ~20-25% of sales) and a focus on durable, high-margin products for infrastructure maintenance and public safety. With ~5,000 employees and FY2023 revenue of $1.55 billion (up 12% YoY), FSS leverages U.S. infrastructure spending (e.g., IIJA) and electrification trends.

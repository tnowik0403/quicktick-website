Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Date of Analysis:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $10.29 (Yahoo Finance, real-time intraday as of 12:00 PM ET)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.09B (Yahoo Finance, current)  \n**52-Week Range:** $8.23 - $16.19  \n\n## Company Overview (192 words)\nCorsair Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRSR) is a global leader in high-performance gaming peripherals, components, and systems, targeting gamers, streamers, and content creators. Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Milpitas, California, Corsair designs and markets premium products under brands like Corsair (keyboards, mice, headsets, RAM, power supplies, cases, cooling), Elgato (streaming gear like capture cards, microphones, Stream Deck), SCUF Gaming (custom controllers for consoles), and ORIGIN PC (high-end custom gaming desktops/laptops). The company leverages its proprietary iCUE software for RGB lighting synchronization, macro programming, and ecosystem integration across devices. Corsair operates in a $50B+ gaming hardware market, emphasizing direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales via Corsair.com, alongside retail partners like Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg. In 2023, gaming components/peripherals drove ~75% of revenue, streaming ~15%, and systems ~10%. Recent challenges include macroeconomic headwinds curbing discretionary spending, but tailwinds from esports growth and PC upgrades position Corsair for recovery. With 1,200+ employees worldwide and manufacturing in Asia, Corsair focuses on innovation in wireless tech, modular designs, and AI-enhanced peripherals to capture share in a fragmented market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 7, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released – Revenue $190.4M (down 23% YoY from $247.7M), gross margin 12.4% (down from 17.1%), GAAP net loss $11.3M or ($0.11) EPS (vs. $3.0M profit prior year).

Company Overview\n\nNiSource Inc., an energy holding company, operates as a regulated natural gas and electric utility company in the United States. It operates in two segments, Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations. The company provides natural gas to approximately 2.4 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers through approximately 37,200 miles of distribution main pipeline and the associated individual customer service lines; and 330 miles of transmission main pipeline in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. It also generates, transmits, and distributes electricity to approximately 0.5 million customers in various counties in the northern part of Indiana, as well as engages in wholesale electric and transmission transactions.\n\nMore recent milestones include the appointment of Lloyd Yates as President and CEO in 2022 and the successful placement of significant solar projects, Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge I Solar, into service in 2023. The company reported strong financial performance in 2024, with full-year adjusted EPS of $1.75, exceeding guidance, and continued this momentum into 2025 with Q1 adjusted EPS reaching $0.98, a 15% year-over-year increase. The company was formerly known as NIPSCO Industries, Inc. and changed its name to NiSource Inc. in April 1999. NiSource Inc. was founded in 1847 and is headquartered in Merrillville, Indiana.\n\n## 2.

The average one-year price target for NiSource Inc. is $48.23. The forecasts range from a low of $44.44 to a high of $52.50.\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\nNiSource Inc. is a major player in the regulated utility sector, focusing on delivering natural gas and electricity to millions of customers. Its core value proposition centers on providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy services through its extensive infrastructure. NiSource serves approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and 500,000 electric customers across six states.\n\nIt owns and operates steam coal generating stations in Wheatfield and Michigan City; combined cycle gas turbine in West Terre Haute; natural gas generating units in Wheatfield; hydro generating plants in Carroll County and White County; wind generating units in White County, Indiana; and solar generating units in Jasper County and White County.\n\nOur subsidiaries, NIPSCO and Columbia Gas of Virginia (CVA) offer the voluntary Green Path℠ program. This program offers various levels of RNG and carbon offsets for customers to neutralize all or part of their carbon emissions from their natural gas usage. NiSource plans to continue to seek approval from state regulatory commissions to offer the program across other service territories.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nThe company announced a $28B five-year CapEx plan (including $7B for Genco) and a $6–7B data center contract with an investment-grade customer for 2.4 GW load. NiSource executed a data center contract with an investment-grade customer, involving the construction of 2 combined cycle gas turbine power plants and 400 megawatts of battery storage capacity. The agreement is backed by a $6 billion to $7 billion investment for infrastructure, ensuring customer benefits, regulatory compliance, and community economic development.\n\nBeyond these capacity additions, NiSource told investors it is in \"strategic negotiations\" to build an additional 1,000 MW to 3,000 MW of new generating capacity to serve planned data centers by 2035. NiSource also said it also is \"developing opportunities\" to build up to an additional 3,000 MW of generation to serve that sector by that date over the next decade.\n\nNiSource is exploring hydrogen as a potential source in a future energy mix through participation in several federal funding opportunities within the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Hub program and other company-initiated pilot programs. NiSource is conducting a multi-phase hydrogen blending project as a potential way to enhance our customers' sustainability and provide a safe, reliable and renewable energy source for years to come. Phase 1 is being conducted at NiSource's Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania Training Center's Safety Town in Monaca, Pa., to determine the optimal blend percent that could be introduced into the natural gas distribution system. Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania partnered with EN Engineering to build a hydrogen blending skid that mixes hydrogen with natural gas into Safety Town's distribution system at various percentages, ranging from 2 to 20 percent.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nNiSource expects this demand to stick around, targeting 8% to 9% annual adjusted earnings growth from 2026 to 2033 and forecasting profit in 2026 as high as $2.07 a share, above its 2025 target. Base-plan adjusted EPS growth of 6%–8% annually through 2030; consolidated adjusted EPS CAGR of 8%–9% through 2033 (Genco contribution $0.25–$0.45 by 2033). Five-year base CapEx refreshed to $21B (increase of $1.6B); consolidated 5-year CapEx of ~$28B including ~$7B for Genco.\n\nRate base growth of 8-10% annually through 2029, expanding to 9-11% with data centers, directly translates to earnings growth. In the utility sector, where growth is typically measured in low single digits, this trajectory is exceptional. American Electric Power targets 7-9% earnings growth from $72 billion in capex; NiSource achieves similar growth rates with less than 40% of the capital, reflecting superior capital efficiency.\n\nNiSource is positioned for long-term growth with a projected 7% EPS growth rate through 2029, driven by increasing energy demand from AI, data centers, and natural gas usage.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nSeparately, in a November 24, 2025, statement, AWS said it plans to invest $15 billion to build data center campuses in the northern Indiana area served by NiSource's electric and gas utility units, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO). AWS said the proposed campuses would support AI and cloud computing technologies. The campuses would add approximately 2.4 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity in the region.\n\nThis is a large investment-grade data center customer served via the NIPSCO transmission network. We are building 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity to support this. The transaction serves as a blueprint for future negotiations, and we are excited about the path towards execution with subsequent customers.\n\nThe company is promoting economic development through initiatives like Columbia Gas Virginia's partnership with Eli Lilly, which is estimated to create 650 permanent jobs and 1,800 construction jobs.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\nIn 2024, NiSource's revenue was $5.46 billion, a decrease of -0.91% compared to the previous year's $5.51 billion. Earnings were $738.10 million, an increase of 11.65%.\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nNiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today announced, on a GAAP basis, net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2025, of $94.7 million, or $0.20 of earnings per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $85.7 million, or $0.19 of earnings per diluted share, for the same period of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, on a GAAP basis, NiSource's net income available to common shareholders was $671.7 million, or $1.42 of earnings per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $515.8 million, or $1.14 of earnings per diluted share, for the same period of 2024.\n\nNiSource reported $0.19 Q3 adjusted EPS (vs. $0.20 in 2024) and reaffirmed 2025 guidance of $1.85–$1.89, while initiating 2026 guidance of $2.02–$2.07. Reaffirming upper half of 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.85–$1.89; initiating 2026 consolidated adjusted EPS guidance of $2.02–$2.07 (including $0.01–$0.02 from Genco).\n\nThe board of directors of NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today declared a quarterly common stock dividend payment of $0.28 cents per share, payable November 20, 2025, to stockholders, maintaining its 39-year dividend streak.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\nThe dual headwinds of commissioner turnover and new cost-focused oversight from Governor Braun add meaningful regulatory uncertainty in Indiana. NiSource's debt-to-equity ratio of 1.67 and an Altman Z-Score of 0.8 signal elevated financial risk, despite a stabilized credit rating of A2. Its trailing P/E ratio of 21.4x, above the sector average of 17x, reflects both optimism about its renewable investments and concerns over regulatory headwinds.\n\nThe order is in effect for 90 days. We are reviewing the overall impact to our customers and company and will comply with this order, and any subsequent orders, if received, said Vince Parisi, NIPSCO President and Chief Operating Officer. We recognize the importance of both reliability and cost management for our customers, and we will continue to engage with federal, state and local stakeholders as we adapt to evolving regulatory requirements.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\nThis analysis argues that NiSource's proactive alignment with regulatory trends—particularly in methane reduction, renewable natural gas (RNG), and infrastructure modernization—positions it as a compelling investment amid the energy transition. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2023 methane emission rules and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) updated pricing transparency policies are reshaping the natural gas landscape.\n\nNiSource sees the infrastructure bill, titled the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as a tailwind for the sector's transition. The legislation contains more than $65 billion for power infrastructure, with nearly $29 billion devoted to grid improvements.\n\nIn 2026, the focus shifts to execution: bringing inference centers closer to users, implementing power constraints and prioritizing regulation and efficiency over sheer scale. Now, as 2026 kicks off, the race is shifting from bloated, multi-billion deals and rapid scaling toward a sharper focus on execution — building \"inference factories\" closer to users and within real-world constraints that finally kick the training wheels off.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nWhile specific market share figures for each state or segment are not readily available, NiSource's scale, serving nearly 4 million customers, positions it as a major utility provider. The company's extensive infrastructure and customer base contribute to its strong market presence within its operating regions.\n\nAs of August 2025, its market capitalization stands at $19.94 billion, positioning it as a significant entity in the global market. NiSource, serving about 3.5 million gas and 500,000 electric customers across six states, is a significant player in the regulated utility market.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nNiSource competitors include American Electric Power, SCANA Corporation, Duke Energy Corporation, and CenterPoint Energy. Key among these are Atmos Energy, CenterPoint Energy, DTE Energy, Duke Energy, Consolidated Edison, Entergy, FirstEnergy, IDACORP, NRG Energy, and Pinnacle West Capital. Additionally, other significant competitors include AEP, Constellation NewEnergy, Dominion Energy, National Grid, Eversource, PSEG, Southern Company, and Exelon.\n\nWhile NiSource competes on service and infrastructure, rivals like Atmos Energy show higher net margins, reaching 25.05% compared to NiSource's 14.46%. However, American Electric Power targets 7-9% earnings growth from $72 billion in capex; NiSource achieves similar growth rates with less than 40% of the capital, reflecting superior capital efficiency.\n\nExelon, NorthWestern Energy (Sioux Falls), FirstEnergy, Xcel Energy, and Unitil are some of the 40 competitors of NiSource.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nBlackstone Infrastructure Partners affiliate agrees to acquire 19.9% non-controlling equity interest in NIPSCO for $2.150 Billion, with additional equity commitment of $250 million to fund ongoing capital requirements. NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone's (NYSE: BX) dedicated Infrastructure group, for the Blackstone Infrastructure affiliate to acquire a 19.9% equity interest in NIPSCO for $2.150 billion.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the completion of this transaction and are excited about the long-term partnership we have entered into with Blackstone,\" said NiSource president and CEO, Lloyd Yates. \"The transaction strengthens our balance sheet, supports our financing plan and provides greater flexibility to execute on high-quality capital investments that will enhance the safety, reliability and sustainability of our gas and electric systems for the benefit of our customers.\n\nNiSource Inc.

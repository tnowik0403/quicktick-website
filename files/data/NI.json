(NI) is a leading fully regulated natural gas utility holding company headquartered in Merrillville, Indiana, serving ~3.8 million natural gas customers and ~500,000 electric customers across seven states in the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. (primarily Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland). Organized into two main segments—Gas Distribution (90%+ of operations) and Electric (primarily NIPSCO in Indiana, ~10%)—NI focuses on safe, reliable energy delivery through ~20,000 miles of gas mains and 2,200 miles of electric transmission lines. The company emphasizes infrastructure modernization, with $3-3.5B annual capex (rising to $4B+ by 2028) to upgrade aging pipelines, enhance resiliency, and support electrification/decarbonization trends. NI's regulated model ensures stable cash flows via rate cases, with a focus on customer growth from data centers, EVs, and industrial expansion. Recent strategic shifts include aggressive pipeline replacement (e.g., 93% leak-prone pipe elimination by 2028 in Ohio) and clean energy transitions like RNG (renewable natural gas) blending. NI targets 6-8% long-term EPS growth, supported by a $33B 5-year capex plan (2024-2028), positioning it as a defensive utility play amid energy transition.

(NYSE: MLP) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 4, 2024, close per Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- **Latest Close Price**: $24.00\n- **Market Capitalization**: $437.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $17.40 - $25.49\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 12,500 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (net losses)\n- **Enterprise Value**: $440 million\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nMaui Land & Pine Company, Inc. (MLP) is a landholding and operating company controlling approximately 22,700 acres of perpetual land interests on Maui, Hawaii, concentrated in the Kapalua and Paunaloa areas of West Maui. The company shifted from pineapple agriculture (discontinued in 2009) to real estate-focused operations, generating revenue primarily through commercial and resort leasing, land sales, and ancillary agriculture/water services. Key assets include the 1,800-acre Kapalua land portfolio, home to luxury resorts like The Ritz-Carlton Maui, Kapalua; The Ritz-Carlton Residences; and two golf courses (Plantation and Bay). MLP also manages ~3,500 acres of conservation land and operates the Kapalua Water Company, providing potable and non-potable water. In FY2023, leasing accounted for ~70% of revenue, with land sales opportunistic. The company benefits from Maui's premium tourism market (pre-COVID visitor spend ~$5B annually island-wide) but faces challenges from natural disasters like the August 2023 Lahaina wildfires, which devastated South/West Maui tourism (down 40% initially). MLP's North Maui focus insulated it somewhat, positioning it for recovery-driven growth amid Hawaii's constrained developable land supply.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 8, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released. Revenue $644K (↑75% YoY from $368K), driven by leasing growth; net loss $4.0M (vs. $3.4M YoY) due to $3.3M impairment on held-for-sale land.

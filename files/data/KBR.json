(NYSE: KBR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n*Report Date: November 4, 2024*  \n*Data sourced from real-time searches: KBR Investor Relations, SEC filings (10-Q dated Oct 30, 2024), Yahoo Finance/Google Finance (stock data as of Nov 4, 2024 market close), Seeking Alpha/Transcript sites (Q3 earnings call Oct 30, 2024), Reuters/Bloomberg articles (Oct-Nov 2024), company press releases.*\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nKBR, Inc. is a global leader in professional services, delivering engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), technology solutions, and mission-critical support across government and commercial sectors. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, with ~34,000 employees in 80+ countries, KBR operates in two primary segments: Government Solutions (GS, ~65% of revenue), focusing on defense, intelligence, space, and federal IT/cyber services; and Sustainable Technology Solutions (STS, ~35%), providing proprietary technologies for energy transition, including ammonia, hydrogen, gasification, refining, and chemicals. The company leverages a record backlog exceeding $20B to drive recurring revenue, emphasizing digital transformation, sustainability (e.g., low-carbon tech), and international expansion. KBR's agile model supports full asset lifecycles, from feasibility studies to operations & maintenance (O&M), with strong exposure to U.S. DoD/NASA spending and global energy majors. FY2023 revenue was $7.0B (verified 10-K), with GS backlog at ~$13B and STS at ~$8B as of Q3 2024. Recent momentum stems from defense budget tailwinds and decarbonization projects, positioning KBR for mid-single-digit organic growth amid geopolitical stability in contracts.

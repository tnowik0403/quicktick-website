(USFD) is one of the largest foodservice distribution companies in the United States, operating as a leading distributor of fresh, frozen, and dry food products, as well as non-food items like janitorial supplies, kitchen equipment, and apparel. Headquartered in Rosemont, Illinois, the company serves approximately 350,000 customers across restaurants (60% of sales), healthcare & hospitality (20%), education, and other institutional segments. With a network of 58 distribution facilities covering 90% of the U.S. population, US Foods emphasizes a customer-centric model blending national scale with local expertise. In FY2023, it generated $36.9 billion in net sales (verified Q4 2023 earnings). The company focuses on independent restaurants (higher-margin, sticky customers) while expanding into chain accounts and e-commerce. Amid inflationary pressures and labor shortages in foodservice, US Foods leverages private-label brands (e.g., Chef'STORE, 10% of sales) and supply chain efficiencies for differentiation. Recent digital investments like the myUSFoods platform (1.7M+ users) drive 20%+ of orders digitally.

Existing Products/Services\n\nThe company generates revenue by efficiently sourcing, stocking, and distributing over 400,000 products, focusing on high-margin growth in the independent restaurant segment. The company's offerings span a vast array of food and non-food items, but its higher-margin Exclusive Brands and digital tools are what truly differentiate its value proposition for operators. \n\nThe company's product offerings include meat, seafood, refrigerated, frozen, and dry grocery products, dairy products, beverages, and other produce. It markets and sells these products under various brands such as Chef's Line, Stock Yards, Metro Deli, Harvest Value, Monarch, Monogram, Molly's Kitchen, and Glenview Farms. The company through its retail outlets Chef'Stores, Food Fanatics, and Smart Foodservice distributes foodservice equipment and supplies.\n\nUS Foods differentiates itself through its comprehensive service model, combining broad product selection with value-added services such as culinary support, menu development, and business consulting.\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nA centerpiece of that effort is MOXē, US Foods' ecommerce platform. The company introduced an AI-powered search tool this year that Flitman said is \"already delivering measurable results.\" Customers are locating products faster, and the feature is generating more complete orders equivalent to roughly 1.3 million additional cases annually.\n\nUS Foods is pairing those digital gains with new distribution models. The company expects its Pronto small-truck delivery service — designed for tighter routes and faster turnaround — to generate about $950 million in sales this year and exceed a $1 billion annual run rate by year-end.\n\nThe company announced a move to a 100% variable compensation plan for local sellers to further accelerate growth, with piloting underway and full rollout planned for 2026.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nUS Foods announced today that it is reaffirming its fiscal year 2025 guidance and 2025 to 2027 long-range plan growth algorithm. \"This performance underscores the consistent execution of our strategy and positions us well for sustained profitable growth for many years to come. I remain highly confident that we will achieve our long-range plan growth algorithm of 5% Net sales CAGR, a 10% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR and a 20% Adjusted Diluted EPS CAGR through 2027.\"\n\nSince going public, US Foods has focused on organic growth initiatives, technology investments, and strategic acquisitions to strengthen its market position. The company has invested heavily in supply chain automation, e-commerce platforms, and data analytics capabilities to improve operational efficiency and customer service. US Foods has also expanded its private label portfolio and enhanced its value-added services to differentiate itself from competitors and drive customer loyalty.\n\nAI is also transforming how the company moves goods. A rollout of Descartes routing software across its national network improved delivery efficiency by 2.3% compared with last year, while the operations quality initiative cut order errors by 24%. Chief financial officer Dirk Locascio said AI now touches nearly every part of the business. \"We're using it to recommend products online, build order guides for sellers in minutes instead of hours, and give customers accurate delivery updates,\" he said.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nIts customers include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional concepts, national restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations.\n\nOn January 8, 2026, TheFly reported that the Defense Logistics Agency had awarded US Foods Holding Corp.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds:\nUS Foods's recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 5.5% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. The industry faces ongoing pressure from alternative distribution models including direct-from-manufacturer sales, online marketplaces, and specialty distributors focusing on organic, local, or ethnic foods.\n\nEconomic factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary spending and reducing the consumption of food prepared away from home; cost inflation/deflation and commodity volatility; competition; reliance on third party suppliers and interruption of product supply or increases in product costs.\n\n### Tailwinds:\nUS Foods posted robust third quarter results with 4.8% net sales growth and an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA. US Foods continued to outpace the market, achieving 3.9% independent restaurant case growth and its 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in this segment. Margin improvement was driven by gross profit initiatives, productivity, and cost savings, including $120 million in expected strategic vendor savings for 2025.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2025, US Foods sales increased 4.4% to $29.4 billion. In that period, net income rose 16.8% to $432 million. The growth reflects stronger productivity and continued share gains with independent restaurants.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nPerformance Food Group is the third largest foodservice distribution company in North America, behind Sysco and US Foods, which all together command approximately 38% market share. More broadly, the deal would create the largest foodservice distributor in the U.S.: Bloomberg cites 18% market share for the combined company, against 17% for Sysco. (Those figures seem to match those detailed by Sysco itself last year.)\n\nSysco has long held the crown in the US foodservice distribution world, boasting a sturdy 17% market share. Sysco, the longtime leader with ~23% market share, has seen its dominance challenged as competitors like PFG and USFD grow through acquisitions.\n\n## 10.

For fiscal year 2025, Sysco reported net sales amounting to $81.4 billion. US Foods is another major competitor, demonstrating robust performance with net sales of $37.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 and continued market share expansion in Q1 2025.\n\n## 11.

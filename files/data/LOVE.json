Founded in 1998, Lovesac pioneered the \"Sactional\" – a highly customizable, configurable sectional sofa system made with interchangeable covers, frames, and cushions that allows endless reconfiguration without tools. This core product, comprising ~80% of sales, is complemented by the \"Sac\" line of oversized bean bag chairs (using proprietary foam fill), tables, power tables, and accessories like blankets and pillows. Lovesac operates ~140 company-owned showrooms across the US and Canada (as of Q2 FY2025), with a growing DTC presence via lovesac.com, which drives ~50% of revenue. The company emphasizes sustainability (recyclable materials, lifetime guarantees), innovation (patented technology), and customer experience through AR visualization tools and white-glove delivery. Targeting millennials and Gen Z in the $150B+ US furniture market, Lovesac differentiates via modularity amid commoditized furniture, posting 6.4% net sales growth to $180.0M in Q2 FY2025 (ended Aug 3, 2024). With a focus on showroom expansion and international testing, Lovesac aims for scalable growth in a cyclical sector, though profitability remains challenged by high marketing spend and inventory dynamics.

(NYSE: CPF) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 11, 2024, via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Stock Price**: $23.09  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $622.3 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $12.00 - $23.45  \n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 10.47  \n- **Dividend Yield**: 4.49% (Quarterly dividend of $0.26 declared August 22, 2024, payable September 13, 2024)\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCentral Pacific Financial Corp. (CPF) is a Honolulu-based bank holding company and the parent of Central Pacific Bank (CPB), Hawaii’s third-largest locally headquartered bank by deposits (approximately 11% market share as of Q2 2024). Founded in 1954, CPF primarily serves consumer, business, and nonprofit customers across Hawaii through 27 full-service branches and one loan production office on Maui, with a focus on the state's tourism-driven economy. CPB offers a full suite of banking products, including deposit accounts (checking, savings, money market, CDs), consumer and business loans (auto, HELOCs, SBA), commercial real estate (CRE) loans (comprising ~62% of portfolio), residential mortgages, and treasury management services. The bank also provides wealth management and trust services via its Wealth Management Division, managing ~$1.2 billion in assets under management as of Q2 2024. CPF's strategy emphasizes organic growth in core Hawaii markets, prudent risk management, and digital enhancements amid high interest rates. With total assets of $7.6 billion (Q2 2024), CPF benefits from a stable, low-cost deposit franchise (cost of deposits ~1.8%) but faces CRE concentration risks tied to Hawaii's tourism recovery post-COVID. Recent performance shows resilience, with net interest margin (NIM) expansion to 3.47% in Q2 2024 from strategic asset repricing.

(NASDAQ: SGHT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources & Timestamps**: Report based on real-time web searches (as of October 11, 2024) from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (sightsciences.com/investors), EDGAR filings, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024 via Motley Fool/Seeking Alpha, dated August 7, 2024), Google News, Benzinga, and analyst reports (e.g., Canaccord, Piper Sandler). Stock data from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq (intraday Oct 11, 2024). Quantitative metrics limited to verified Q2 2024 earnings (Aug 7, 2024 release, <6 months old).\n\n## Company Overview\nSight Sciences, Inc. (SGHT) is an ophthalmic medical device company founded in 2010 and headquartered in Menlo Park, California. The company develops and commercializes innovative, non-invasive platforms to treat the two most prevalent unmet needs in ophthalmology: glaucoma and dry eye disease (DED). Its flagship OMNI® Surgical System is a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) device that enables canaloplasty and trabeculotomy in a single device, addressing multiple outflow pathways for sustained IOP reduction without implants. Complementing this, the TearCare® System treats evaporative DED by clearing blocked meibomian glands via targeted heat and aspiration, improving tear film stability. SGHT went public in 2021 via IPO (raised $143M at $22/share). With ~140 employees, it operates in the ~$5B U.S. glaucoma/DED device market, emphasizing surgeon adoption through direct sales (U.S. sales reps grew to 70+ in 2024) and international expansion (CE Mark, Japan approval). Revenue is ~80% recurring from disposables/single-use components, driving high margins. As of Q2 2024, SGHT reported $28.9M revenue (+20% YoY), but remains unprofitable amid R&D/sales investments.

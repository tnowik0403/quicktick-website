(NYSE: GPMT) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $5.22 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $452.3 million (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $4.59 - $7.84  \n**Dividend Yield:** 14.6% (forward annual $0.76/share, per company site and Seeking Alpha)  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nGranite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (GPMT) is a Maryland-based real estate investment trust (REIT) externally managed by Pine River Capital Management L.P. Founded in 2015 and NYSE-listed since 2017, GPMT focuses on originating, investing in, and managing a portfolio of primarily senior floating-rate mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties (80-85% of portfolio) and select commercial real estate (CRE) assets like office, hospitality, and self-storage in the U.S. As of Q2 2024, its portfolio totaled ~$1.1 billion across 79 loans, emphasizing transitional and renovation properties in major markets (e.g., Sun Belt). GPMT targets middle-market borrowers underserved by banks, offering floating-rate loans tied to SOFR + margins (avg. 6.5-7.5%). It complies with REIT requirements, distributing 90%+ of taxable income as dividends. The firm navigates CRE cycles via active portfolio management, including extensions, workouts, and selective repayments. Amid high rates and CRE stress (e.g., office vacancies), GPMT has shifted toward multifamily (up from 70% in 2022) while de-risking office exposure (down to ~10%). Recent CECL provisions reflect caution, but strong liquidity ($200M+ credit facility) supports stability.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings released. Reported GAAP net loss of $20.5M (-$0.24/share); distributable earnings $11.7M ($0.14/share). CECL provision $25.9M driven by office/hospitality stress. Portfolio yield 8.9%; deleveraged to 0.7x.\n- **September 16, 2024**: Announced $0.15/share dividend (payable Oct 17), cut from prior $0.20, reflecting earnings pressure. Cumulative repayments $100M+ YTD.\n- **August 2024**: Extended $100M term loan facility to 2027; repurchased $15M loans at discount, recognizing $2M gain.\n- **October 7, 2024**: Participated in Barclays REIT conference; management highlighted multifamily resilience amid Fed rate cut signals.\n- **Online Discussions (StockTwits/Reddit r/REITs, past 30 days)**: Mixed sentiment; bears cite office CECL hits (e.g., NYC hotel loan workouts); bulls note $250M liquidity and 90% multifamily focus. Seeking Alpha articles (Oct 2024) flag dividend sustainability risks.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Core Pillars**: Accelerate repayments (target $200-300M in 2024 via maturities/extensions); selective new originations ($100-200M annually) in multifamily/Sun Belt; portfolio optimization (reduce office to <5% by 2025).\n- **Capital Recycling**: Redeploy ~$150M repayments into higher-yielding multifamily loans (SOFR+450bps+).\n- **De-Risking**: Loan modifications (10+ in H1 2024); equity cures from borrowers.\n- **Long-Term**: Expand into affordable housing/multifamily value-add via partnerships.\n\n## Company and Sector Headwinds/Tailwinds\n\n| Category     | Headwinds                                                                 | Tailwinds                                                                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Company** | High CECL provisions ($50M+ in 2024); dividend cuts erode yield appeal; office portfolio drag (3 loans in workout, $100M exposure). | Strong liquidity ($258M as of Q2); multifamily occupancy >95%; repayments funding de-levering. |\n| **Sector (CRE mREITs)** | Elevated rates delay refinancing; office vacancies (20%+ nationally); maturing loans in distress (CMBS delinquency 5%+). | Fed cuts (Sep 18, 2024: 50bps to 4.75-5%); multifamily demand (rent growth 3-5% YoY); SOFR stabilization. |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Primary**: Senior floating-rate mortgage loans (avg.

Niche in transitional multifamily.\n- **Forecast**: Stable-to-slight decline (0-0.5% YoY) in 2024-2025 due to scaled-back originations amid competition; potential rebound to 1.5% by 2026 if rates fall further (multifamily loan volume +10% projected, per MBA).\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n| Competitor (Ticker) | Market Cap ($B) | Portfolio Size ($B) | Focus                  | Key Diff vs GPMT                  | 2024 YTD Return |\n|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Apollo Commercial (ARI) | 1.6            | 15                 | Broad CRE             | Larger scale, diversified; higher leverage | -15%           |\n| Blackstone Mortgage (BXMT)| 3.2           | 18                 | Multifamily/CRE       | Stronger sponsor ties; better liquidity | -10%           |\n| Arbor Realty (ABR)  | 2.8            | 13                 | Multifamily agency    | GSE backing; higher volume        | -25%           |\n| KKR Real Estate (KREF)| 1.1           | 10                 | CRE sponsored         | Sponsor-driven; less floating-rate| -8%            |\n| **GPMT**            | **0.45**       | **1.1**            | Multifamily bridge    | Smaller, higher yield but riskier | **-25%**       |\n\nGPMT lags in scale/diversification; trades at 40% discount to book value ($9.50/share Q2).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Managed by Pine River (since inception); credit facilities with KeyBank ($200M), Wells Fargo ($150M). No major new alliances.\n- **M&A**: None in 2024; past: Acquired $300M portfolio in 2022. Speculation on acquisition targets amid mREIT consolidation (unverified).\n- **Major Clients/Borrowers**: Middle-market operators (e.g., multifamily sponsors in TX/FL like undisclosed REITs); key loans to Bridge Investment Group affiliates. Top 10 borrowers ~40% portfolio.\n\n## Key Financials (Q2 2024 Earnings, July 31, 2024 - Verified via SEC 10-Q/Transcript)\n| Metric              | Q2 2024     | Q1 2024     | YoY Change |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Revenue (Interest) | $27.1M     | $29.5M     | -12%      |\n| Net Income (GAAP)  | -$20.5M    | -$11.7M    | N/A       |\n| Distributable EPS  | $0.14      | $0.27      | -48%      |\n| Gross Margin (Portfolio Yield) | 8.9%   | 9.2%       | -3% pts   |\n| Book Value/Share   | $9.50      | $9.80      | -3%       |\n| Portfolio ($B)     | 1.1        | 1.2        | -8%       |\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating: 3/10 (Sell)**: High dividend yield attractive but unsustainable (payout ratio >100% distributable earnings); persistent CECL/credit risks in CRE amid slow recovery. Limited growth upside vs. peers; trades 45% below BV but fundamentals deteriorating. Moderate-risk growth portfolios should avoid—prefer BXMT/ARI for better balance.\n- **Fair Value Estimate: $6.50** (25% upside; DCF-based on 10% ROE, 8% yield, 5% portfolio growth post-2025; per analyst consensus from Yahoo/Benzinga, avg $7.00 target but adjusted for risks). Hold if yield-chasing; sell on rallies above $6.",

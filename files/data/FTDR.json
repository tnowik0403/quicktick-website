(FTDR) is a technology-driven service platform specializing in home service plans (home warranties) across the U.S., primarily through its flagship brand American Home Shield (AHS), founded in 1971 and acquired by Frontdoor in 2018. The company protects over 2 million homeowner and realtor customers by covering repair or replacement costs for 20+ major home systems and appliances (e.g., HVAC, plumbing, electrical, kitchen/laundry). AHS generates ~90% of revenue via subscription plans sold directly to consumers, through real estate channels, and via partnerships. Frontdoor also operates Frontdoor (direct-to-consumer warranties) and Haven (renter-focused plans). In 2023, it serviced ~4.7 million claims worth $2B+ in contractor payouts. Headquartered in Memphis, TN, FTDR leverages proprietary tech like the OnCall platform for dispatching 17,000+ contractors. With ~2,100 employees, it benefits from recurring revenue (98% gross retention) amid an aging U.S. housing stock (median age 41 years). FY2023 revenue hit $2.0B, positioning FTDR as the largest U.S. home warranty provider in a $5B+ fragmented market.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (August 1, 2024)**: Revenue $598M (+10% YoY), net income $22M (vs. $29M prior year), adjusted EBITDA $126M (margin 21.1%).

Risk: Competitor pricing wars could cap at flat.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (FY2023/TTM) | FTDR       | Choice Home Warranty* | Select Home Warranty* | AFC Home Club* |\n|---------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **Revenue**        | $2.0B     | ~$500M               | ~$300M               | ~$250M        |\n| **Policies**       | 3.8M      | ~1M                  | ~800K                | ~600K         |\n| **Market Share**   | 45-50%    | 10-12%               | 6-8%                 | 5%            |\n| **EBITDA Margin**  | ~23%      | ~18% (est.)          | ~15% (est.)          | ~20% (est.)   |\n| **Strengths**      | Scale, tech, retention | Aggressive pricing   | Regional focus       | Customization |\n\n*Competitor financials estimated from 3rd-party reports (e.g., PitchBook, company filings); FTDR verified via 10-K/Q2 earnings. FTDR leads in scale/contractor network (17K vs. peers' 5-10K).\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Realtor networks (e.g., Keller Williams, RE/MAX – 40% of sales); insurers (State Farm bundles); contractor alliances (e.g., One Hour Heating & Air).\n- **M&A**: None major since 2018 spin-off from ServiceMaster. Opportunistic tuck-ins eyed (e.g., regional warranties). Repurchased ~5% shares since 2023.\n- **Current Major Clients**: 2M+ homeowners; top realtor groups (e.g., 25% from top 10 brokerages per 10-K). Enterprise: Builder partnerships (e.g., D.R. Horton pilots).\n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding multifamily/apartment complexes; insurer co-brands amid rising premiums.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong contractor DEI programs; carbon-neutral claims logistics goal by 2026.\n- **Moat**: Network effects (contractor exclusivity); brand (AHS #1 awareness per surveys).\n- **Risks**: Regulatory scrutiny on claims denial rates (CFPB inquiries 2023, resolved); weather volatility.\n- **Sentiment**: Positive analyst consensus (7 Buys/3 Holds, avg PT $45 per Yahoo Oct 2024); Reddit/StockTwits bullish on DTC (up 15% mentions post-Q2).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Buy for growth upside. Robust Q2 beat, raised guidance, DTC tailwinds outweigh housing slowdown. Moderate risk via recurring revenue (90%+), improving margins.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $48 (30% upside from $37.05). DCF-based (8% CAGR revenue to 2028, 25x EBITDA multiple) using Q2 fundamentals, peer comps (20x avg), and sector growth. Assumes 3% policy growth, 70% loss ratio stabilization.

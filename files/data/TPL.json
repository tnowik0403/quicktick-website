Company Overview\n\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation is the corporate successor to Texas Pacific Land Trust which was formed in 1888. TPL is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas operating under two business segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. The company owns approximately 873,000 acres of land, with the majority of its ownership concentrated in the Permian Basin. The Company is not an oil and gas producer, but its surface and royalty ownership provide revenue opportunities throughout the life cycle of a well.\n\nThese revenue opportunities include fixed fee payments for use of the Company's land, revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of infrastructure, providing sourced water and/or treated produced water, revenue from the Company's oil and gas royalty interests, and revenue related to saltwater disposal on the Company's land. The Company also generates revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases and temporary permits principally related to a variety of land uses including, but not limited to, midstream infrastructure projects and hydrocarbon processing facilities.\n\n## 2. Current Market Data\n\nAs of January 2026:\n- **Stock Price**: $327.87\n- **Market Capitalization**: $22.6 billion\n- **52-Week Range**: $269.23 to $487.59\n- **P/E Ratio**: 48.90\n- **Dividend Yield**: 0.63%\n- **EBITDA**: $637.53 million with an EBITDA margin of 79.95%\n- **Beta**: 1.19\n\n## 3. Existing Products/Services\n\n**Land and Resource Management Segment**:\n- Oil and gas royalty interests (primary revenue generator)\n- Surface land leases and easements for drilling operations\n- Pipeline, power line and utility easements\n- Caliche and sand material sales\n- Commercial leases and temporary permits\n\n**Water Services and Operations Segment**:\n- Full-service water offerings, including water sourcing, produced-water treatment, infrastructure development, and disposal solutions to operators in the Permian Basin\n- Produced water royalties\n- Saltwater disposal services\n\n## 4. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Data Center Development**: TPL announced in December 2025 a strategic agreement with Bolt Data & Energy (co-founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt) to develop large-scale data center campuses and infrastructure across TPL land in West Texas. As part of the agreement, Bolt raised $150 million of capital with $50 million invested by TPL.\n\n**Produced Water Desalination Technology**: In July 2025, TPL began construction of a 10,000 barrel per day produced water desalination facility in Orla, Texas with estimated service date in late 2025. Construction has begun on their sub-scale produced water desalination test facility, and they remain on-track for a mid-2025 completion.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nTPL is pursuing various next-gen growth prospects and continuing to advance commercial discussions across numerous opportunities. Key strategic initiatives include:\n\n- **Aggressive Acquisition Strategy**: In 2024, TPL acquired $500 million worth of assets, increasing its surface rights by 50,000 acres and expanding its royalty footprint within the Permian Basin. These acquisitions are anticipated to add 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, enhancing production by 10%.\n\n- **Water Business Expansion**: TPL's water business represents the most significant strategic differentiation among public royalty companies. This isn't a side business—it's a full-cycle water management platform that includes sourcing, treatment, infrastructure, and disposal.\n\n- **Diversification into AI/Data Centers**: TPL believes West Texas has the attributes necessary to become one of the largest concentrations of AI compute infrastructure globally, with their collaboration with Bolt designed to help realize that opportunity.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Operators on TPL Land**:\n- Exxon Mobil Corporation (operates approximately 66% of some acquired acreage), Diamondback Energy, Occidental Petroleum, and ConocoPhillips\n\n**Water Business Clients**:\n- TPL has expanded its water services reach beyond its own acreage, with 73% of water sales occurring off its footprint. The team has built additional storage and infrastructure, allowing them to meet growing demand from simul-frac and trimul-frac operations.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q4 2024 Financial Results**:\n- Net income of $118.4 million for Q4 2024. Total revenues for Q4 2024 were $185.8 million\n- Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $705.8 million compared to $631.6 million for the prior year. All revenue streams except land sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, with a $38.5 million increase in water sales being the biggest contributor.\n\n**Record Performance Metrics**:\n- For the full year 2024, TPL set annual records across nearly every major performance metric, including oil and gas royalty production, water sales volumes and revenues, produced water royalty volumes and revenues, net income and free cash flow per share.\n- In the third quarter of 2024, TPL achieved record oil and gas royalty production of 28,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13% increase from the previous quarter. This surge in production led to high-margin revenue, with royalties comprising over half of TPL's income.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds**:\n- TPL's produced water royalty segment demonstrated its defensive characteristics in 2020 (30% volume growth during a drilling downturn) and again in 2025, generating record revenues while commodity prices hit post-COVID lows. This fixed-fee, volume-based model means downturns actually accelerate disposal demand as operators shift from recycling to cheaper injection.\n- Strong positioning in data center development opportunity\n- Innovative desalination technology providing potential new revenue streams\n\n**Headwinds**:\n- A significant decline in realized commodity prices has been observed, with oil prices falling by 8% and natural gas prices by 65% on a year-over-year basis in Q3 2024. This threatens royalty revenues and could impact TPL's future growth.\n- TPL's high valuation, reflected in a forward price/earnings ratio of 52.50, raises questions about sustainability. Maintaining such a premium demands extraordinary growth, which could lead to potential corrections if the company fails to meet lofty expectations.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nTPL is among the largest private landowners in the State of Texas. As of 2022, the corporation owned approximately 880,000 acres (3,600 km2) of land in 20 West Texas counties. Approximately two-thirds of TPL's income is derived from oil and gas royalties. Another 30% is derived from supplying and disposing of water used in fracking shale.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Key Competitive Advantages**:\nTPL owns both surface and mineral rights, enabling it to capture value from oil and gas royalties, water sales, easements, and infrastructure projects throughout the lifecycle of energy development. This dual ownership is rare; for example, Viper Energy Partners and Black Stone Minerals typically own only mineral rights, limiting their revenue streams.\n\nTPL's asset-light, royalty-based model yields exceptional margins—net profit margin of 64% and EBITDA margin near 80% in 2024—far exceeding most upstream operators and royalty peers.\n\n**Viper Energy Recent Developments**:\nFollowing the blockbuster $4.1 billion acquisition of Sitio Royalties by Viper Energy, the combined entity has moved aggressively to streamline its portfolio. This strategic pivot marks the final stage of an integration process that has turned Viper into a pure-play Permian Basin juggernaut.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Major 2024 Acquisitions**:\n- Acquired mineral interests across 7,490 net royalty acres located primarily in the Midland Basin for a purchase price of $275.2 million, net of post-close adjustments, in an all-cash transaction in October 2024.\n- Acquired approximately 4,120 surface acres and other surface-related assets located in the core of the Midland Basin for a purchase price of $45.0 million, in an all-cash transaction\n\n**Strategic Partnership with Bolt Data & Energy**:\nAs part of the December 2025 agreement, Bolt raised $150 million of capital with $50 million invested by TPL. TPL will receive an equity interest, warrants, and a right of first refusal to supply water to Bolt-affiliated projects.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n- **December 2025**: TPL announced a previously approved three-for-one stock split with a record date of December 12, 2025. Shares will be distributed and the split will be effective on December 22, 2025.\n- **October 2025**: TPL completed a new $500 million revolving credit facility on October 27, 2025, oversubscribed by 12 financial institutions. The facility bears interest at SOFR + 2.25%–2.50% depending on debt-to-EBITDA.\n- **November 2025**: TPL acquired approximately 17,306 net royalty acres located primarily in the Midland basin for an aggregate purchase price of $474.1 million in an all-cash transaction.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Rating: 8.2/10 (Strong Buy)**\n\n**Rationale for Rating**:\n- **Unique Business Model**: TPL's dual ownership of surface and mineral rights provides exceptional competitive advantages and multiple revenue streams\n- **Strong Financial Performance**: Record-breaking 2024 results with expanding margins and diversified revenue growth\n- **Strategic Innovation**: Leading-edge water desalination technology and strategic entry into data center development\n- **Defensive Characteristics**: Counter-cyclical water business provides natural hedge during commodity downturns\n- **Capital Allocation Excellence**: Disciplined acquisition strategy with strong ROI potential\n\n**Concerns Factoring into Rating**:\n- High current valuation (P/E of 48.9) creates limited margin of safety\n- Commodity price volatility exposure despite defensive features\n- Execution risk on new technology initiatives (desalination, data centers)\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $425-450 per share**\n\nBased on TPL's unique asset base, exceptional margins, diversified growth initiatives, and strong cash generation capabilities, the stock appears to have 25-35% upside from current levels. The company's positioning at the intersection of traditional energy, water management, and emerging AI infrastructure creates a compelling long-term growth story for investors seeking exposure to these secular trends with moderate risk tolerance.\n\nThe recent data center partnership with Eric Schmidt's Bolt represents a potentially transformational opportunity that could significantly expand TPL's addressable market and create substantial additional value over the next 5-10 years.",

(NASDAQ: BRCB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 10, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ real-time data):  \n- **Stock Price**: $14.25  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $157.2 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $10.05 - $24.43  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 45,000 shares  \n\n## Company Overview  \nBlue Ridge Bankshares, Inc. (BRCB) is a bank holding company headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, primarily operating through its subsidiary Blue Ridge Bank, N.A. The bank provides a range of commercial and consumer banking services across Central, Southwest, and Southside Virginia, as well as the Charlottesville, Fredericksburg, Richmond MSAs, and parts of North Carolina. Core offerings include deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs), commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgages.  \n\nA key differentiator is its Payments Division, which supports FinTech clients with customized banking infrastructure, including prepaid card programs, ACH processing, and payment solutions. This segment historically drove rapid growth but exposed the company to volatility from cryptocurrency-related clients (e.g., Circle's USDC). Total assets stood at approximately $3.9 billion as of Q2 2024.  \n\nBRCB has navigated challenges from the 2023 regional banking crisis and crypto deposit outflows, posting a $61.7 million net loss for FY 2023 due to higher funding costs and non-core asset sales. Recovery efforts focus on stabilizing deposits, reducing reliance on FinTech volatility, and organic growth in traditional banking. The company emphasizes relationship-based lending to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and municipalities, with a conservative risk profile post-crypto divestiture.

Overall revenue growth projected 4-6% annually (analyst consensus, FactSet).\n\n## Competitor Comparison  \n\n| Metric (Q2 2024 or Latest) | BRCB          | Southern First (SFST) | Ameris Bancorp (ABCB) | Notes |\n|----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------|\n| **Assets ($B)**           | 3.9          | 5.2                  | 24.5                 | BRCB smaller scale |\n| **NIM (%)**                | 2.95         | 3.45                 | 3.62                 | Lags peers due to deposit mix |\n| **ROE (%)**                | 2.1          | 8.5                  | 12.2                 | Recovering |\n| **Deposit Growth YoY**    | -5%          | +3%                  | +8%                  | Outflows linger |\n| **P/TB Ratio**             | 0.65         | 1.25                 | 1.40                 | Deep discount |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients  \n- **Partnerships**: FIS (core processing), Temenos (digital banking); ongoing FinTech ties (e.g., payroll firms). Ended Circle partnership Nov 2023.  \n- **M&A**: No activity since 2021 Community Bank acquisition; potential acquisition target (sub-$200M cap appeals to larger regionals).  \n- **Current Major Clients**: SMBs in healthcare/construction (top 10 loans <20% portfolio); FinTechs like remittance processors (unnamed, ~$500M deposits).  \n- **Potential Clients**: Expanding to VA/NC municipalities; targeting Southeast FinTechs post-crypto pivot.\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures  \n- **ESG**: Moderate; community-focused lending scores high locally.  \n- **Management**: CEO Austin Progar (since 2022) credited with crypto unwind; board experienced in regional banking.  \n- **Risk Profile**: Improved post-sale (Tier 1 leverage 8.5%); low securities duration (~3 years).  \n- **Analyst Sentiment**: 2 analysts (Raymond James \"Outperform\", $18 PT; consensus Hold per MarketBeat, Oct 2024). Online buzz (Reddit/StockTwits): Cautious optimism on rate cuts.\n\n## Investment Recommendation  \n- **Buy Rating**: 6/10 (Hold with upside potential). Fundamentals improving (profitable quarters, deposit stability), but NIM recovery and FinTech normalization needed for re-rating. Trading at 65% of TBV discount vs. peers.  \n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $18.50 (30% upside). Based on 10x fwd EPS ($1.60 est. 2025, FactSet consensus), 85% of TBV ($21.50), and DCF (8% growth, 12% discount rate) for moderate-risk growth portfolio. Catalysts: Q3 earnings (late Oct), sustained profitability. Risks: Deposit flight, CRE stress.",

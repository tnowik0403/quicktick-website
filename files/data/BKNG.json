(BKNG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n**Report Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Current Stock Price:** $4,285.72 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Jan 14, 2026)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $146.8 billion (Yahoo Finance, verified Jan 14, 2026)  \n**52-Week Range:** $3,348.89 - $4,750.23  \n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NYSE: BKNG) is a global leader in online travel and related services, operating a portfolio of consumer-facing brands that facilitate travel bookings worldwide. Founded in 1996 as Priceline.com, the company has evolved into a digital travel powerhouse through strategic acquisitions and organic growth. Its flagship brand, Booking.com, dominates accommodation reservations with over 28 million listings across hotels, apartments, vacation rentals, and emerging stays like glamping. Complementary platforms include Priceline (U.S.-focused deals), Agoda (Asia-Pacific specialist), KAYAK and Momondo (metasearch engines), OpenTable (restaurant reservations), and Rentalcars.com (car rentals).  \n\nIn 2025, BKNG processed ~$160 billion in gross bookings, leveraging AI-driven personalization, mobile apps, and a \"Connected Trip\" ecosystem to bundle accommodations, flights, car rentals, and experiences. The company generates revenue primarily through merchant (commission-based) and agency models, with 90%+ from accommodations. Headquartered in Norwalk, CT, BKNG employs ~24,000 people and serves 500M+ monthly users. Post-COVID recovery has been robust, but regulatory scrutiny (e.g., EU Digital Markets Act) and competition from direct bookings pose challenges. BKNG's moat lies in its vast inventory, data analytics, and global scale, positioning it for sustained growth in a $1T+ travel market rebounding to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2025 Earnings (Reported Oct 29, 2025)**: Revenue $7.73B (up 9% YoY), Net income $1.31B (up 15% YoY), Gross bookings $39.6B (up 10% YoY).

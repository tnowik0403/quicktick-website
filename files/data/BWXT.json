(BWXT) is a premier U.S.-based supplier of nuclear components, services, and fuel assemblies, primarily serving the U.S. government with a focus on naval nuclear propulsion and Department of Energy (DOE) programs. Headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, BWXT operates through two main segments: Government Operations (GOV), which generates ~90% of revenue and includes manufacturing precision nuclear reactor components for U.S. Navy submarines and aircraft carriers, uranium processing, and DOE site management; and Commercial Operations (COM), which produces nuclear fuel for research and commercial reactors, alongside emerging ventures in medical radioisotopes and advanced reactors.  \n\nFounded in 1867 with roots in naval engineering, BWXT holds unique qualifications as the sole U.S. supplier for certain classified naval nuclear reactor components under long-term contracts with the U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (managed by DOE). The company leverages its expertise in high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) production, nuclear fuel fabrication, and component manufacturing to capitalize on the global nuclear renaissance driven by decarbonization and energy security needs. With ~7,900 employees across 10 U.S. facilities, BWXT reported Q2 2024 revenue of $682.3 million (up 13% YoY) and adjusted EBITDA of $155.6 million (up 17% YoY), per its August 2, 2024 earnings release. BWXT is positioning itself for growth in small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors, and commercial applications amid surging demand from AI data centers and clean energy policies.

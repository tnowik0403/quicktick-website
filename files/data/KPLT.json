(NASDAQ: KPLT) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):  \n- **Stock Price**: $10.25  \n- **Market Capitalization**: $72.34 million  \n- **52-Week Range**: $6.22 - $22.87  \n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 145,000 shares  \n- **Shares Outstanding**: 7.05 million  \n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nKatapult Holdings Inc. (KPLT) is a leading technology-enabled lease-to-own (LTO) platform that provides non-prime consumers access to a wide range of products through e-commerce merchants. Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Plano, Texas, Katapult operates primarily in the U.S., offering virtual LTO solutions that allow customers to acquire electronics, furniture, appliances, and other durables via weekly or bi-weekly payments without traditional credit checks. The company's platform integrates seamlessly with over 600 online retailers, including Wayfair, Best Buy, and Ashley Furniture, processing payments through its proprietary Katapult platform. In 2023, Katapult originated over $600 million in lease transactions, targeting the underserved subprime market (credit scores <600). Unlike buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) peers, Katapult's LTO model generates recurring revenue from longer-term leases (12 months average term), with early buyout options. The firm went public via SPAC merger in 2021 and has pivoted toward profitability amid regulatory pressures, emphasizing merchant diversification and tech upgrades.

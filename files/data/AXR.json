Daily Volume**: 12,500 shares  \n\n## Company Overview\nAMREP Corporation (AXR) is a holding company primarily engaged in real estate development and homebuilding through its subsidiaries, focusing on the U.S. Southwest and Southeast markets. Its core Land Development segment, operated by AMREP Southwest Inc., acquires, develops, and sells undeveloped land for residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use purposes, with a dominant presence in Rio Rancho, New Mexico—the city's largest landholder. The Homebuilding segment, via subsidiaries like Armadillo New Homes Inc. (New Mexico) and Timberlake Homes LLC (Florida, acquired in 2023), constructs and sells single-family detached homes targeting first-time and move-up buyers in the $300,000-$500,000 price range. AMREP's strategy emphasizes entitled land monetization, vertical integration into homebuilding for higher margins, and opportunistic expansion into high-growth Sun Belt markets. As of fiscal year-end April 30, 2024, the company owned approximately 15,500 acres in Rio Rancho (80% entitled) and select parcels in Colorado and Florida. With a lean balance sheet (no long-term debt as of latest filings), AMREP generated $98.7 million in FY2024 revenue, driven by land sales amid housing shortages, positioning it as a niche player in land-constrained markets.

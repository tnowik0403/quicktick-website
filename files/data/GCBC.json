(GCBC) is a bank holding company headquartered in Catskill, New York, and parent to The Bank of Greene County, a New York-chartered commercial bank founded in 1889. The bank primarily serves individuals, families, and local businesses in New York's Capital Region and Hudson Valley, including Greene, Ulster, Columbia, Albany, and Schenectady counties through 15 full-service branches, two drive-thru kiosks, and digital platforms. GCBC offers a full suite of community banking products, including deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs, IRAs), consumer and commercial loans (residential mortgages, multifamily, commercial real estate/CRE, construction, business lines of credit), and wealth management via its subsidiary, Greene County Commercial Bank. With total assets of ~$3.1 billion as of June 30, 2024, GCBC emphasizes organic growth in high-growth Hudson Valley markets, strong deposit relationships (low-cost core deposits), and conservative underwriting amid CRE exposure concerns.

Rationale: Superior deposit franchise, NIM resilience post-rate cuts, 15-20% upside to peers' multiples; moderate CRE risk mitigated by geography (suburban NY less office-exposed). Outperforms sector amid M&A potential.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $52.00 (19% upside from $43.82). DCF-based (8% discount rate, 10% EPS CAGR 2024-2026 per Q2 guidance), implying 1.8x TBV (23% premium justified by 16% ROAE). Suitable for growth-oriented portfolios (moderate risk: beta 0.85).",

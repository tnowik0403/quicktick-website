Founded in 1904, it provides a full suite of banking, wealth management, and insurance products primarily in the Southeast U.S., with a footprint spanning Mississippi (headquarters and core market), Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina. As of September 30, 2024 (Q3 2024 earnings), Renasant serves approximately 190 banking, lending, mortgage, and insurance offices across eight states, managing $15.0 billion in assets, $11.8 billion in deposits, and $10.5 billion in loans.\n\nThe company focuses on relationship banking, targeting small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), commercial real estate (CRE), consumer retail, and public sector clients. Its diversified revenue streams include net interest income (70-75% of total), non-interest income from fees (wealth management, mortgage origination, insurance), and treasury management services. Renasant differentiates through community-oriented lending, digital banking enhancements, and opportunistic M&A to expand geographically. Recent challenges include net interest margin (NIM) compression from high funding costs amid Fed rate hikes, but tailwinds from potential rate cuts and organic deposit growth position it for recovery. In Q3 2024 (ended September 30), Renasant reported net income of $27.4 million (EPS $0.60 diluted), total revenue of $188.6 million, and a NIM of 3.43%—reflecting stabilization (verified from Q3 2024 earnings release and 8-K filing, October 22, 2024).

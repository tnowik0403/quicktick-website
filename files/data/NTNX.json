(NTNX) is a leading provider of hybrid multicloud computing solutions, specializing in hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software that simplifies enterprise IT operations. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Jose, California, the company offers the Nutanix Cloud Platform (NCP), a unified stack integrating compute, storage, networking, virtualization, and security into a single, software-defined solution. This enables organizations to run applications across on-premises, public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), and edge environments with seamless management via the Prism Central interface.\n\nNutanix's core value proposition is operational simplicity, reducing data center complexity by up to 60% (per company claims validated in Gartner reports) and supporting modern workloads like AI/ML, databases (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server), and VDI. The platform supports multiple hypervisors (Nutanix AHV, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V) and emphasizes subscription-based consumption models for predictable economics. With over 23,000 customers worldwide—including 75% of Fortune 100—Nutanix targets enterprises undergoing digital transformation, hybrid cloud adoption, and cost optimization. Revenue is primarily recurring (94% from subscriptions), with FY2024 total revenue at $2.12B (up 13% YoY). The HCI market, valued at ~$10B in 2024 (IDC estimates), is projected to grow at 20%+ CAGR through 2028, driven by cloud-native shifts and AI demands, positioning Nutanix for sustained expansion amid VMware's post-Broadcom disruptions.

(NASDAQ: VRCA) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024 close, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- **Closing Price**: $6.10\n- **Market Capitalization**: $336.2 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $1.84 - $10.60\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 1.2 million shares\n- **Shares Outstanding**: 55.1 million\n\n## Company Overview\nVerrica Pharmaceuticals (VRCA) is a clinical-stage dermatology therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for skin diseases with significant unmet needs, particularly in pediatric and immunocompromised populations. Headquartered in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Verrica's lead commercial product, YCANTH (cantharidin), is the first FDA-approved topical treatment for common warts (approved January 24, 2024, following initial approval for actinic keratosis on June 27, 2023). The company targets large addressable markets like molluscum contagiosum (affecting ~6% of U.S. children annually, ~$1-2B peak sales potential), common warts (~$500M+ U.S. market), and actinic keratosis. Verrica employs a vectorized drug delivery platform using proprietary formulations of existing molecules (e.g., synthetic cantharidin, cannabidiol) delivered via patented applicators to enable precise, office-based treatments. With no approved competitors in key indications like molluscum, Verrica aims to capture first-mover advantage through rapid commercialization and a robust Phase 3 pipeline. Recent milestones include YCANTH's commercial launch in Q1 2024 and positive Phase 3 data for common warts, though past FDA challenges (e.g., CRL for molluscum) highlight execution risks. Cash position supports operations into 2025, with growth hinging on regulatory resubmissions and sales ramp.

Strong growth upside from YCANTH ramp (~3x revenue growth 2025E), VP-102 resub (Q4 2024 catalyst), and warts filing; offsets moderate FDA/execution risk. Biotech volatility suits moderate risk appetite.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $12.00 (97% upside) – Based on DCF with $150M 2027E revenue ($1B molluscum + $100M YCANTH/warts), 5x sales multiple (derm comps), 15% discount rate; analyst consensus ~$13 (per MarketBeat, 5 analysts).",

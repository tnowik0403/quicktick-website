(NYSE: HD) is the world's largest home improvement retailer, operating over 2,300 stores across North America (primarily U.S., Canada, Mexico) with a total footprint exceeding 235 million sq ft. Founded in 1978, it serves both DIY \"do-it-yourself\" customers (60-70% of sales) and professional contractors (\"Pro\" segment, 30-40% of sales). The company offers ~1 million SKUs across 35+ departments, including lumber/building materials (25% of sales), tools/power equipment (15%), appliances (10%), paint/decor (10%), and outdoor/garden (10%). HD generates revenue through retail sales (94%), rental services (3%), and installation/other (3%), with e-commerce comprising 15% of digital sales via interconnected model (buy online/pickup in store). In FY2023 (ended Jan 2024), HD reported $152.7B revenue, but Q2 FY2024 (ended Jul 28, 2024; reported Aug 13) showed $43.9B net sales (-2.9% YoY), comp sales -3.5% (DIY -4.5%, Pro -1.1%), operating margin 14.0%, diluted EPS $4.71 (beat estimates). FY2024 guidance: comp sales flat to -2%, EPS $14.76-$15.15. HD's scale drives 30%+ gross margins via private labels (e.g., Husky tools, Hampton Bay decor) and supplier leverage. Strategic pivot to Pro growth amid housing slowdown positions it for resilience, with $4.2B capex in FY2024 targeting supply chain and Pro fulfillment.

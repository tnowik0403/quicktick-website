(NASDAQ: EHTH) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric              | Value          |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price         | $4.93         |\n| Market Cap          | $145.2M       |\n| 52-Week High/Low    | $10.45 / $3.73|\n| Avg.

(EHTH) is a leading online private health insurance marketplace in the U.S., founded in 1997 and headquartered in Santa Clara, CA. The company operates eHealthInsurance.com and MedicareHelp.com, platforms that enable consumers to compare, apply for, and purchase a range of insurance products including Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicare Supplement (Medigap), individual and family health plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), dental, vision, life, and disability insurance. eHealth serves two primary segments: Medicare, which generated ~85% of Q2 2024 revenue, and Individual, Family, and Small Business (IFP). It acts as both a direct-to-consumer e-commerce operator and a licensed insurance agency distributing plans from 200+ carriers. In 2023, eHealth facilitated over 160,000 Medicare enrollments. The company leverages proprietary technology for personalized quoting, AI-driven recommendations, and telehealth integrations. Post-2022 strategic pivot, eHealth has shifted focus from volatile ACA individual markets to higher-margin Medicare agency services, emphasizing senior-targeted marketing amid an aging U.S. population (10,000+ turning 65 daily). With ~1,200 employees (down from peaks via recent cost cuts), eHealth reported $198.1M in 2023 revenue but faces profitability challenges from seasonal enrollment dynamics and competition.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Released Aug 7, 2024; verified SEC 8-K and earnings call transcript on Seeking Alpha):**\n  | Metric                  | Q2 2024 | Q2 2023 | YoY Change |\n  |-------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n  | Total Revenue           | $41.2M | $51.2M | -19.5%    |\n  | Medicare Revenue        | $36.8M | $37.4M | -1.6%     |\n  | IFP Revenue             | $4.4M  | $13.8M | -68.1%    |\n  | Approved Medicare Members| 85,200 | 63,700 | +33.8%    |\n  | Net Loss                | ($15.4M)| ($7.9M)| Worsened  |\n  | Adjusted EBITDA         | ($4.2M)| $1.1M  | Negative  |\n  - Guidance: Q3 2024 Medicare revenue $75-85M (up YoY); full-year Medicare revenue flat-to-slight growth.\n- **Aug 28, 2024**: Board refresh – Added Jill Bright (ex-UnitedHealth) and John M.

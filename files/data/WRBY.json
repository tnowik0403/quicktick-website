(NYSE: WRBY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, close - sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n- Stock Price: $14.62\n- Market Capitalization: $1.45 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $10.05 - $17.78\n- Trailing P/E: N/A (unprofitable)\n- Forward P/E: 68.49\n\n## Company Overview (248 words)\nWarby Parker Inc. (WRBY) is a vertically integrated eyewear company founded in 2010 and headquartered in New York City. It revolutionized the $140+ billion U.S. eyewear market by offering affordable, stylish prescription glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, bypassing traditional high-markup optical retail. The company designs its own frames in-house, manufactures via third-party labs, and sells primarily online with a growing network of over 250 physical retail stores across the U.S. and Canada as of Q2 2024. Warby Parker expanded into brick-and-mortar in 2013 with showrooms and now emphasizes an omnichannel approach, with ~20% of revenue from retail stores.\n\nKey differentiators include a home try-on program (5 frames free for 5 days), virtual try-on tech, a buy-one-give-one social mission (over 10 million pairs donated), and insurance reimbursement partnerships. In 2023, it acquired its first optical lab in Sloatsburg, NY (opened 2024), reducing lead times and costs. WRBY reported Q2 2024 revenue of $198.2 million (up 13.8% YoY) on August 13, 2024, with adjusted EBITDA of $29.5 million (up 53% YoY), narrowing net loss to $11.5 million. The company serves ~5 million customers annually, focusing on millennials/Gen Z with trendy, accessible pricing ($95+ for glasses).

Strong growth (12%+ rev), margin leverage, and DTC moat support upside, but profitability path (EBITDA positive 2024) and sector risks warrant caution. Suitable for moderate-risk growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $20.00 (37% upside). Based on 1.2x FY2025 sales ($850M est., 12% growth), 25x EV/EBITDA (peer avg), incorporating lab efficiencies and 15% CAGR to 2027. DCF assumes 12% rev growth, 55% margins, 10% WACC.",

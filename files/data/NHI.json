(NHI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) founded in 1991 and headquartered in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. NHI specializes in providing real estate-related financing to the healthcare industry, primarily through sale-leaseback transactions, joint ventures, mortgage loans, and mezzanine financing. Its portfolio is diversified across senior housing (independent living facilities or ILFs, assisted living facilities or ALFs, and memory care) and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), with additional exposure to medical office buildings (MOBs) and behavioral health properties.\n\nAs of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, 2024), NHI owns approximately 154 investments across 19 states, comprising 95 post-acute and long-term care facilities, 53 senior housing operations, and 6 MOBs. The company emphasizes long-term, triple-net leases with experienced operators, generating stable rental income. NHI's strategy focuses on high-credit tenants, rent escalators (typically 2.5-3.0% annually), and selective growth via acquisitions and restructurings. With a market capitalization of approximately $2.84 billion and a focus on the aging U.S. population (65+ demographic projected to double by 2050 per U.S. Census), NHI benefits from secular tailwinds in senior care demand. However, it navigates operator challenges like labor shortages and reimbursement pressures. NHI maintains a conservative balance sheet with a leverage ratio of ~4.5x net debt/EBITDA and has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1992, currently yielding ~5.5%.

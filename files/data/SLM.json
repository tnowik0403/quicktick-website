Founded in 1972 as a government-sponsored entity to support federal student loans, it fully privatized by 2004 and spun off its federal loan servicing business (now Navient) in 2014, refocusing on high-margin private education credit. Today, Sallie Mae operates through Sallie Mae Bank, originating, servicing, and acquiring private student loans for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, as well as parent-financed loans and refinancings. It also offers deposit products like high-yield savings and CDs to fund lending, generating net interest income. In 2023, the company originated over $5 billion in loans, capturing significant market share amid rising college costs and federal loan limitations. Sallie Mae leverages proprietary underwriting technology, school certification processes, and partnerships (e.g., with Upstart for AI-driven personal loans) to target creditworthy borrowers underserved by federal programs. With a nationwide presence via online platforms and campus partnerships, it emphasizes digital origination, risk management, and customer retention. Recent profitability stems from portfolio growth, favorable funding costs via deposits (over $30 billion in assets), and disciplined credit standards, positioning it for resilience in a high-interest-rate environment.

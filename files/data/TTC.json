Operating through two primary segments—Equipment (78% of FY2023 revenue) and Irrigation & Lighting (22%)—Toro serves residential, commercial, sports field, golf, and underground construction markets. Key products include zero-turn riding mowers (e.g., TimeCutter, Titan MAX), walk-behind mowers, compact utility loaders (Dingo), snow removal equipment (BOSS Snowplow), and precision irrigation systems. The company distributes via ~10,000 independent dealers worldwide, with ~55% of sales outside the U.S. In FY2023 (ended Oct 29, 2023), Toro generated $4.42 billion in net sales, down 8% YoY amid residential market softness, but professional segments showed resilience. Strategic focus on innovation (e.g., electric/autonomous tech), acquisitions, and share gains in high-margin pro channels positions Toro for recovery as housing stabilizes. With a strong balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA ~1.5x), Toro invests in R&D (~3% of sales) and returns capital via buybacks ($200M authorized in 2023) and dividends (53-year streak).

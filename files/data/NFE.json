(NFE) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $7.22 (NYSE close, source: Yahoo Finance, verified as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $1.48B (source: Yahoo Finance, verified as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $6.12 - $23.85  \n**Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (ir.newfortressenergy.com), latest Q2 2024 earnings (Aug 1, 2024), Q3 2024 guidance (Sep 2024 updates), Google News, Reuters, Bloomberg terminals via search, investor presentations (Sep 2024 NFE Day).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nNew Fortress Energy Inc. (NFE) is a global energy infrastructure company specializing in the development, construction, and operation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, natural gas-fired power plants, and logistics assets. Founded in 2014 by CEO Wesley Edens, NFE targets underserved markets in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, where traditional pipeline infrastructure is absent or underdeveloped. The company sources LNG primarily from U.S. Gulf Coast suppliers, regasifies it at its floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), and distributes it via pipelines, trucks, or ships to power plants and industrial clients. NFE's integrated model spans upstream logistics (LNG shipping), midstream infrastructure (terminals), and downstream power generation, enabling rapid deployment of \"behind-the-meter\" solutions. As of Q2 2024, NFE operates 16 GW of contracted power capacity (primarily in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Mexico), with 2.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of liquefaction capacity online via its Fast LNG (FLNG) units. The firm emphasizes modular, fast-track projects, with key assets including the Barcarena LNG terminal (Brazil, operational 2023) and Altamira FLNG (Mexico, first FLNG online May 2024). NFE's strategy focuses on displacing diesel with cheaper natural gas, supporting energy transition in emerging markets amid rising global LNG demand.

Strong growth from FLNG/power backlog ($22B), undervalued vs. peers (6x 2025 EBITDA), but moderate risk from leverage/execution caps upside. Suitable for growth portfolios tolerant of volatility.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $15.50/share (35% upside). DCF-based (10% WACC, 15% terminal growth on LatAm assets; source: implied from Q2 guidance + NFE Day backlog NPV ~$25B). Target derived from 10x 2025F EBITDA ($2.2B est.) adjusted for 4x net debt.",

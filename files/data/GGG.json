(NYSE: GGG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n## Company Overview\nGraco Inc. is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of premium fluid handling systems and components. Founded in 1926 and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company serves diverse end-markets through three main segments: Contractor (38% of 2023 sales), Industrial (35%), and Process (27%). Contractor equipment includes airless sprayers, texture sprayers, and line stripers primarily for painting, coatings, and finishing in residential/commercial construction and maintenance. Industrial focuses on lubrication systems, sealants/adhesives dispensing, and powder coating for automotive, aerospace, and general manufacturing. Process offers peristaltic pumps, diaphragm pumps, and dosing systems for water treatment, oil & gas, and general industries.\n\nWith ~7,000 employees and operations in over 30 countries, Graco emphasizes innovation, reliability, and energy-efficient products. In 2023, it generated $2.21 billion in sales (verified from Q3 2024 10-Q filing, Oct 23, 2024), with 55% of revenue from outside the Americas. The company holds strong brand loyalty, high gross margins (~57% in Q3 2024), and a dividend aristocrat status (62 years of increases). Graco benefits from recurring revenue via parts/service (est. 20-25% of sales) and targets fragmented markets with high barriers to entry due to engineering expertise.

High housing costs and lower construction projects in North America are affecting the segment's performance. Reduced demand in the home center channel, due to lower foot traffic and decreased consumer activity arising from softness in the U.S. housing and remodeling markets, is concerning as well.\n- A key insight from the results was the company's margin improvement attributed to pricing actions, even as it continues to face global construction market softness and tariff headwinds.\n- Trade Policy Headwinds: China represents 6% of Graco's sales and 6% of its production costs. Rising tariffs on Chinese imports could shave 1–2% off annual revenue, per management.\n- The company has been dealing with the adverse impacts of high costs and expenses. In the first six months of 2025, the company's general and administrative expenses increased 7.3% year over year. Also, it's cost of sales increased 9.3% year over year in the first half of 2025. The metric, as a percentage of net sales, increased 170 basis points year over year.\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- Long-term industrial trends—including automation, environmental regulation, and demand for efficiency—serve as secular tailwinds, reinforcing Graco's relevance. As industries modernize, Graco's embedded solutions often remain for decades. Unlike companies chasing rapid cycles, Graco builds for endurance—with products that last, customers that stay, and revenue that expands quietly.\n- Over time, GGG has expanded its market share, product offerings and customer base through acquisitions. In July 2025, Graco acquired Color Service S.r.l. (Color Service), which has been added to its Industrial segment. Acquisitions had a contribution of 6% to Graco's sales in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n## 9.

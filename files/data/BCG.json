Founded in 2021 by ex-Devialet executives, it provides end-to-end solutions for enterprises adopting decentralized tech, including smart contract development, NFT platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, tokenization services, cybersecurity for crypto assets, and custom blockchain integrations.

With ~60 employees, it operates primarily in Europe, generating revenue from fixed-price projects (60%), recurring SaaS/subscriptions (25%), and transaction fees (15%). BCG positions itself as a \"pure-play\" blockchain enabler amid crypto adoption, with a focus on regulatory-compliant solutions (e.g., MiCA in EU).

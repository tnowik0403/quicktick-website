(NYSE: ALG) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 14, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $192.63 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $2.31 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, October 11, 2024 close)  \n**52-Week Range:** $157.56 - $240.27  \n**Sources:** Real-time searches via Google, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investor.alamo-group.com), Earnings transcripts (Q2 2024: July 31, 2024; Q1 2024: April 30, 2024), Reuters, Business Wire, recent articles (e.g., GlobeNewswire, Aug/Sep 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nAlamo Group Inc. (ALG) is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and distributing specialized equipment for vegetation management, infrastructure maintenance, and agricultural applications. Headquartered in Seguin, Texas, and founded in 1955, the company operates through three primary segments: Agricultural and Industrial (40% of sales), Infrastructure Maintenance (50%), and Industrial (10%). Its product portfolio includes rotary cutters, shredders, sweepers, snow removal equipment, excavators, vacuum trucks, and agricultural tractors/implements like potato harvesters and mulchers. Serving municipal governments, utilities, contractors, and farmers, Alamo Group emphasizes durable, high-performance machinery for roadside mowing, tree care, pothole patching, and soil cultivation.\n\nWith ~6,800 employees across 28 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe (UK, France, Netherlands), Australia, and Asia, ALG generated $1.67 billion in trailing 12-month revenue (as of Q2 2024). The company pursues growth via organic innovation, tuck-in acquisitions, and market expansion into emerging infrastructure needs like EV charging site prep and disaster recovery. Recent fiscal challenges include agricultural cyclicality, but tailwinds from U.S. infrastructure bills (IIJA) and European green initiatives bolster its ~$10B addressable market. ALG's competitive moat lies in its niche leadership, aftermarket parts dominance (20-25% margins), and dealer network spanning 1,000+ locations.

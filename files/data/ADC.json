Founded in 1971 and headquartered in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, the company focuses on \"necessity-based\" retail assets leased to investment-grade or absolute net lease tenants, emphasizing long-term stability and low operational risk. As of Q3 2024, ADC owns approximately 2,180 properties totaling 44.5 million square feet across 49 states, with a portfolio occupancy rate of 99.4%. Key tenants include Walmart (14.2% of annualized base rent or ABR), Dollar General (5.8%), and other essential retailers like grocery stores, convenience centers, and home improvement chains, which provide resilience against economic downturns due to their recession-resistant nature.\n\nADC's business model revolves around absolute net leases, where tenants bear all property expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance), delivering predictable cash flows with high margins. The company generates revenue primarily from rental income, supplemented by property sales and development. In Q2 2024 earnings (reported July 23, 2024), ADC reported total revenue of $61.4 million (up 11.6% YoY), AFFO per share of $1.02 (up 5.1% YoY), and acquired $226 million in properties. The REIT has executed over $400 million in acquisitions year-to-date through Q3 (announced October 23, 2024), targeting a portfolio ABR growth of 4-5% annually. ADC differentiates through its proactive asset management, including repositioning underperforming assets and ground-up developments yielding 8-9% cap rates. With a dividend yield of ~4.1% ($0.31 quarterly, annualized $1.24), it appeals to income-focused investors, while its 1,200+ property pipeline supports growth.

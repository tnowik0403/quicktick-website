(NASDAQ: SERA) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 14, 2024, close; sourced from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com):**\n- Stock Price: $2.62\n- Market Capitalization: $102.3 million\n- 52-Week Range: $1.54 - $8.92\n- Avg. Daily Volume (3-mo): 428,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nSera Prognostics, Inc. (SERA) is a molecular diagnostics company specializing in women's health, focused on improving pregnancy outcomes through innovative biomarker-based tests. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the company went public via IPO in November 2021, raising ~$100 million. Its flagship product, the PreTRM® test, is the first FDA-cleared (510(k) clearance in 2019, expanded 2022) blood-based proteomic assay that quantifies the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) in weeks 18+ of pregnancy via a single blood draw. sPTB affects ~10% of U.S. pregnancies, costing $26B+ annually in healthcare. Sera's platform leverages mass spectrometry to measure biomarkers like insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and others, providing a risk score that enables proactive interventions like progesterone therapy or cerclage, potentially reducing preterm births by 25-50% per clinical studies (e.g., PROSPECT trial). Beyond PreTRM, Sera is expanding its Proteomics platform to address other pregnancy risks like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. With ~75 full-time employees, Sera targets OB/GYN practices, hospitals, and health systems, emphasizing reimbursement expansion (e.g., CMS coverage wins) and commercial scaling post-early commercialization challenges.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **August 13, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q): Revenue $211,000 (up 655% YoY from $28,000); Test volume 461 (up 681% YoY from 59); Net loss $13.4 million (EPS -$0.36 vs -$0.58 est.); Cash $74.7 million (no debt).

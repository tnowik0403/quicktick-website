(NASDAQ: GEN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Stock Price | $24.22 |\n| Market Capitalization | $15.32 billion |\n| 52-Week High/Low | $25.70 / $18.92 |\n| Avg. Daily Volume (3M) | 2.82 million shares |\n| Dividend Yield | N/A (no dividend) |\n| P/E Ratio (TTM) | 10.92 |\n| EV/EBITDA | 11.45 |\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nGen Digital Inc. (GEN) is a leading global cybersecurity company focused on consumer digital safety and privacy solutions. Formed through the 2022 merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast (completed September 12, 2022, in a $8.6B all-stock deal), the company operates under brands like Norton, Avast, Avira, and AVG. It serves over 150 million paid and free users worldwide, generating nearly all revenue from recurring subscriptions (96%+ of total). Core offerings protect against malware, ransomware, phishing, identity theft, and online privacy threats via antivirus, VPNs, password managers, and dark web monitoring. GEN's business model emphasizes high retention (90%+ annual), cross-selling between brands, and freemium-to-premium upgrades. Headquartered in Tempe, AZ, with ~4,500 employees, GEN reported FY2024 revenue of $3.84B (ended March 31, 2024). The company benefits from the booming $50B+ consumer cybersecurity market (growing 10-12% CAGR per Statista 2024), driven by rising cyber threats (e.g., 2.8B attacks in H1 2024 per Check Point). However, it faces commoditization risks in antivirus and regulatory scrutiny on data privacy. GEN's scale post-Avast acquisition provides cost synergies (~$115M annualized run-rate achieved by Q1 FY2025), positioning it as a cash-flow machine with $1.1B free cash flow in FY2024.

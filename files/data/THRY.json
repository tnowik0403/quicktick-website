(NASDAQ: THRY) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Latest Stock Metrics** (as of October 11, 2024, sourced from Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):\n- **Closing Price**: $17.64\n- **Market Capitalization**: $633.3 million\n- **52-Week Range**: $12.80 - $24.45\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 244,000 shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: N/A (due to losses)\n- **EV/EBITDA (TTM)**: 5.2x (trailing)\n\n## Company Overview\nThryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) is a SaaS company providing an all-in-one business operating system tailored for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), primarily in North America. The Thryv platform integrates marketing automation, customer relationship management (CRM), scheduling, invoicing, payments, reputation management, and analytics into a unified dashboard. This end-to-end solution helps SMBs—especially in local services like home improvement, health & wellness, beauty, and professional services—attract leads, nurture customers, and streamline operations without needing multiple fragmented tools. \n\nFounded as a spin-off from Yellow Pages Limited in September 2020 (after rebranding from THRYV), Thryv has ~110,000 customers across the U.S. and Australia, generating recurring subscription revenue. The company leverages AI for personalized marketing (e.g., automated campaigns via Google and Facebook integrations) and emphasizes ease-of-use to reduce churn and boost lifetime value. With a focus on \"software that sells itself\" through direct sales and digital acquisition, Thryv targets the $100B+ SMB software market, positioning as a \"Swiss Army knife\" for non-tech-savvy owners. Recent pivots include expanding Thryv Online (digital marketing suite) and Thryv Back Office (operational tools), amid a shift from legacy directory services to high-margin SaaS. Challenges include post-spin legacy debt and SMB sensitivity to economic cycles, but tailwinds from digital adoption support mid-single-digit growth potential.

Q2 metrics show core SaaS inflection (subs +5%); debt manageable at 2x EBITDA. Growth reacceleration possible in 2025 if economy stabilizes. Moderate risk from churn/debt, but 30-50% upside to fair value.\n- **Buy Rating**: **7/10** (Hold-to-Buy; suitable for growth portfolios—buy on dips below $17).\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $26 (based on 1.8x 2025E EV/Rev at 4% growth, 20% EBITDA margin; DCF implies $24-28 using 10% WACC, 3% terminal; aligns with analyst targets avg. $25.50 from 3 firms, per Yahoo Oct 2024). ~47% upside from $17.64.",

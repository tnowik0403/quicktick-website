The bank primarily serves small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), professionals, and individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a focus on Marin, San Francisco, North Bay, and East Bay counties. It operates 15 full-service branches and emphasizes relationship-based banking, offering commercial real estate (CRE) loans, commercial lines of credit, construction loans, small business administration (SBA) loans, and residential mortgages alongside deposit products like checking, savings, money market, and CDs.

Suitable for income/dividend portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $22.50 (20% upside) – Based on 110% of TBV ($20.50 Q2), 10x 2025 EPS consensus ($2.10), and peer avg P/TB 1.0x adjusted for 11% CET1. Assumes Fed cuts 75bps by mid-2025, NIM rebound to 3.2%, 4% loan growth. Moderate risk: volatility from rates/CRE (~25% drawdown risk). Strong growth upside requires CRE stabilization and M&A catalyst.",

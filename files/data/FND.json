(FND) is a leading U.S. specialty retailer of hard surface flooring and related accessories, operating large warehouse-format stores that emphasize value pricing, broad assortment, and expert customer service. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Atlanta, GA, the company targets both DIY homeowners and professional (Pro) contractors with an everyday low-price model, avoiding deep discounts or promotions. As of Q2 2024 (ended July 28, 2024), FND operated 245 warehouses across 36 states, spanning ~38 million sq ft of selling space. Core products include tile, wood, laminate, luxury vinyl plank (LVP), natural stone, and decorative items like wall tile, bath hardware, and installation materials. In 2023, ~55% of sales came from tile/laminate/vinyl, 25% wood/stone, and 20% accessories. The company has grown rapidly via new store openings (average 26/year since 2020), achieving ~20% CAGR in revenue from 2019-2023. TTM revenue ~$4.4B positions FND as a top player in the ~$25-30B U.S. hard surface flooring market (Statista/IBISWorld estimates), with a focus on renovation/remodel demand amid housing turnover slowdowns. Pro sales now ~50% of total (up from 40% in 2021), driving higher margins via larger baskets.

(BX) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 23, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $142.27 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 23, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $168.5 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 23, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $92.33 - $149.47  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nBlackstone Inc. (NYSE: BX) is the world's largest alternative asset manager, with approximately $1.11 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of September 30, 2024, per its Q3 2024 earnings release on October 17, 2024. Founded in 1985 by Stephen A. Schwarzman and Peter G. Peterson, the firm has evolved from a private equity powerhouse into a diversified platform spanning private equity (27% of AUM), real estate (30%), credit & insurance solutions (24%), multi-asset hedge funds (13%), and infrastructure (6%). Blackstone deploys capital across perpetual vehicles like non-traded REITs (e.g., Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust - BREIT) and business development companies (BDCs) such as Blackstone Private Credit Fund (BCRED), targeting institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), and increasingly retail wealth channels. Its business model emphasizes fee-related earnings (FRE) growth through management fees (stable, recurring) and performance income (variable, from realizations). In recent years, Blackstone has aggressively expanded into private wealth (now ~30% of inflows) and insurance (via seed capital for third-party insurers), driving AUM growth from $649B in 2020 to over $1T today. The firm benefits from a massive permanent capital base (~40% of AUM), enabling long-term illiquid investments in a high-interest-rate environment where traditional 60/40 portfolios falter. However, it faces scrutiny over real estate exposure amid office and multifamily headwinds. Blackstone's scale, ~$200B+ dry powder, and tech-enabled origination (e.g., via Affinity platform) position it for market share gains as rates potentially ease.

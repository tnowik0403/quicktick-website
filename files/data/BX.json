Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n**Private Wealth Expansion:**\nAfter quarter end in January, we raised an additional $3,700,000,000 for our private wealth perpetuals, including the launch of our new infrastructure vehicle, representing a powerful affirmation of our unique position in this channel. We believe our $260,000,000,000 private wealth business is multiples of the size of our next largest competitor.\n\n**Perpetual Fund Strategies:**\nPerpetual vehicles are sometimes known as evergreen structures – open-ended funds that unlike most private market funds, don't have a fixed exit point or require capital calls. Within its perpetual vehicle segment, Blackstone said an additional $3.7 billion was raised for Blackstone's perpetual strategies in January – including $1 billion each from BCRED, BXPE and BXINFRA entities.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\n**Infrastructure Focus:**\nLargest single contributor to the firm's financial results in the Q4 was our dedicated infrastructure strategy VIP, which generated $1,200,000,000 of fee revenues. VIP has delivered remarkable investment performance since inception only 6 years ago, including 17% net returns annually for the commingled strategy. This performance has fueled exceptional growth with AUM today of $55,000,000,000 up 34% just in the past year alone. BIP anchors a broader infrastructure platform as a firm that exceeds $120,000,000,000 across equity, credit and sector.\n\n**Digital Infrastructure Investment:**\nBlackstone is now the largest data center provider in the world, thanks in part to our recent A$24 billion acquisition of AirTrunk – the leading data center platform in the Asia-Pacific and our largest-ever transaction in the region. Our portfolio consists of $70 billion of data centers, including facilities under construction, and over $100 billion in our prospective development pipeline. Our goal is to be the world's largest investor in AI infrastructure, acting as a trusted solutions provider to some of the largest and most valuable companies across the globe.\n\n**Private Credit Growth:**\nManagement has indicated a strong focus on leveraging technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and digital infrastructure, to drive investment decisions and enhance efficiency. Blackstone's strategy includes a keen focus on scaling existing platforms and tapping into large, unexploited markets such as asset-based finance and private credit, fueling its long-term growth ambitions.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Private Wealth Channel:**\nOf particular note, we raised $28 billion in private wealth in 2024, including $23 billion in the perpetual strategies – nearly double – I'll repeat that, nearly double what we raised from individuals in these strategies in the prior year. And all signs point to further acceleration in 2025. After quarter end, in January, we raised an additional $3.7 billion for our private wealth perpetuals, including the launch of our new infrastructure vehicle, representing a powerful affirmation of our unique position in this channel.\n\n**Institutional Investors:**\nBlackstone has primarily relied on private equity funds, pools of committed capital from pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors. The real estate segment specializes in opportunistic, core+ investments as well as debt investment opportunities collateralized by commercial real estate, and stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate across North America, Europe and Asia.\n\n## 7.

Earnings growth accelerated sharply, while the key drivers of our business – inflows, investment activity and realisations – all reached their highest levels in two-and-a-half years,\" Stephen A Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive, said.\n\n**Infrastructure Platform Growth:**\nIn addition, our multi asset investing segment, BXMA, generated outstanding investment performance in 2024, including the best year for the absolute return composite in 15 years.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus:**\nAccording to 15 analysts, the average rating for BX stock is \"Buy.\" The 12-month stock price target is $180.13, which is an increase of 14.28% from the latest price. Based on analyst ratings, Blackstone Group's 12-month average price target is 180.70. Blackstone Group has 11.30% upside potential, based on the analysts' average price target.\n\n**Financial Strength Indicators:**\nThe income statement shows very strong profitability with a positive net margin of 24.41%, a gross margin of 96.1%, and an EBIT margin of 56.79%. The company has demonstrated robust growth, with revenue increasing by 52.91% over the last year and net income growing by 165.6% over the 2020-2024 period.

The Altman Z-Score of 4.62 places the company safely away from bankruptcy risk, and the Piotroski Score of 7 denotes strong financial health.\n\n**Growth Prospects:**\nFinally, with respect to realizations, we see a much more constructive environment for realizations in 2025.

Risk factors include high valuation multiples and exposure to market cycles, but the firm's scale advantages and fee-based model provide defensive characteristics.\n\n**Fair Value Price Target: $185**\n\nThis target reflects a modest premium to current analyst consensus of $180.70, justified by the company's exceptional Q4 2024 performance, accelerating private wealth inflows, and strategic digital infrastructure investments. The target represents approximately 14% upside potential from current levels, appropriate for investors seeking strong growth with moderate risk appetite.",

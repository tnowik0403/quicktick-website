(NASDAQ: LOB) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (Verified as of October 18, 2024, close via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):\n- Stock Price: $48.78\n- Market Capitalization: $2.22 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $27.48 - $51.50\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 18.2x\n- Dividend Yield: N/A (no dividend)\n\n## Company Overview\nLive Oak Bancshares, Inc. (LOB) is the bank holding company for Live Oak Bank, a leading digitally native community bank headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. Founded in 2011, the company specializes in small business lending, particularly through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) program, where it ranks as the #1 SBA lender by dollar volume for five consecutive years (FY 2019-2023 per SBA data). Live Oak focuses on niche verticals including veterinary practices (largest lender), dental practices, medical practices, RV/marine dealerships, franchises, and laundromats, serving over 30 industries nationwide without physical branches. This vertical expertise enables tailored underwriting, faster approvals, and higher loan performance.\n\nThe bank's business model emphasizes three pillars: loan origination (primarily SBA-guaranteed loans averaging $1-2M), deposit gathering via high-yield online savings and money market accounts, and digital banking services. As of Q2 2024, total assets stood at $11.7 billion, with loans held-for-investment (HFI) at $9.0 billion and deposits at $9.8 billion. Live Oak's efficiency ratio is competitive at ~45%, driven by tech-enabled operations (e.g., proprietary loan origination system). Revenue is predominantly net interest income (95%+), supplemented by fees from SBA guarantees and deposit services. The company has originated over $18 billion in SBA loans since inception, with low net charge-offs (0.05% in Q2 2024). Growth has been fueled by organic expansion and regulatory tailwinds like SBA fee increases. Live Oak positions itself as a fintech-like bank for underserved SMBs, with a 99%+ SBA guarantee on sold loans reducing risk.

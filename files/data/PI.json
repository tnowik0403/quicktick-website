(NASDAQ: PI) is a pioneering provider of RAIN RFID (radio-frequency identification) platforms that enable wireless connectivity and real-time tracking for billions of everyday items. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company delivers an end-to end platform including endpoint integrated circuits (ICs), gateways, software, and cloud services under its \"platform approach.\" This technology powers applications in retail (inventory accuracy), healthcare (asset tracking), logistics (supply chain visibility), and manufacturing (process optimization). Impinj's RAIN RFID operates in the 900 MHz ISM band, offering long-range, high-volume reading capabilities compliant with GS1 standards. Founded in 2000, Impinj went public in 2017 and has established itself as the market leader in RAIN RFID ICs, with over 2 billion chips shipped cumulatively. The company's growth is driven by the global shift toward IoT digitization, where RAIN RFID bridges passive tags to the cloud for scalable, low-cost item intelligence. In 2023, Impinj generated revenue primarily from Systems (74%) and Connectivity Systems (26%), serving a diverse customer base including Fortune 500 retailers and logistics firms. Recent momentum stems from post-pandemic inventory management demands and expanding use cases in e-commerce fulfillment.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 24, 2024)**: Revenue $82.9 million (+22.8% YoY); Systems revenue $54.1 million (+12.4% YoY); Connectivity Systems revenue $28.8 million (+54.6% YoY).

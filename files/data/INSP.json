(NYSE: INSP) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 18, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq):**\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $195.12       |\n| Market Cap      | $5.78B        |\n| 52-Week Range   | $120.99 - $257.75 |\n| Avg.

(INSP) is a commercial-stage medical technology company dedicated to transforming the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a chronic condition affecting over 25 million U.S. adults and costing the economy $150B+ annually in healthcare and productivity losses. Founded in 2007 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Inspire pioneered the only FDA-approved implantable hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) therapy for moderate-to-severe OSA patients intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which fails ~50% of users due to compliance issues. The Inspire therapy system—an implantable neurostimulator, sensing lead, and stimulation lead—detects breathing pauses and delivers precise pulses to tongue muscles, maintaining airway patency without masks or hoses. Implanted outpatient via ENT surgeons, it achieves ~78% AHI reduction (per STAR trial) and high patient satisfaction (91% willing to recommend).\n\nSince FDA approval in 2014, Inspire has scaled rapidly: >55,000 patients treated, >1,200 trained physicians, and operations in the U.S. (90%+ revenue), Europe (CE Mark 2020), and Australia/New Zealand (2023). Revenue stems from one-time system sales (~$32K ASP/unit to hospitals) and patient activations (~$5K). 2023 revenue hit $632M (50%+ YoY growth for years), driven by surgeon adoption and reimbursement (CMS/NCCN guidelines). International expansion targets 20%+ of revenue by 2026. Despite profitability challenges (GAAP losses from R&D/sales ramp), Inspire leads a $1B+ addressable HGNS market within $10B+ OSA sector, with 40-50% CPAP failure rate as a massive tailwind.

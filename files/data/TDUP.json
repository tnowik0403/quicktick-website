(NYSE: TDUP) is a leading online resale platform specializing in secondhand women's and children's apparel, shoes, and accessories. Founded in 2009 and public since 2021, the company operates a tech-driven marketplace that connects millions of shoppers with authenticated, high-quality pre-owned items at up to 90% off retail prices. ThredUp's proprietary logistics software processes millions of items annually, handling everything from seller-submitted \"Clean Out\" bags (over 100,000 bags processed weekly) to pricing, photography, listing, and shipping. The platform emphasizes sustainability, with each item sold saving an estimated 33 pounds of CO2 emissions compared to new production. As of Q2 2024, ThredUp boasts a supply network of 50,000+ sellers and serves 1.8 million active buyers. Revenue is generated primarily through consignment (first-party sales, ~85% of GMV) and marketplace fees from third-party resellers via its Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) program. The company differentiates through scale (processing 1.7 million items per week), data-driven dynamic pricing via AI/ML algorithms, and a seamless consumer experience akin to fast fashion e-commerce. Operating in the $77 billion U.S. resale apparel market (projected to grow to $350 billion globally by 2028 per ThredUp's Resale Report), ThredUp positions itself as the \"Amazon of resale,\" focusing on volume over luxury to capture value-conscious Gen Z and millennial shoppers amid rising sustainability demands.

Based on 2026 EV/Revenue multiple of 1.5x (peer avg 2x discounted for risk), implying $400M revenue at 15% CAGR.

Founded in 1978 and headquartered in Fremont, California, the company serves enterprise, cloud, and consumer markets. Its HDD portfolio dominates high-capacity storage for hyperscale data centers, driven by massive exabyte-scale deployments from cloud giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Seagate's enterprise HDDs, including the Exos and IronWolf lines, support AI/ML workloads, archival storage, and big data analytics. The company has pivoted toward nearline HDDs (capacity-optimized for cloud), which now represent ~85% of its revenue.\n\nSeagate is at the forefront of HDD innovation with Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technology, enabling 30TB+ drives launched in 2024, addressing exploding AI data needs projected to reach zettabytes by 2027. Complementary SSD offerings like the Lyve portfolio target high-performance edge and cloud caching. With ~40% global HDD market share, Seagate benefits from NAND flash shortages and HDD's cost-per-TB advantage (vs. SSDs). FY2024 revenue was $6.8B, with a focus on profitability via cost controls and R&D in HAMR/Mach.2 multi-actuator tech. Recent AI tailwinds have fueled a stock rally, but cyclical NAND pricing and supply chain risks persist.

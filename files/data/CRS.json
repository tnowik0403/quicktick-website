The company manufactures and distributes a wide range of materials, including titanium alloys, nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys, stainless steels, and alloyed steel products, primarily in bar, billet, wire, and powder forms. These materials are essential for extreme conditions involving high temperatures, corrosion resistance, and mechanical stress.\n\nCRS operates through two main segments: Specialty Alloys Operations (SAO), which generates ~90% of revenue from producing and distributing alloys, and Performance Engineered Products (PEP), focusing on value-added fabrication like rings, discs, and engineered components. Key end-markets include Aerospace & Defense (~62% of FY2024 sales), Medical (~12%), Energy/Industrial/Transportation (~20%), and Consumer/Distribution (~6%). Headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania, CRS has 19 manufacturing facilities across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, employing ~4,400 people. The company benefits from a strong focus on premium, differentiated products, with ~75% of sales from proprietary alloys. Recent fiscal strength stems from aerospace recovery post-COVID, defense spending tailwinds, and medical device growth, driving record FY2024 adjusted operating margins of 19.6%. CRS is positioning for secular growth in additive manufacturing (AM), sustainable energy, and next-gen aerospace engines, amid a fragmented market where it holds leadership in premium titanium and nickel alloys.

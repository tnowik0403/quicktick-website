It provides innovative financing solutions primarily to independent used-car dealers across the United States, enabling them to sell vehicles to consumers with subprime credit histories (FICO scores typically below 620). CAC's core business revolves around purchasing retail installment sales contracts (RSCs) from dealers under its Portfolio Program, where it originates, holds, and services high-yield auto loans averaging 4-5 year terms at interest rates of 20-25%. As of Q3 2024, CAC managed over 2.5 million active contracts with a total portfolio balance exceeding $6.5 billion.\n\nThe company's model emphasizes dealer relationships (over 15,000 active dealers) and advanced analytics for underwriting, collections, and repossessions. Revenue is generated from finance charges (85-90% of total), servicing fees, and premium finance charges. CAC does not rely on securitizations for funding, using warehouse lines and senior notes instead. In Q3 2024 (ended September 30), it originated $1.066 billion in new loans, up 7% YoY, amid a challenging subprime auto lending environment marked by rising delinquencies. CAC's focus on near-prime and subprime segments differentiates it from prime lenders like Ally Financial.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Released October 29, 2024)**: GAAP net income of $88.1 million ($6.91 diluted EPS), up from $63.9 million ($4.72 EPS) YoY.

Analysts (Seeking Alpha, Oct 2024) project 8-10% CAGR in volumes through 2027.\n\n## Comparison to Competitors\n\n| Metric (Q3 2024 or Latest) | CAC | Consumer Portfolio Services (CPSS) | Oportun Financial (OPRT) | Westlake Financial (Private) |\n|----------------------------|-----|------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Loan Volume YoY Growth** | +7% | +5% (Q2) | -2% (Q2) | +12% (Est.) |\n| **Delinquency Rate (60+)** | 9.3% | 10.1% | 7.8% | 8.5% (Est.) |\n| **Yield** | 22.1% | 20.5% | 18.2% | 21% (Est.) |\n| **Market Cap** | $5.21B | $0.25B | $0.35B | N/A |\n| **Edge** | Scale & dealer network | Lower yields | Unsecured personal loans | Larger share |\n\nCAC outperforms on profitability (ROE 25%+ TTM) but trails Westlake on volume.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Exclusive dealer integrations with Dealertrack/AutoIMS (Cox Automotive); no major new since 2023 CDK alliance.\n- **M&A**: None since 2018 (small tuck-ins); focus on organic growth per Q3 call.\n- **Current Major Clients**: Top 10 dealers <5% of volumes (diversified); key partners include independent chains in Southeast/Midwest.\n- **Potential Clients**: Targeting Carvana/AutoNation subprime arms; EV dealer pilots (e.g., Sonic Automotive discussions, unconfirmed).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Moderate—strong governance (no scandals); collections practices criticized in past CFPB suits (settled 2022).\n- **Management**: CEO Brett Roberts (since 2022) emphasized \"disciplined growth\" in Oct 29 earnings call.\n- **Analyst Consensus**: 4 Buys, 2 Holds (avg PT $510, Zacks Oct 31, 2024).\n- **Risks**: Credit cycle sensitivity; no hedges on rates.\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (**Hold with Upside Bias**). Strong Q3 beat and 11x P/E (below historical 15x) support holding; growth upside from volumes offsets delinquency risks in moderate-risk portfolio.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $485 (15% upside). Based on 12x 2025 EPS ($38.50 fwd est., consensus), 9% loan growth, and 20% yield stability. DCF assumes 10% CAGR volumes, 8% delinquencies.",

The company owns or operates 153 facilities across 11 states, including 116 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) with ~15,000 beds, 25 assisted living (AL) communities, 5 independent living (IL) communities, 4 sub-acute units, and 3 hospitals. NHC also provides homecare, hospice, and physician services through affiliates. Unlike pure-play REITs, NHC operates its facilities (triple-net lease model for some) and emphasizes private-pay revenue (over 50%) to mitigate Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement risks. With ~12,000 employees, NHC targets senior living in secondary/mid-tier markets, generating stable occupancy-driven cash flows. Annual revenue hovers near $1B, with a focus on operational efficiency amid aging demographics. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1992, appealing to income investors, but trades at a premium valuation due to consistent profitability.

AL share to grow 20% via private-pay focus. Bear case: Flat if labor inflation >5%.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (TTM as of Q3 2024) | NHC | ENSG (Ensign) | BKD (Brookdale) | ORC (Omega REIT) |\n|----------------------------|-----|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Revenue | $1.22B | $4.0B | $3.0B | $0.9B (REIT) |\n| EBITDA Margin | 13.5% | 15.2% | 8.1% | 90% (REIT) |\n| Occupancy (SNF/AL) | 87%/92% | 85%/90% | 82%/85% | N/A |\n| EV/EBITDA | 14.2x | 18.5x | 10.1x | 12x |\n| YTD Stock Perf. | +55% | +45% | +20% | +15% |\n- **Edge**: NHC outperforms on margins/occupancy vs. BKD (distressed operator); lags ENSG on scale but trades cheaper.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Medicare Advantage plans (e.g., Humana, UnitedHealth; 20% SNF admissions); Epic Systems for EHR.\n- **M&A**: Acquired 4 facilities YTD ($45M total); sold 2 underperforming SNFs (Mar 2024, $15M gain).\n- **Major Clients**: Private-pay seniors (55% revenue); Medicaid (30%), Medicare (15%). Potential: Expanding MA contracts (target 25% mix by 2026).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Strong governance (family-led mgmt, CEO Carl Adams since 1986); low turnover (15% vs. industry 40%).\n- **Moat**: Geographic density in Sunbelt; owned facilities (60%) reduce rent risk.\n- **Risks**: Regulatory (staffing rules); cyclical occupancy.\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish online (StockTwits/Reddit: 75% buy recs); analyst consensus \"Hold\" (avg PT $120 from 2 analysts, Zacks).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold with upside bias). Strong occupancy/dividend growth supports holding; growth via beds/homecare offers 15-20% upside, but labor/regulatory risks cap to moderate buy for growth portfolios.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $155/share (20% upside from $129.85). Based on 16x 2025E EBITDA ($45M est., 12% growth) + DCF (8% discount rate, 3% terminal growth), aligning with ENSG premium for execution track record. Moderate risk: Beta 0.9, resilient to recessions.",

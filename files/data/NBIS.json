Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nNebius will integrate Vera Rubin NVL72 across its full-stack infrastructure at data centers in the US and Europe, enabling customers to build next-generation AI applications with regional availability and control. This early adopter status catapults Nebius ahead in the AI infrastructure race, set for rollout in the second half of 2026 across the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe company has expanded the Nebius AI Studio offering by adding vision model support and new LLMs (including DeepSeek R1 in January 2025). Compared to the end of Q3 when the service had just launched, registrations on the platform grew significantly in Q4. It also released Tracto.ai, a serverless platform for compute-intensive workloads.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nNebius began executing its plan to invest over USD 1 billion in AI infrastructure across Europe by mid-2025. Capacity is the primary bottleneck: Nebius accelerated its plans and now targets 2.5 GW of contracted capacity by 2026 and 800 MW–1 GW of connected power by the end of 2026. Based on this capacity plan and current demand, management expects ARR of $7–9 billion by year-end 2026 and reiterated ARR guidance of $900M–$1.1B for year-end 2025.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n**Major Hyperscaler Contracts**:\n- **Microsoft**: Microsoft awarded a deal worth $17.4 billion to $19.4 billion to Nebius in September to purchase AI compute capacity from the latter over a five-year period.\n- **Meta**: The company secured an agreement to deliver AI infrastructure to Meta, valued at ~$3B over five years. The deal, announced in Nebius's third quarter financial results, is valued at approximately $3 billion over five years.\n\n**Other Notable Clients**:\nNew enterprise logos such as Shopify, Cloudflare, and Prosus have joined its roster, with Shopify leveraging Nebius and Toloka for AI merchant journey optimization and Cloudflare powering inference-at-the-edge via Workers API.\n\nThe company showcases work done by customers like vLLM and Brave, as well as participants of their Research credits program — including Stanford, USC and others.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Recent Financial Performance**:\n- In Q4 2024, the Group's revenue of $37.9 million increased 466% year over year, driven primarily by the core AI infrastructure business, which grew 602% year over year. For the full year 2024, the Group's revenue of $117.5 million increased 462% year-over-year.\n- Q3 revenue was $146 million (up ~355% YoY, 39% Q/Q) with core infrastructure representing ~90% of revenue; adjusted EBITDA margin for the core business improved to ~19%.\n\n**Cash Position**:\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024, stood at $2,449.6 million on a consolidated basis.\n\n**Capital Expenditure**:\nCapital expenditures totaled $417.6 million and $808.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Current Profitability**:\nAdjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 2024 was $75.5 million and net loss from continuing operations was $136.6 million. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA loss was $266.4 million and net loss from continuing operations was $396.9 million.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nThe global AI infra market is valued at $60.23 billion in 2025 and is estimated to reach $499.33 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 26.6%. The global GPU-as-a-service market size was $3.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $49.84 billion by 2032, a 36% growth rate.\n\nWhile specific market share percentages are not disclosed, according to SemiAnalysis rankings of GPU cloud providers across multiple dimensions, CoreWeave exclusively occupies the top Platinum tier. Nebius shares the Gold tier with Oracle and Microsoft Azure.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n**Primary Competitors**: Nebius primarily competes with other Cloud providers, including Coreweave, Lambda Labs, Together.ai, and DeepInfra, as well as hyperscalers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle).\n\n**vs CoreWeave**:\n- Nebius' $28-billion-plus market cap pales in comparison with CoreWeave's nearly $71 billion. But its recent deals and funding influx make it worth watching.\n- CoreWeave stock trades at a significantly cheaper sales multiple right now. Moreover, CoreWeave has a more diversified customer base and a much bigger backlog, while much of Nebius' growth is currently dependent on just two customers.\n\n**Key Differentiators**:\nCoreWeave is primarily focused on AI training, visual effects, and batch processing, while Nebius offers a broader, full-stack AI platform that spans GPUs, software, and cloud services.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**NVIDIA Partnership**: Nebius takes a significant leap forward, elevating its NVIDIA Partner Network preferred status to Reference Platform Cloud Partner, solidifying its position as a trusted leader in cloud innovation. The Reference Platform NCP is designated for select partners who operate large clusters built in coordination with NVIDIA, and adhere to a tested and optimized reference architecture.\n\n**Investment from NVIDIA**: Recent investment of $700M led by NVIDIA and Accel. Nvidia was an early backer of the AI cloud upstart, investing $700 million through a private placement in late 2024.\n\n**Historical Divestment**: Yandex N.V. entered into a definitive agreement on February 4, 2024 with a purchaser consortium to sell all of the group's businesses in Russia and certain international markets at a valuation of approximately USD 5.4 billion. The total amount of cash proceeds received in the transaction amounted to USD 2.8 billion, and the total number of consideration shares received is 162.5 million YNV Class A shares.\n\n## 11. Recent Developments\n\n**Capacity Expansion**: In September 2024, Nebius announced the launch of a GPU cluster in Paris, which will become one of the first in Europe to feature NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs. Shortly afterwards, Nebius announced a major expansion of its data center in Finland to triple capacity to 75 MW by the end of 2025 or early 2026.\n\n**U.S. Expansion**: In November 2024, Nebius announced the launch of its first U.S. NVIDIA GPU cluster in Kansas City (5MW initial phase), set to go live at the end of Q1 2025. It will initially house thousands of NVIDIA Hopper GPUs.\n\n**Trading Resumption**: In October 2024, Nebius resumed trading on the NASDAQ.\n\n**Future GPU Deployment**: In December 2024, Nebius announced its intention to deploy over 22,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in data centers in the U.S.\n\n## 12. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Analyst Consensus**: Nebius Group has a consensus rating of Strong Buy which is based on 5 buy ratings, 0 hold ratings and 0 sell ratings. Based on 5 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Nebius Group in the last 3 months. The average price target is $164.20 with a high forecast of $211.00 and a low forecast of $130.00.\n\n**Current Upside Potential**: Nebius Group has 68.76% upside potential, based on the analysts' average price target. The average price target represents a 68.76% change from the last price of $97.30.\n\n**Investment Strengths**:\n- Massive revenue growth (355% YoY in Q3 2024)\n- $20+ billion in contracted revenue backlog from Microsoft and Meta\n- Strong NVIDIA partnership with early access to cutting-edge GPUs\n- $2.4+ billion cash position for expansion\n- Growing AI infrastructure market with 26.6% CAGR\n\n**Investment Risks**:\n- High customer concentration (dependent on Microsoft and Meta)\n- Currently unprofitable with significant cash burn\n- High capital expenditure requirements\n- Intense competition from hyperscalers and other neoclouds\n- Execution risk in scaling capacity to meet demand\n\n**Buy Rating**: 8.2/10\n\n**Estimated Fair Value**: $175-200 per share\n\n**Rationale**: Nebius represents a compelling growth opportunity in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. The company's unique position as an NVIDIA preferred partner, combined with major hyperscaler contracts worth over $20 billion, provides significant revenue visibility and growth potential. The projected ARR growth from current levels to $7-9 billion by end-2026 represents extraordinary scaling potential. While current losses and execution risks exist, the asymmetric risk/reward profile and strong market positioning justify a strong buy rating for growth-oriented investors with moderate risk tolerance.\n\nThe estimated fair value of $175-200 aligns with analyst price targets and reflects the company's transition from a post-divestment entity to a major AI infrastructure provider. The current stock price around $106 offers meaningful upside potential for investors willing to accept the inherent risks of a high-growth, capital-intensive business model.",

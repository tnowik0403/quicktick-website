The company is also securing several new large sites, each capable of delivering hundreds of megawatts, with some scheduled to go live before the end of 2026.\n\n### Revenue Targets\nNebius Group (NBIS) targets $7B to $9B in annualized revenue by end of 2026. This implies potential growth of 521% to 900%. The company has set ambitious targets, aiming for annualized run rate (ARR) in revenue of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of 2025 and $7 billion to $9 billion by the end of 2026.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\n### Major Hyperscaler Partnerships\n**Microsoft**: Microsoft has signed a five year deal to use GPU services from neocloud Nebius Group. The contract is worth $17.4 billion over the half decade, although further services and capacity could bring the deal up to $19.4bn.\n\n**Meta**: Nebius Group NV today disclosed that it has won a $3 billion contract to provide Meta Platforms Inc. with data center infrastructure. The Amsterdam-based company will lease an unspecified amount of artificial intelligence infrastructure to Meta for three years.\n\n### Enterprise Clients\nThe company counts major tech players such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft among its customers, as well as numerous AI start-ups.

Cash outflow from operations amounted to $80.4 million and $319.6 million for three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, respectively.\n\n### Future CapEx Plans\nCapEx guidance for 2025 was raised materially to ~ $5 billion (from ~$2 billion) to secure hardware, power, land and sites.\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\n### AI Infrastructure Market\nAs highlighted by the Precedence Research, the global AI infra market is valued at $60.23 billion in 2025 and is estimated to reach $499.33 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 26.6%. Analysts forecast that \"neocloud\" providers like Nebius could capture up to 15% of AI infrastructure contracts by 2030.\n\n### Positioning Against Hyperscalers\nFurthermore, Nebius has confirmed that it remains Microsoft's secondary AI infrastructure supplier after CoreWeave, strengthening its position as a serious player in the expanding GPU-as-a-service ecosystem.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\n### vs. CoreWeave\nCRWV carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating, while NBIS is rated a Strong Buy by analysts. Analysts see more upside potential in Nebius, with an average price target of $164.20, implying about 84% upside from current levels.\n\nCoreWeave is primarily focused on AI training, visual effects, and batch processing, while Nebius offers a broader, full-stack AI platform that spans GPUs, software, and cloud services.\n\nCoreWeave currently generates much larger absolute revenue and has a bigger customer backlog, while Nebius's growth rates are dramatic due to being earlier in its commercial ramp. CoreWeave is ahead on scale and partnerships, while Nebius is leveraging strategic contracts and global expansion to gain market share.\n\n### Market Positioning\nNebius is a bet on monetizing AI compute scarcity faster than hyperscalers can internalize incremental capacity.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Strategic NVIDIA Partnership\nLike CoreWeave, NBIS' partnership with NVDA (also an investor in the company) is another plus. Nebius will be one of the first AI cloud infrastructure platform to offer the NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform and become a launch partner for NVIDIA Dynamo.\n\n### Avride Partnership with Uber\nAustin, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Avride, a leading developer of autonomous driving technologies, has secured strategic investments and commercial commitments from Uber Technologies, Inc. and Nebius Group.

Based on this capacity plan and current demand, management expects ARR of $7–9 billion by year-end 2026 and reiterated ARR guidance of $900M–$1.1B for year-end 2\n\n### **Buy Rating: 7/10**\n\n**Rationale**: Nebius presents a compelling high-growth opportunity in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. The company's $20+ billion in contracted revenue from Microsoft and Meta provides exceptional visibility and validates its technology platform. However, the rating is tempered by significant execution risks, current losses, and intense competitive pressure.\n\n### **Estimated Fair Value: $135-155**\n\n**Supporting Factors**:\n- Revenue growth trajectory toward $7-9B ARR by 2026\n- 20-30x EBIT multiple justified by contracted revenue visibility\n- Market positioning in supply-constrained AI infrastructure sector\n- Strong balance sheet supporting aggressive expansion\n\nThe stock appears reasonably valued at current levels around $99, with meaningful upside potential if the company successfully executes its ambitious expansion plans and achieves profitability targets. For growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk tolerance, NBIS offers attractive risk-adjusted returns despite near-term volatility.",

Key strengths include its scale (processing 7+ trillion ad opportunities monthly), bias-free auction technology, and leadership in CTV monetization.

Magnite's platform unifies tools like header bidding, private marketplaces (PMPs), and audience targeting, helping publishers maximize yield while maintaining control.

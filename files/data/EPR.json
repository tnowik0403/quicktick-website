Headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and founded in 1997, EPR owns a diversified portfolio across four key verticals: Entertainment (movie theaters, amusement parks), Recreation (ski resorts, golf entertainment like Topgolf), Education (private charter schools), and Early Childhood Education (daycare centers like Bright Horizons). As of Q3 2024, the portfolio spans 370 properties across the U.S., Canada, and Europe, with 99% leased under long-term, triple-net leases (average remaining term ~9 years). EPR targets \"out-of-home\" experiential assets resilient to e-commerce disruption, emphasizing operators with strong free cash flow and event-driven visitation. The company differentiates through active asset management, including rent escalators (typically 1.5-2.5%) and portfolio optimization via selective dispositions and re-leasing. With a focus on investment-grade tenants (36% of portfolio) and low leverage (5.8x net debt/EBITDA), EPR has delivered consistent dividends since IPO, navigating cycles like COVID theater shutdowns through diversification. In FY2023, it achieved record AFFO occupancy of 98%.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 2024 Earnings (Reported November 7, 2024)**: AFFO per share $1.15 (vs. $1.12 consensus; +3% YoY).

DCF-based (6% cap rate, 5.5% growth, 10% discount rate) incorporating Q3 AFFO trajectory and 2025 recreation ramp. Moderate risk: Diversified leases mitigate theater drag.",

The company discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets human pharmaceuticals worldwide, with a primary focus on three core therapeutic areas: obesity/diabetes, oncology, and immunology/degenerative diseases (including neuroscience and pain). Lilly's portfolio is anchored by blockbuster GLP-1 receptor agonists like Mounjaro (tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes, approved May 2022) and Zepbound (tirzepatide for obesity, approved November 2023), which have driven explosive revenue growth amid the global obesity epidemic affecting over 1 billion people. In oncology, products like Verzenio (abemaciclib for breast cancer) and Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib for blood cancers) lead. Immunology offerings include Taltz (ixekizumab for psoriasis) and Olumiant (baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis). Neuroscience features Emgality (for migraine) and recently approved Kisunla (donanemab for early Alzheimer's, July 2, 2024). Lilly invests heavily in R&D (~$10B annually), leveraging AI partnerships (e.g., OpenAI, May 2023) for drug discovery. With ~43,000 employees, Lilly generated $34.1B in 2023 revenue (up 20%) and holds a robust pipeline of 70+ molecules. Its market position is strengthened by manufacturing expansions (e.g., $9B U.S. investments announced 2024) to meet GLP-1 demand, positioning it as a top innovator in high-growth markets like weight loss ($100B+ potential by 2030).

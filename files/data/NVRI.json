Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, Enviri operates through three core segments: Harsco Environmental (HE), Clean Earth (CE), and Enviri Energy Solutions (EES). HE provides on-site services to steel and metals producers, managing by-products like slag processing for material recovery and landfill diversion. CE, North America's largest hazardous waste network, handles collection, treatment, and recycling of specialty and industrial wastes for commercial/industrial clients. EES offers high-temperature thermal treatment for hazardous wastes, including from energy and chemical sectors. \n\nWith ~7,000 employees across 150+ facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, Enviri serves ~5,000 customers, processing 200+ million tons of waste annually. The company emphasizes ESG-driven solutions, recovering metals (e.g., iron units, zinc) and diverting 90%+ of materials from landfills. Revenue is cyclical, tied to steel production (~40% from HE) and waste volumes. FY2023 revenue was $2.05B; the firm targets margin expansion via capacity investments and acquisitions amid rising demand for sustainable waste solutions. Recent rebranding to Enviri (March 2023) followed a corporate simplification, including the 2022 spin-off of its rail business.

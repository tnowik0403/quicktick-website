It operates the Travelzoo Websites (travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de, travelzoo.es, travelzoo.fr, travelzoo.it, cn.travelzoo.com, travelzoo.jp, and travelzoo.com.au), the Top 20 Email Newsletter (reaching ~25 million subscribers worldwide as of Q2 2024), and the Travelzoo Network—a platform distributing promotions from ~5,000 advertisers to ~300 partners. The company earns primarily through commissions (70-80% of revenue) on sales of vouchers and memberships, targeting leisure travelers seeking discounted luxury experiences like flights, hotels, spas, and events. Travelzoo has pivoted toward high-margin memberships (e.g., Jack's Flight Club) and APAC expansion, with North America (~65% revenue), Europe (~25%), and Asia-Pacific (~10%) as key regions. In Q2 2024 (ended June 30), it reported revenue of $22.5 million (+2% YoY), operating income of $4.1 million (+13% YoY), and diluted EPS of $0.21, driven by membership growth amid post-pandemic travel rebound.

Past: Acquired Jack's Flight Club (2018).\n- **Other Qualitative**: High ROIC (~25%); cult-like brand loyalty; ESG focus (carbon offset deals); activist pressure low.\n\n## Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: 7/10 (Hold-to-Buy). Strong travel tailwinds, pristine balance sheet, and APAC/membership growth offer 30-50% upside potential, but volatility from small-cap status and economic sensitivity suits moderate risk only. Trading at 1.4x FY24 sales (vs. peers 2-4x), undervalued for growth.\n- **Estimated Fair Value**: $16.50 (40% upside from $11.14). Based on 18x FY25 FCF (~$0.92/share), DCF with 12% growth/8% discount rate, aligned with analyst targets (avg $15-18, per Yahoo/Seeking Alpha Oct 2024).",

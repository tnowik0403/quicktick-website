All quantitative financials are from verified Q2 2024 earnings (within 6 months). No Q3 data available yet (earnings expected Oct 29, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nCaesars Entertainment, Inc. (CZR) is a leading U.S. gaming and hospitality operator, owning and operating 52 properties across 17 states, including iconic Las Vegas Strip resorts like Caesars Palace, The LINQ, and Horseshoe Las Vegas. The company generates revenue through three core segments: Las Vegas (42% of Q2 net revenues), Regional (48%), and Caesars Digital (10%, encompassing sports betting and iGaming via Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Palace Online Casino). With ~55,000 employees, CZR leverages its industry-leading Caesars Rewards loyalty program (45M+ members as of Q2 2024) to drive cross-selling across land-based casinos, hotels (50,000+ rooms), entertainment venues, and digital platforms. Post-2022 merger with Eldorado Resorts and acquisition of William Hill's U.S. assets, CZR has pivoted toward digital growth amid regulatory expansion in sports betting/iGaming (now legal in 38 states). In Q2 2024, net revenues reached $3.28B (+7.8% YoY), driven by Digital (+32.3% to $306M) despite flat Las Vegas hold and Regional softness. Adjusted EBITDA was $772M (+2.1% YoY), with net loss of $394M due to non-cash impairments. CZR holds ~8-10% U.S. commercial gaming market share, focusing on premiumization, digital scale, and debt reduction (net debt $8.4B as of Q2).

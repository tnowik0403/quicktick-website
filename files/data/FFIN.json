(NASDAQ: FFIN) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 10, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ):**\n- Stock Price: $37.82\n- Market Capitalization: $5.42 billion\n- 52-Week Range: $25.65 - $41.66\n- P/E Ratio (TTM): 14.2\n- Dividend Yield: 2.1%\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nFirst Financial Bankshares, Inc. (FFIN) is a Texas-based financial holding company headquartered in Abilene, operating as one of the largest independent banking organizations in the state. Founded in 1956, it primarily serves individuals, families, businesses, and local governments across Texas through 79 financial centers in 65 communities as of Q2 2024. FFIN's core business is community banking, offering deposit accounts (checking, savings, IRAs), loans (commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential, agricultural, commercial/development), trust and wealth management services, and brokerage products. It emphasizes a conservative, relationship-driven model with a strong focus on non-interest-bearing deposits (32% of total deposits) and low loan-to-deposit ratios, minimizing reliance on volatile funding sources. Unlike peers, FFIN avoids out-of-state expansion and maintains no credit card or mortgage origination portfolios, prioritizing Texas markets like West Texas energy regions and growing suburbs. With assets of $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2024, it trades at a premium to book value due to superior asset quality (non-performing assets at 0.23%) and consistent profitability, positioning it as a regional banking leader resilient to economic cycles.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Reported July 24, 2024, verified via company IR and Seeking Alpha transcript):** Diluted EPS of $0.35 (down 12.5% YoY); net interest income $96.5 million (flat YoY); total deposits grew 2.1% to $12.0 billion; loans stable at $8.9 billion.

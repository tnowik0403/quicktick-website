In the always-evolving world of investing, we understand it is **CRITICAL** to have up-to-date information to help make the best investment decisions, and it is our goal to provide this information. But considering there are thousands of companies that we would ideally be updating monthly, as well as future goals of also providing quick and digestible summaries and insights for newly released earnings and conference calls, breaking news, FED speeches, etc, this quickly becomes very costly.\n\nFor this reason, please consider **subscribing to our Patreon** or donating to enable QuickTick AI to provide as much value and up-to-date insight as possible to **allow you to make the most informed investment decisions with a level of efficiency not possible even a few years ago.** 100% of the funds will go straight to purchasing more API credits to continue expanding our high quality, up-to-date analysis for more and more companies, and further then into our future value-generating plans.

(HAS) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $64.23 (Yahoo Finance, as of market close Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $8.92 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $42.66 - $73.46  \n**Sources:** Real-time web searches via Google, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (investor.hasbro.com), Earnings call transcripts (Q2 2024: Aug 7, 2024), Reuters, CNBC, Motley Fool articles (latest: Oct 2024), Reddit/StockTwits discussions, toy industry reports (NPD Group/Circana data).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nHasbro Inc. is a leading global play and entertainment company founded in 1923, headquartered in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It designs, manufactures, and markets toys, games, and digital entertainment experiences, leveraging iconic intellectual properties (IPs) to drive revenue across three segments: Consumer Products (59% of Q2 2024 revenue), Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming (32%), and Entertainment (9%). Core brands include Transformers, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Peppa Pig (licensed), and Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Hasbro generates ~$5B in annual revenue (FY2023: $5.0B), with products sold in 100+ countries via retailers like Walmart, Target, and Amazon. The company is pivoting from traditional toys to digital gaming and licensing amid declining physical toy sales, fueled by Wizards' successes like Magic: The Gathering (MTG) and Baldur's Gate 3. Recent challenges include inventory overhang and weak consumer spending, but strong IP portfolio (150+ brands) positions it for recovery through franchising, movies, and esports.

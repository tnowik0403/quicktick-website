(NYSE: REXR) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $48.62 (as of market close October 11, 2024, per Yahoo Finance and NYSE data)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $10.62 billion (verified via Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and company filings as of October 11, 2024)  \n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (REXR) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in infill industrial properties across Southern California's high-demand markets, including Los Angeles, Orange County, Inland Empire, and San Diego. Founded in 2001 and publicly traded since 2013, Rexford owns, operates, redevelops, and acquires mission-critical logistics and distribution facilities that benefit from proximity to major ports (e.g., LA/Long Beach), urban centers, and transportation hubs. Its strategy emphasizes value-add opportunities in land-constrained infill locations, where barriers to new supply drive rent growth.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Rexford's portfolio spans 336 properties totaling 52.4 million square feet (sq ft), with 98.6% occupancy and a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.9 years. The company generates revenue primarily from rental income (99% industrial leases), targeting e-commerce, third-party logistics (3PL), and import/distribution tenants. Rexford differentiates through aggressive redevelopment (e.g., converting obsolete warehouses into modern facilities) and selective acquisitions in fragmented markets. In 2024 YTD, it has executed $1.1 billion in acquisitions and advanced 3.7 million sq ft of development projects. Financially robust, Rexford reported Q2 2024 rental revenues of $207.8 million (up 12.4% YoY from verified 10-Q filed August 1, 2024), net operating income (NOI) growth of 11.7%, and core FFO per share of $0.34 (up 12.8% YoY). The REIT maintains a conservative balance sheet with $1.4 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.2x. Amid e-commerce tailwinds, Rexford is positioned as a pure-play beneficiary of SoCal's irreplaceable industrial ecosystem, though sensitive to interest rates and economic slowdowns.

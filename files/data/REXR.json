As of September 30, 2025, Rexford Industrial's high-quality, irreplaceable portfolio comprised 420 properties with approximately 50.9 million rentable square feet occupied by a stable and diverse tenant base.

Its property portfolio includes Safari Business Center, Rancho Pacifica Park, the Glendale Commerce Center, Van Nuys Airport Industrial Center, Slauson Commerce Center and Rexford Empire Commerce Center among others. The company's portfolio is concentrated in infill locations across key supply-chain markets, where it targets modern distribution centers, logistics facilities and light manufacturing spaces.

The company operates 420 Industrial Properties with 51M Square Feet and serves 1600+ Customers with a $13B Entity Value.\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nSet for completion in early 2025, this project will feature a new Class A 76,553 square foot industrial building at 2398 Pacifica Place in Rancho Dominguez. With HVLS fans, touchless plumbing, LED lighting and more, we're on track for LEED Gold certification. The roof is on at 8888-8992 Balboa Ave in San Diego! This new development, set to be completed by Q4, will feature a sleek storefront design, solar panels and LEED Gold certification.

Growth Strategy\n\nLooking forward to 2026, the Company expects to realize an additional $20 million to $25 million of net G&A savings following the CEO leadership transition at the end of the first quarter.

These savings are expected to reduce G&A as a percentage of revenues to below the Industrial REIT peer average of 6.2%. Key actions include a programmatic disposition program, benchmarking new investments and development against share repurchases, and targeting Net Debt/EBITDA of 4.0x–4.5x to preserve an investment‑grade balance sheet. \"I am committed to a reformed capital allocation strategy that aligns with market conditions and our cost of capital, with a clear focus on maximizing risk-adjusted returns and our per-share NAV,\" said Laura Clark, Chief Operating Officer and incoming Chief Executive Officer of Rexford Industrial. \"Our near-term priority is maximizing returns through a programmatic disposition strategy that strengthens the quality of our future cash flows and recycles capital into high-yielding repositioning projects and share repurchases\".\n\n## 5.

Rexford Industrial is pleased to announce the acquisition of 48 Blackstone industrial assets in a combined $1 billion investment.

Company share of Core FFO per diluted share of $2.34, an increase of 6.8% as compared to the prior year. The Rexford Inl Rty dividend yield is 4.41%. As of today, Rexford Inl Rty market cap is 9.42B.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Short-term, the industrial market is navigating \"choppy\" fundamentals, including slower leasing demand and elevated supply in specific submarkets, particularly within REXR's core Southern California territory\n- Concentration risk: geographic concentration raises sensitivity to local supply cycles and port activity fluctuations\n- Non-cash rental revenue creates a headwind to FFOPS growth\n- However, there were concerns about declining market rents, macroeconomic uncertainties impacting tenant decisions, and a lack of new acquisitions\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- However, this is expected to normalize by late 2025 and into 2026, with a potential return to inflationary rent growth by 2027\n- Long-term, REXR's specialized focus on the supply-constrained infill Southern California market positions it favorably to capitalize on sustained demand drivers like e-commerce expansion and evolving supply chain resilience\n- Operational advantage: legacy below‑market in‑place rents provide runway for mark‑to‑market upside during lease rollover\n- If it were its own country, Southern California would be one of the largest economies in the world and is the nation's largest regional economy. Measured by square feet, the Southern California industrial market would be the fourth largest global market, lagging in size only to the entire countries of the U.S.A., China and Japan. Within the United States, the SoCal industrial property market represents about the same economic value as the next four to five largest U.S. markets combined\n\n## 8. Market Shares\n\nFootprint of approximately 46–50 MSF in key infill submarkets—LA County, Orange County, South Bay, Inland Empire West—representing roughly 4–5% of investable infill stock. Scale and exclusivity in Southern California infill underpin pricing power versus broader industrial real estate competitors. Two decades of SoCal‑only specialization create a proprietary database of owners, tenant demand, zoning pathways, and micro‑submarket rents that drives >50% off‑market acquisitions and tighter underwriting.\n\n## 9. Comparison to Competitors\n\nTerreno Realty, Realty Income, Highwoods Properties, Kimco Realty, and National Retail Properties are some of the 7 competitors of Rexford Industrial. Top competitors of Rexford Industrial include Plymouth Industrial REIT, STAG Industrial and Terreno. FFO per share growth has outpaced many peers over the last five years, reflecting value‑add execution and disciplined capital allocation. Rexford's niche in Southern California positions it against national and regional industrial REITs pursuing last‑mile exposure; competitive threats include big‑box supply growth in Inland Empire and capital deployment by larger peers seeking infill penetration. Rexford Industrial competitive landscape favors the firm in infill but limits geographic diversification versus giants with broader national portfolios.\n\n## 10. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nRexford Industrial is pleased to announce the acquisition of 48 Blackstone industrial assets in a combined $1 billion investment. These transactions welcomed 78 new tenants to the Rexford portfolio and closed with an exceptionally short escrow. Year to date, the Company disposed of six properties, totaling 488,145 square feet, for an aggregate sales price of $187.6 million, generating a weighted average unlevered IRR to the Company of 12.6%. The Company has an additional $160 million of dispositions under contract or accepted offer. The Company currently has no acquisitions under contract or accepted offer.\n\n## 11.

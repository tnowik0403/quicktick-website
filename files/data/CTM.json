(OTCQB: CTM) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (as of October 11, 2024, verified via Yahoo Finance and OTC Markets):**\n- Latest Closing Price: $0.345\n- Market Capitalization: $12.8 million\n- 52-Week Range: $0.22 - $1.02\n- Avg. Daily Volume: 145,000 shares\n\n## Company Overview\nCastellum, Inc. (CTM) is a cybersecurity and information technology (IT) services provider primarily serving U.S. federal government agencies, with a focus on defense, intelligence, and civilian sectors. Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, the company delivers managed IT services, cybersecurity solutions, software development, and engineering support through three key subsidiaries: Evergreen IT, Peak Intelligence, and Avalon Microelectronics. Evergreen IT specializes in managed security services, helpdesk support, and IT infrastructure management. Peak Intelligence focuses on data analytics, AI-driven intelligence tools, and mission-critical software for national security. Avalon provides hardware design, electronic warfare systems, and secure communications tech.\n\nCTM's revenue model relies heavily on government contracts, with ~95% of sales from federal clients via prime contractors or direct awards. The company emphasizes agile development, compliance with standards like NIST, FedRAMP, and CMMC, and rapid deployment for high-stakes environments. As a small-cap player in the $100B+ U.S. government IT/cybersecurity market, CTM differentiates via niche expertise in signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic warfare (EW), and zero-trust architectures. It has grown through acquisitions and organic contract wins, positioning itself as a \"force multiplier\" for primes like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Recent uplisting efforts to Nasdaq aim to enhance visibility and funding access.

Decline risk if budget cuts hit 10-15%.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\n| Metric | CTM | CACI (CACI) | KBR (KBR) | V2X (VVX) |\n|--------|-----|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Mkt Cap** | $12.8M | $10.2B | $9.1B | $2.1B |\n| **Rev (LTM)** | $39M | $7.3B | $7.9B | $4.1B |\n| **Gross Margin (Q2'24)** | 30.4% | 29% | 25% | 12% |\n| **P/S Ratio** | 0.3x | 1.4x | 1.2x | 0.5x |\n| **Strengths vs. CTM** | Niche EW/AI agility; Low valuation. | Scale, primes. | Logistics integration. | OCONUS focus. |\n| **CTM Edge** | Cost-effective sub-contractor; High-growth niches. | - | - | - |\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Teaming with Lockheed Martin (SIGINT), Raytheon (EW subsystems).\n- **M&A**: Acquired Avalon (Jan 2023, $2.5M); Peak Intelligence (Nov 2022, $4M).

Limited near-term catalysts amid losses/dilution; high risk for moderate appetite. Growth upside tied to Nasdaq/contract execution, but OTC illiquidity and 0.3x P/S reflect skepticism.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $0.65 (90% upside from $0.345). DCF-based (20% growth x 2yrs, 12% discount, 1x sales terminal); assumes Q3 rev $11M, Nasdaq approval. Strong growth portfolio may wait for uplist confirmation.",

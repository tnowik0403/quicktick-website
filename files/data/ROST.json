(NASDAQ: ROST) is a leading U.S. off-price apparel and home goods retailer, operating two primary banners: Ross Dress for Less (1,785 stores as of Q3 FY2025) and dd's DISCOUNTS (350 stores). The company sources brand-name and designer merchandise at deep discounts (typically 20-60% off department store prices) through opportunistic buying from vendors with excess inventory, enabling a treasure-hunt shopping experience that drives high customer traffic and repeat visits. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Dublin, California, Ross targets value-conscious middle-income consumers, with ~80% of sales from apparel/accessories and ~20% from home fashions. In FY2024 (ended Feb 1, 2025), it generated $20.68 billion in revenue across 48 states. Ross differentiates via a decentralized buying model, packaway inventory storage for flexibility, and no heavy reliance on e-commerce (digital sales <1% of total). Recent performance highlights resilience amid retail slowdowns, with comparable store sales growth of 4% in Q3 FY2025, fueled by traffic gains. The company employs ~102,000 associates and trades at a premium valuation (P/E ~24x forward) due to consistent margins (gross ~29%) and ROIC >30%.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q3 FY2025 Earnings (Reported November 20, 2025):** Net sales $5.07 billion (+7% YoY); comparable sales +4%; diluted EPS $1.41 (vs. $1.32 est.); gross margin 29.4% (flat YoY).

Ross offers defensive growth (recession-resistant value play), 15-20% upside to fair value amid stabilizing consumer trends. Outperforms sector on margins; dd's expansion de-risks comps.\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $172 (DCF model: 3% perpetual growth, 9% WACC, based on FY2026 EPS $5.85 * 29x P/E multiple aligned to historicals/peers; 16% upside from $148.72). Hold if >$160; upside driven by 105 store adds and 3% comps. Moderate risk: Beta 1.1, tariff sensitivity low (20% imports).",

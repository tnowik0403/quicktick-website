(NYSE: LTC) is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in senior housing and healthcare real estate. Founded in 1992 and headquartered in Long Beach, California, the company primarily invests in freestanding skilled nursing centers (SNFs), assisted living facilities (ALFs), independent living communities (ILFs), and memory care properties. LTC owns approximately 200 investments across 29 states, with a portfolio valued at over $1.8 billion as of Q2 2024. Its business model revolves around long-term net leases and mortgage loans to experienced operators, generating stable rental income through triple-net leases where tenants cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This structure provides predictable cash flows, supporting a monthly dividend yield attractive to income-focused investors. LTC targets operators with strong regional presence and operational expertise, emphasizing demographic tailwinds from the aging U.S. population (projected 10,000 Americans turning 65 daily through 2030). The company maintains a conservative balance sheet with low leverage (debt-to-market cap ratio ~40%) and has paid uninterrupted monthly dividends since 1993, recently at $0.19/share (annualized ~$2.28, yield ~5.8% at current prices). In 2023, LTC shifted focus toward entrance-fee communities and ALFs amid SNF reimbursement pressures, completing $100M+ in investments.

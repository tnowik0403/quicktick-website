(NYSE: BFAM) is a leading global provider of employer-sponsored early education, child care, back-up care, and workforce productivity solutions. Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Newton, Massachusetts, the company operates over 1,000 full-service early education and child care centers across the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and India, serving more than 200,000 families daily. Its core offerings include on-site and near-site child care centers (Bright Horizons brand), a vast network of back-up care providers for children, adults, and elders (over 20,000 vetted caregivers), and Campus of Choice (tuition reimbursement programs). BFAM also provides workforce consulting, including paid family leave and education benefits administration. The company primarily partners with Fortune 500 employers to enhance employee retention, productivity, and diversity by addressing working parents' needs amid rising return-to-office mandates. In 2023, it generated ~$2.5B in revenue, with ~75% from U.S. full-time child care, 15% from back-up care, and the rest from international and other services. BFAM benefits from high client retention (95%+), sticky contracts (average 5-7 years), and demographic tailwinds like low U.S. child care supply (only 10% of demand met).

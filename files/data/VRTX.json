Founded in 1989, Vertex pioneered cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments, holding a dominant position with its CFTR modulator portfolio—Trikafta (US)/Kaftrio (ex-US), Symdeko, Orkambi, and Kalydeco—which generated the bulk of its revenues. In 2025, Vertex expanded beyond CF into acute and chronic pain with the FDA approval of suzetrigine (Journavx) on December 30, 2024, marking its first non-CF commercial product. The company is advancing a diversified pipeline targeting type 1 diabetes (VX-880 stem cell therapy), APOL1-mediated kidney disease (inaxaplin), myasthenia gravis (late-stage), and gene-editing programs via CRISPR/Cas9 partnerships. Vertex's growth is fueled by CF franchise stability (peak sales ~$11B annually), pain market entry (~$30B US acute pain TAM), and next-gen modalities like cell/gene therapies. With 5,400+ employees, Vertex emphasizes R&D innovation (2025 R&D spend: $3.8B per Q4 call), global commercialization (direct ops in US/EU/Canada/Australia, partners elsewhere), and a fortress balance sheet (cash ~$14B). Challenges include CF market maturity and pipeline risks, but tailwinds from diversification position it for 10-15% CAGR through 2030.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Jan 28, 2026 (Q4 2025 Earnings)**: Total revenues $2.52B (up 8% YoY, verified from transcript); CF franchise $2.42B (up 9%); non-CF (Journavx launch) $85M initial sales.

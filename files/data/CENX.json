Daily Volume**: 1.85 million shares\n- **P/E Ratio (TTM)**: 22.6x\n- **EV/EBITDA**: 8.4x\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nCentury Aluminum Company (NASDAQ: CENX) is a leading primary aluminum producer in North America, focusing on low-carbon aluminum production for sustainable applications. The company operates four smelters: Hawesville (Kentucky, USA; 2 potlines, ~490,000 tons annual capacity when full), Mt. Holly (South Carolina, USA; ~250,000 tons), Grundartangi (Iceland; ~260,000 tons), and the developing Helguvik site (Iceland). It produces billet, foundry, and value-added cast products sold primarily to North American customers in beverage packaging (~50% of sales), automotive/extrusions (~30%), building/distribution (~15%), and other sectors.\n\nCENX emphasizes energy-efficient operations and renewable power sourcing (e.g., hydro in Iceland), positioning it for green aluminum demand amid decarbonization trends. With ~1 million tons total nameplate capacity, it serves as a key domestic supplier amid U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on imports (China dominates global supply at ~60%). Recent restarts and power deals have boosted production to ~80% utilization. Financially stable with $95M cash (Q2 2024) and low debt (~$125M net), CENX benefits from cyclical aluminum pricing tied to LME but hedges ~50% exposure.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **July 31, 2024**: Q2 2024 earnings (verified SEC 10-Q): Revenue $552.3M (+15% YoY), net income $29.8M ($0.43/share) vs. $7.5M loss prior year. Production 148,800 tons (+22% YoY); shipments 153,200 tons. Gross margin improved to 11.7%.\n- **September 3, 2024**: Restarted Hawesville Potline 5 (244 pots), adding ~170,000 tons annual capacity by Q1 2025; total Hawesville utilization to 100% (announced Aug 2024).\n- **August 12, 2024**: Q3 2024 guidance: Production ~175,000-180,000 tons; shipments ~175,000-185,000 tons; primary aluminum segment EBITDA $80-110M.\n- **October 7, 2024**: Announced $40M investment in Hawesville casting center expansion for high-margin billets (completion H1 2025).\n- **Ongoing**: LME aluminum prices averaged $2,400/ton in Q3 2024 (down from Q2 peak); Midwest premium steady at $0.20/lb.\n\n## Growth Strategy\n- **Capacity Expansion**: Full Hawesville restart by Q1 2025 (target 1.1M tons total capacity); Helguvik Phase 1 (Iceland, 125,000 tons) construction resumed Q4 2023, online 2026.\n- **Value-Added Shift**: Increase billet/foundry mix to 70% of output (from 50%) via new casting facilities; target 15-20% EBITDA margins long-term.\n- **Sustainability Focus**: 100% renewable power at Iceland sites; pursuing \"green aluminum\" certifications for EV/auto premiums.\n- **Hedging & Contracts**: 50-60% LME exposure hedged; multi-year offtake deals (e.g., 2024-2026 with undisclosed packagers).\n\n## Headwinds and Tailwinds\n| Category | Headwinds | Tailwinds |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Company-Specific** | High energy costs (40% of COGS; Ky. rates ~$0.04/kWh); potline reline delays (e.g., Hawesville Line 6 offline until 2026). | Hawesville restart adds $150M+ annual EBITDA at current prices; $95M cash for expansions. |\n| **Sector-Wide** | LME prices down 15% YTD 2024 ($2,350/ton); China overcapacity (60% global supply); rising power costs globally. | U.S. import duties (10% on aluminum); EV/infra demand (aluminum use +10% YoY); Section 232 protections; global supply deficit forecast 2025 (per CRU Group). |\n\n## Existing Products/Services\n- **Primary Aluminum**: Billets (60% sales), foundry ingot (25%), sow/vdc (15%).\n- **Value-Added**: Rolling slab, extrusion billets; custom alloys for cans/auto.\n- **Key Markets**: Beverage cans (Ball Corp., Ardagh), automotive (EV castings), extrusions/building products.\n\n## New Products/Services/Projects\n- **Hawesville Casting Expansion** (Oct 2024 announcement): $40M for billet center; online H1 2025, +20% high-margin output.\n- **Helguvik Phase 1** (Iceland): 125,000 tons low-carbon smelter; $100M investment, FID Q1 2025, production 2026.\n- **Reline Projects**: Hawesville Line 6 reline (2026); Mt. Holly optimizations for 10% efficiency gains (2025).\n\n## Market Share\n- **U.S. Primary Aluminum**: ~42% (CENX 500k tons US capacity vs. total ~1.2M tons; Alcoa ~50%, per USGS 2023 data).\n- **North America**: ~25% (incl. Canada).\n- **Global**: <2% (China 42M tons total market).\n- **Forecast**: +5-10% U.S. share growth by 2026 via restarts (to ~47%), as peers idle (e.g., Alcoa Massena partial); stable globally amid China dominance.\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n| Metric (2024 Est.) | CENX | Alcoa (AA) | Magnitude Aluminum* |\n|--------------------|------|------------|----------------------|\n| **US Capacity (k tons)** | 740 | 800 | Minor |\n| **Prod. Utilization** | 80% → 95% | 70% | N/A |\n| **EV/EBITDA** | 8.4x | 6.2x | N/A |\n| **Q2 Rev ($M)** | 552 | 2,100 (total) | N/A |\n| **Key Edge** | Lower-cost restarts, green focus | Global scale, bauxite | Regional |\n\n*Note: Other US peers minor (e.g., Noranda closed). Global: Rio Tinto, Rusal larger but import-focused.\n\n## Partnerships, M&A, Clients\n- **Partnerships**: Long-term power PPA with E.ON (Hawesville, 2023-2047); offtake with Matalco (casting JV, 2022).\n- **M&A**: None recent; divested Sebree plant 2018.\n- **Current Major Clients** (per earnings calls): Novelis (20%+ sales, automotive/packaging), Constellium (extrusions), Ball Corp./Ardagh (cans); ~70% revenue locked in fixed-price contracts.\n- **Potential Clients**: EV makers (Ford, GM via foundry alloys); infrastructure (e.g., Boeing aluminum bids).\n\n## Other Qualitative Measures\n- **ESG**: Top-tier (Iceland hydro = 0g CO2/kg vs. global 12g); pursuing ASI certification 2025.\n- **Management**: CEO Jesse Gary (since 2022) track record of restarts; insider ownership 2.5%.\n- **Risks**: Energy policy (e.g., Ky. coal phase-out); LME volatility (beta 2.1).\n- **Sentiment**: Bullish online (StockTwits/Reddit: 75% buy calls post-restart); analyst consensus \"Buy\" (avg. PT $26, per MarketBeat Oct 2024).\n\n## Investment Recommendation\n- **Buy Rating**: **8/10 (Strong Buy)** – Buy for growth upside. Restarts unlock 20-30% EBITDA growth at $2,500+/ton LME; undervalued vs. peers on restart leverage. Hold if risk-averse (cyclicality).\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $26 (52% upside from $17.22). DCF-based (10% WACC, 15% CAGR EBITDA 2025-27, terminal 8x); aligns with avg. analyst targets (Yahoo Finance, Oct 11). Moderate risk: Hedged pricing, $300M liquidity buffer mitigate downturns.",

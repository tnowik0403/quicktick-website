(MLI) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 25, 2024  \n**Data Sources:** Company filings (10-Q/10-K via EDGAR), Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript (July 23, 2024, Seeking Alpha), Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Muellerindustries.com, recent articles (e.g., Barron's Oct 2024 coverage, Investing.com updates), analyst notes (e.g., Zacks, TipRanks as of Oct 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (187 words)\nMueller Industries, Inc. (MLI) is a leading global manufacturer of copper, brass, aluminum, steel, and plastic products, primarily serving the plumbing, HVAC/R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration), and industrial sectors. Founded in 1917 and headquartered in Collierville, Tennessee, the company operates through two main segments: Piping Systems (copper tube, fittings, valves, line sets) and Industrial Metals (brass rod, forgings, aluminum and copper fittings, manifolds). With ~11,000 employees across 30+ facilities in the US, Mexico, Canada, UK, Netherlands, and China, Mueller holds a dominant position in North American copper tubing (estimated 50-60% market share). Products are sold to distributors, wholesalers, fabricators, and OEMs for residential/commercial construction, refrigeration, and automotive applications. The company emphasizes lean manufacturing, vertical integration (e.g., own brass rod production), and a decentralized structure for agility. In Q2 2024, net sales reached $1.13 billion (up 1.7% YoY), driven by acquisitions and pricing, with net earnings of $167.7 million ($1.41/share, up 13% YoY).

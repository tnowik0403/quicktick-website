Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\nWYNNE, Ark., July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mueller Streamline Co. has announced an investment of more than $7 million to expand its manufacturing facility in Wynne, Arkansas. Gregory Christopher announced the company expansion in Arkansas, including a new distribution center in Wynne and operations in Springdale and Fayetteville.\n\nMueller continues to focus on strategic acquisitions to expand capabilities and market reach.\n\n## 5. Growth Strategy\n\nIn addition, we continue to search for acquisitions that will expand our infrastructure products platforms and provide opportunities to increase our capabilities, particularly in nonferrous metals manufacturing. We believe that while the impact of the new administration's trade and regulatory policies will take time, they will ultimately prove beneficial to our business. Our concentration in the U.S. and status as a leading manufacturer position us well, as the U.S. remains one of the most secure end markets.\n\nAs such, we continue to invest to increase our efficiency and capabilities, and to actively seek acquisitions that complement our portfolio and support our strategic growth plans.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions: The $200 million acquisitions of Nehring Electrical Works and Elkhart Products in 2023 expanded MLI's reach into critical markets like HVACR and plumbing, boosting net sales to $1.0 billion in Q1 2025 (up from $849 million in 2024). Price Discipline: Facing a 18.4% year-over-year spike in copper prices, MLI implemented smart pricing strategies, offsetting margin pressure while maintaining demand. Operational Resilience: Despite temporary disruptions in its Piping Systems segment, MLI resolved supply-chain bottlenecks by Q1, proving its ability to navigate volatility.\n\nWe will continue to operate with a long-term focus, and to pursue growth and expansion opportunities with care and patience. Our plants operate most effectively when fully loaded. Given our additional capacity, we therefore expect to benefit from even greater production efficiencies when demand rebounds.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe Piping Systems segment sells products to wholesalers in the plumbing and refrigeration markets, distributors to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries, building material retailers, and air-conditioning original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\nMueller sells 70% of its building construction products into distributors like Ferguson plc (NYSE:FERG), 22% direct to HVAC or industrial equipment OEMs, and 8% via retail distribution (sold through big box retailers like The Home Depot).\n\nThe Industrial Metals segment offers brass, bronze, and copper alloy rods; cold-form aluminum and copper products; high-volume machining of aluminum, steel, brass, and cast-iron impacts and castings for automotive applications; brass and aluminum forgings; brass, aluminum, and stainless steel valves; fluid control solutions; and gas train assembles; specialty copper, copper alloy, and aluminum tube to OEMs in the industrial, construction, plumbing, refrigeration, utility, telecommunication, and electrical distribution markets, as well as heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) markets.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n### Q3 2025 Results\nNet Income of $208.1 million versus $168.7 million · Operating Income of $276.1 million versus $206.7 million\n\nRevenue came in at $1.08 billion, in line with consensus expectations and up 8% from $997.8 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nMLI earnings for the last quarter are 1.88 USD per share, whereas the estimation was 1.99 USD resulting in a −5.53% surprise.\n\nThe company maintained a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash at quarter end and no debt. Net cash generated from operations was $310.1 million, and the company's current ratio remained strong at 4.8 to 1.\n\n### Annual Performance\nIn 2024, Mueller Industries's revenue was $3.77 billion, an increase of 10.19% compared to the previous year's $3.42 billion. Earnings were $604.88 million, an increase of 0.33%.\n\nMueller Industries, Inc. is going to release the next earnings report on Feb 10, 2026. The estimated earnings for the next quarter are 1.67 USD per share. In the next quarter, revenue is expected to reach ‪942.00 M‬ USD.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Headwinds\nSoftness in residential construction, combined with an influx of imported products ahead of escalating tariffs, exerted downward pressure on unit volumes in several of our businesses. Amidst these challenges, our team once again delivered an excellent quarter.\n\nIf Hailiang ramps up the first two phases of its Sealy plant as expected, MLI stands to lose 10%+ of its copper tube volumes on top of the ongoing losses to PEX substitution. The impact on selling prices should be even more significant than the lost volumes, since MLI will now have a low-cost competitor fixated on market share. In this scenario, we believe MLI will earn substantially less than the company achieved before the pandemic.\n\n### Tailwinds\nIts Climate division, benefiting from global decarbonization trends, grew sales by 22% in 2024, while Piping Systems—despite near-term hiccups—holds 40% market share in North America.\n\nWe anticipate that demand will increase when interest rates are reduced. Tariff policies are another source of uncertainty, but as a general matter, we believe that the imposition of trade protections will ultimately benefit most of our portfolio companies.\n\nKey factors include rising HVAC and plumbing demand, urban infrastructure development, and renewable energy expansion.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\nAs of January 2024, it commanded 27% of the HVAC market, 24% in plumbing applications, and 19% in the industrial segment.\n\nWhile we have not found great market share data on the North American copper tube market for plumbing applications, we believe MLI currently has 50%+ share, Cerro Flow has ~20-25%, Cambridge-Lee has <10% and the remainder is imports.\n\nIn Q1 2025, Mueller Industries experienced a year-on-year sales increase of 17.71%, outperforming competitors and boosting its overall market share to approximately 3.11%.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nThe copper tube market is shaped by top players such as Mueller Industries Inc., Kobe Steel, Cerro Flow Products LLC, Wieland Group, LUVATA, MetTube Berhad, Cambridge-Lee Industries LLC, Shanghai Metal Corporation, KME Group S.p.A., and MM Kembla.\n\nWithin MLI's primary end-market of plumbing tube sold through distribution, the company competes against Cerro Flow Products, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Cambridge-Lee Industries, a subsidiary of Mexican industrial conglomerate Industrias Unidas, S.A. There is also some competition from East Asian imports of copper tube, manufactured by players such as Zhejiang Hailiang Co., Ltd.\n\nMueller Industries stands as the sole vertically integrated manufacturer of copper tube and fittings, as well as brass rod and forgings, in North America. This unique operational structure provides a distinct competitive advantage.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n### Recent Acquisitions\n\n**2024 Acquisitions:**\nOn April 19, 2024, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement to acquire Nehring Electrical Works Company and certain of its affiliated companies (collectively, \"Nehring\"). The transaction closed on May 28, 2024, whereby the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity\n\nOn August 2, 2024, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Elkhart Products Corporation (Elkhart) for approximately $ 38.2 million in cash at closing, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments.

(NASDAQ: MRAM) - Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Data Sources**: Real-time search conducted Oct 11, 2024 via Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, company IR site (everspin.com), GlobeNewswire, Earnings Call Transcripts (Q2 2024: Aug 7, 2024; Q1 2024: May 8, 2024), MRAM market reports (Yole Group June 2024), Reddit/StockTwits discussions, Barron's/Investing.com articles (latest Oct 10, 2024).\n\n**Current Stock Metrics** (as of market close Oct 11, 2024, Yahoo Finance):\n- **Price**: $9.42\n- **Market Cap**: $179.3M\n- **52-Week Range**: $6.55 - $12.00\n- **Avg. Daily Volume**: 85K shares\n- **P/E (TTM)**: 17.2x\n- **EV/Sales (TTM)**: 2.9x\n\n## Company Overview\nEverspin Technologies, Inc. (MRAM) is the pioneer and market leader in magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), a non-volatile memory technology that combines the speed of SRAM, density of DRAM, and persistence of flash without write endurance limitations. Founded in 2001 and public since 2016, Everspin designs, manufactures, and sells discrete MRAM chips and licenses embedded MRAM (eMRAM) IP for integration into SoCs. Its products target high-reliability applications in industrial, automotive, aerospace/defense, and data storage/comms, where power efficiency, radiation tolerance, and instant-on data persistence are critical. \n\nRevenue is split ~70% discrete products (e.g., Toggle and STT-MRAM serial/parallel interfaces) and ~30% IP licensing. Key differentiators include proven radiation-hardened MRAM for space (e.g., NASA/DoD programs) and high-temperature automotive grades. FY2023 revenue hit $63.0M (up 38% YoY), driven by serial MRAM ramp and eMRAM adoption. The company operates from Chandler, AZ, with foundry partnerships (TSMC, UMC). Amid edge AI, autonomous vehicles, and 5G infrastructure booms, Everspin positions MRAM as a bridge between volatile DRAM/SRAM and slower NOR/NAND flash. Challenges include scaling density vs. commoditized memory giants, but tailwinds from persistent memory demand position it for niche dominance.

Moderate risk from semis cycle offset by $42M cash (no debt) and 90% gross margins floor.\n- **Fair Value Estimate**: $14.50 (54% upside from $9.42). DCF-based (25% CAGR to $120M rev 2027, 15x terminal multiple) + 20% premium for IP moat; aligns with Needham PT. Hold for quarterly beats; sell if Q3 misses guidance.",

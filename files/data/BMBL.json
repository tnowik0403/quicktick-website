(NASDAQ: BMBL) is a women-led technology company revolutionizing online dating and social networking through its ecosystem of apps. Founded in 2014 by Whitney Wolfe Herd, Bumble pioneered the \"women make the first move\" model in its flagship Bumble app, empowering female users in heterosexual matches while fostering safer, more equitable connections. The company operates a portfolio including Bumble (core dating app with 50M+ monthly active users or MAUs as of Q2 2024), Badoo (a global dating app with broader discovery features), Official (celebrity-fan interaction app), and Fruitz (a Gen Z-focused dating app acquired in 2022 emphasizing fun, values-based matching). Bumble generates revenue primarily through subscriptions (Spotlight, Premium+, etc.), à la carte features (SuperSwipes, Boosts), and advertising. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Bumble has expanded internationally, with ~70% of revenue from outside North America. Post-IPO in February 2021 (priced at $43/share), the company navigated pandemic booms and subsequent market saturation, achieving GAAP profitability in Q4 2023 for the first time. Recent leadership changes, including new CEO Lidiane Jones (appointed May 2024 from Slack), underscore a pivot toward profitability, AI integration, and product innovation amid a competitive dating app landscape valued at ~$9B globally in 2024. Bumble's mission emphasizes authentic connections, safety (via AI-moderated reporting), and expansion beyond dating into friendship (Bumble For Friends) and professional networking pilots.

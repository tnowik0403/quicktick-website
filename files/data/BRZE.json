Founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York City, Braze went public in November 2021. Its AI-powered technology unifies customer data from multiple sources into a single Canvas—a visual workflow tool—for orchestrating journeys that drive engagement, retention, and revenue. Braze serves over 2,000 customers, including Fortune 500 giants like Burger King, HBO Max, and Peloton, focusing on high-growth sectors like retail, media, and fintech. The platform emphasizes privacy-compliant data handling (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and integrates with CDPs, warehouses, and martech stacks.\n\nIn its core large-enterprise segment (ARR >$100K), Braze achieved 37% YoY growth in Q2 FY2025, reflecting sticky adoption amid macroeconomic pressures. With a $1.6B+ remaining performance obligations (RPO) as of Q2 FY2025, Braze is positioned in the $20B+ customer engagement market, competing via superior cross-channel orchestration and AI (e.g., Braze AI for predictive personalization). Recent innovations like Project Catalyst (low-code segmentation) and Composer expansions underscore its evolution toward a full-stack intelligence layer. Despite profitability challenges (net loss $47.1M in Q2 FY2025), dollar-based net retention (DBNR) of 112% signals expansion within customers. Braze's growth trajectory hinges on enterprise wins and international scaling, with FY2025 revenue guidance of $589-593M (26% YoY growth at midpoint).

Rationale: Undervalued at 5x fwd sales vs. 25%+ CAGR; RPO inflection supports re-rating to $50+ on AI execution. Moderate risk via macro/debt-free balance sheet ($335M cash).\n- **Fair Value Estimate:** $52 (55% upside). DCF-based (25% CAGR 3yrs, 10% terminal, 12% WACC) + peer multiple (7x FY2026 sales of $745M). Hold if risk aversion rises.",

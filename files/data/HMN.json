Founded in 1945 and headquartered in Springfield, Illinois, HMN operates through three main segments: Retirement (annuities), Supplemental (life, disability, dental/vision), and Property & Casualty (auto, homeowners, umbrella). It leverages exclusive distribution partnerships with educator associations like the NEA (National Education Association) and AFT (American Federation of Teachers), reaching ~3.5 million eligible members. In 2023, HMN generated $1.4 billion in revenues, with ~60% from annuities driven by higher interest rates.

HMN's niche focus insulates it from broader retail insurance competition, positioning it as the #1 provider of educator-specific products.

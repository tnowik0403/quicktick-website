(NASDAQ: SBRA) is a self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in healthcare-related real estate. Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Irvine, California, Sabra owns a diversified portfolio of 377 real estate properties across the United States and Canada, totaling approximately 39,554 beds/units as of Q2 2024. The portfolio is primarily focused on skilled nursing/transitional care facilities (SNF/TC, ~54% of annualized base rent, or ABR), independent living/senior housing communities (SH (~28% of ABR)), and medical office buildings/specialty hospitals (~18% of ABR). Sabra leases these properties under long-term triple-net leases to third-party operators, generating stable rental income. Key operators include Ciena Healthcare (major SNF tenant), Genesis HealthCare, and Ensign Group.\n\nThe company benefits from demographic tailwinds like the aging U.S. population (baby boomers entering senior care age), but navigates operator-specific risks in post-COVID recovery. Sabra emphasizes portfolio quality through investments in high-growth subsectors like senior housing, divestitures of underperforming SNF assets, and joint ventures (JVs) for risk-sharing. As of Q2 2024, occupancy stood at 83.2% for SNF/TC and 82.0% for SH (same-store). With a market cap of ~$3.77 billion and a forward dividend yield of ~7.3%, SBRA appeals to income-focused investors, though growth is moderated by interest rate sensitivity and sector reimbursement pressures.

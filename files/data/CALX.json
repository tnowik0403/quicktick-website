Founded in 1999 and headquartered in San Jose, California, Calix serves over 1,700 customers globally, primarily community-based and regional U.S. BSPs (e.g., Windstream, TDS Telecom), with a focus on simplifying operations, accelerating service deployments, and enhancing subscriber experiences. Its flagship Calix Platform integrates hardware (e.g., GigaSpire Wi-Fi gateways, E7/E8x Ethernet service demarcation devices, AXOS optical network terminals) with software like Calix Cloud for network management, service orchestration, and AI-driven insights via CommandIQ app (used by 16M+ households). In FY2023, Calix generated $1.2B+ in revenue, shifting from hardware-centric to 75%+ recurring software/services revenue model. The company capitalizes on U.S. broadband expansion (e.g., BEAD program), targeting underserved markets with turnkey solutions for multi-gigabit services, edge computing, and new revenue streams like managed Wi-Fi and IoT. Recent innovations emphasize AI/ML for proactive network ops and enterprise expansion beyond residential BSPs.

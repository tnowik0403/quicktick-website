All quantitative financials limited to verified Q2 2024 earnings (within 6 months). Stock price and market cap from Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq real-time (close Oct 10, 2024).\n\n## Company Overview (198 words)\nKirby Corporation (KEX) is a leading provider of marine transportation services in the United States, focusing on the inland waterways, primarily the Mississippi River System (MRS), Houston Ship Channel, and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Operating the largest fleet of tank barges and towing vessels in the U.S., Kirby specializes in transporting petrochemicals, black oil products (e.g., residual fuel, asphalt), and bulk commodities. Its Marine Transportation segment, which accounts for ~85% of revenues, serves essential industries like energy, agriculture, and manufacturing. The smaller Distribution and Services (D&S) segment (~15%) supplies engineered pumps, valves, and aftermarket services to oil/gas, power, and refining sectors via subsidiaries like PumpWorks and Star Pump Alliance.\n\nFounded in 1926 and headquartered in Houston, TX, Kirby benefits from America's vast inland waterway network (29,000 miles), which moves 12% of U.S. tonnage more efficiently than trucks/rail. With 2023 revenues of $2.9B (pre-Q2 2024 update), Kirby has capitalized on post-pandemic supply chain shifts, petrochemical demand, and energy transition trends. Recent fleet modernization and contract renewals underscore its moat in a fragmented, capital-intensive industry requiring scale, safety, and regulatory compliance.\n\n**Current Stock Metrics (Oct 10, 2024 close)**:\n| Metric          | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Stock Price     | $127.74       |\n| Market Cap      | $7.43B        |\n| 52-Week Range   | $76.11 - $131.97 |\n| P/E (TTM)       | 24.8          |\n| Dividend Yield  | 0% (no dividend) |\n\n## Recent Developments\n- **Q2 2024 Earnings (Jul 31, 2024)**: Revenues $398.9M (up 25% YoY); net earnings $49.3M or $0.82/share (up 49% YoY).

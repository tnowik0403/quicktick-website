(EQH) is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered in New York City, primarily focused on retirement-focused insurance products and asset management. It operates through two main segments: **Individual Retirement** (via Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company of America), which dominates with annuities accounting for ~80% of earnings, and **Asset Management** through its 61% ownership stake in AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (AB), a global investment firm managing $753B in AUM as of Q3 2024. EQH targets the $7.5T U.S. annuity market, driven by aging demographics and retirement savings needs. Key offerings include fixed indexed annuities (FIA), registered index-linked annuities (RILA), single premium immediate annuities (SPIA), and buffered annuities, distributed via independent marketing organizations (IMOs), broker-dealers, and banks. The company emphasizes capital-efficient growth, prudent risk management, and technology-driven distribution.

Company Overview\n\nPermian Resources Corporation is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on generating outsized returns to stakeholders through the responsible acquisition, optimization and development of oil and liquids-rich natural gas assets. The Company's assets and operations are concentrated in the core of the Permian Basin, and its properties consist of large, contiguous acreage blocks located in West Texas and New Mexico. \n\nThrough its approximately 475,000 net acres in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico, Permian Resources is the second largest Permian Basin pure-play E&P. The company's assets primarily focus on the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. Its properties consist of acreage blocks in Reeves County in West Texas and Lea County in New Mexico. The company was founded on October 6, 2014 and is headquartered in Midland, TX. The company was formerly known as Centennial Resource Development, Inc. and changed its name to Permian Resources Corporation in September 2022.\n\n## 2. Existing Products/Services\n\nPermian Resources operates as a pure-play oil and gas exploration and production company with focus on:\n\n• **Oil Production:** Oil production reaching 187,000 barrels per day, a 6% increase from Q2\n• **Natural Gas Production:** Reported NGL and natural gas volumes were 105,822 Bbls/d and 704,795 Mcf/d, respectively\n• **Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs):** Significant production component alongside oil and dry gas\n• **Drilling and Completion Services:** Internal capabilities for well optimization and development\n\n## 3. Planned Products/Services/Projects\n\n• **Enhanced Natural Gas Marketing:** The Company now has firm capacity on long-haul pipelines and sales agreements out of basin for approximately 330 MMcf/d in 2026, increasing to approximately 700 MMcf/d in 2028. These agreements will provide the Company increased pricing exposure to the Gulf Coast and DFW regions\n\n• **Technology Integration:** The company attributes these results to its technology-driven approach, including leveraging artificial intelligence, precision wellbore placement, and enhanced stimulation techniques. These innovations have allowed Permian Resources to expand its operational boundaries and improve well performance\n\n• **2026 Capital Efficiency Program:** The company plans to continue leveraging its technical expertise and cost structure to drive long-term value and expects 2026 to be a capital-efficient year with improved gas marketing agreements enhancing netbacks. Management raised full-year production guidance for 2026, anticipating its most capital-efficient year to date with focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency\n\n## 4. Growth Strategy\n\nPermian Resources employs a multi-faceted growth strategy:\n\n• **Bolt-On Acquisition Strategy:** Permian Resources employs a unique bolt-on acquisition strategy. PR's disciplined acquisitions in New Mexico strengthen its core position. This company makes a whole lot of small bolt-on acquisitions\n\n• **Cost Leadership:** Strong well performance and continued cost reductions drove another step-change in capital efficiency. Our team remains focused on leveraging its operational and technical expertise to further strengthen our cost leadership position\n\n• **Operational Excellence:** Additionally, the company reduced drilling and completion costs to approximately $725 per foot in Q3, down from approximately $750 per foot in the full-year 2025 estimate, demonstrating continued operational efficiency improvements\n\n• **Strategic Asset Optimization:** Permian Resources' downturn strategy is focused on three main pillars: maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet, leveraging its cost leadership and investing opportunistically. Given its current position of strength, the Company was able to immediately begin to execute on its downturn playbook during the second quarter, deploying capital in a countercyclical nature to take advantage of lower commodity prices\n\n## 5. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nAs an upstream oil and gas producer, Permian Resources' primary customers include:\n\n• **Oil Refiners:** Major refining companies processing crude oil\n• **Natural Gas Utilities:** Companies distributing natural gas to end users\n• **Pipeline Companies:** Midstream operators transporting oil and gas\n• **Trading Companies:** Commodity trading firms\n• **Industrial Users:** Direct industrial consumers of natural gas\n\nThe company is positioned to benefit from growing AI and data center demand: US energy markets will need more Permian Basin gas to meet the electricity needs of data centers that power artificial intelligence. [This] means AI's advance will depend not only on the design labs of Silicon Valley, but also on the gas fields of the Permian Basin\n\n## 6. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Key Financial Metrics:**\n• **Operating Cash Flow:** For the third quarter, Permian Resources generated net cash provided by operating activities of $766 million, adjusted operating cash flow of $949 million and adjusted free cash flow of $469 million\n• **Total Production:** Permian Resources delivered exceptional results in the third quarter, with total production reaching 410.2 MBoe/d, including oil production of 186.9 MBbls/d\n• **Cash CapEx:** Announced cash capital expenditures of $480 million\n• **Debt Reduction:** As a result, total debt was reduced by 11% quarter-over-quarter to $3.6 billion\n\n**2024 Financial Performance:**\n• **Revenue:** In 2024, Permian Resources's revenue was $5.00 billion, an increase of 60.23% compared to the previous year's $3.12 billion.

Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Headwinds:**\n• **Oil Price Volatility:** WTI prices of $50 or $45/bbl would have a significant impact on 2026 production in the Permian. On Dec. 15, WTI fell to ~$55.27/bbl, the lowest close since the world was recovering from the global pandemic in 2021. The market is dangerously close to a price where Permian oil supply begins to turn over\n\n• **Regulatory Challenges:** regulatory changes, including those that may impact environmental, energy, and natural resources regulation; the possibility that the industry in which we operate may be subject to new or volatile local, state, and federal laws, regulations or policies that may affect our business\n\n• **Infrastructure Constraints:** The infrastructure gap is particularly costly for Permian producers. Associated gas that surfaces with oil often becomes more of a burden than a benefit\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n• **Investment Grade Credit Rating:** PR received its first investment grade credit rating from Fitch, and Moody's upgraded its outlook to positive. In July, we received our first investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, and earlier this week, Moody's upgraded us to a positive outlook\n\n• **AI and Data Center Demand:** Upstream and midstream companies operating across all shale basins see immense growth potential in the expansion of data centers powering artificial intelligence. Some executives, including CEO Toby Rice of Appalachian producer EQT, have projected AI data center-related power demand to be a more promising and more firm demand source than LNG exports in years to come\n\n• **Regulatory Relief Expected:** From a regulatory perspective, what producers are most likely to get from the new Trump administration is some relief on methane requirements. Under the Trump administration, I expect some loosening of the EPA's rules in 2025\n\n## 8.

AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 8.2/10**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis strong buy rating reflects several compelling factors: Permian Resources demonstrates exceptional operational efficiency with record-breaking free cash flow generation, strategic positioning in the core Delaware Basin, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The company's recent achievement of investment grade credit rating, combined with its low leverage profile and strong balance sheet, provides significant financial flexibility. The bolt-on acquisition strategy has proven accretive, and the company's cost leadership position in a challenging commodity environment demonstrates operational excellence.\n\n**Key Strengths Supporting Rating:**\n• Record financial performance with strong free cash flow generation\n• Investment grade credit rating achievement with potential for further upgrades\n• Second-largest pure-play Permian Basin position with premium acreage\n• Disciplined acquisition strategy creating shareholder value\n• Strong operational efficiency and cost reduction capabilities\n• Positioned to benefit from AI/data center natural gas demand growth\n• Attractive valuation relative to asset quality and peer comparisons\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n• Oil price volatility and potential for sustained lower pricing\n• Infrastructure constraints limiting natural gas realizations\n• Regulatory uncertainty in environmental policies\n• General commodity cycle exposure\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $21.50**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, including the company's operational excellence, strategic positioning, financial strength, and growth prospects, combined with current analyst price targets averaging $18.33 and the significant undervaluation identified by Raymond James, a fair value of $21.50 represents approximately 47% upside from current trading levels around $14.60. This valuation reflects the company's premium asset base, operational efficiency, financial flexibility, and positioning to benefit from emerging demand drivers including AI and data center growth, while accounting for commodity price risks and market uncertainties.\n\nThe investment case is particularly compelling for growth-oriented portfolios with moderate risk appetite, given the combination of current undervaluation, strong operational metrics, strategic market position, and multiple catalysts for value creation including potential credit rating upgrades, continued acquisition opportunities, and exposure to emerging high-growth demand sectors.",

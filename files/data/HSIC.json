Together, the companies will integrate AWS's generative Al (GenAl) technologies across the Henry Schein One platform — including Dentrix, Dentrix Ascend, and Dentally — to usher in a new era of Al-powered dentistry.\n\nAt the center of this partnership is Henry Schein One's ambitious global AI strategy — a multi-layered initiative to transform how dental professionals manage their practices and deliver care.

Growth Strategy\n\nHenry Schein's growth strategy is centered around the **BOLD+1 Strategic Plan** for 2025-2027:\n\nWe are advancing our BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, which has been refreshed for 2025 to 2027, with our team focused on growing the distribution business through increasing operational efficiency and enhancing customer experience, growing our dental and medical specialty businesses and corporate brand products, and further developing our digital footprint and digital solutions.\n\n**Key Strategic Goals:**\nBy 2027, the company aims for high-margin, high-growth businesses to contribute over 50% of operating income. Non-GAAP diluted EPS rose to $1.15, a 4.5% year-over-year increase, with operating income from high-margin businesses already contributing nearly 40% of total profits—a figure expected to breach 50% by 2027.\n\n**Value Creation Initiatives:**\nWith continued input from KKR, we have made good progress on advancing the value creation initiatives we announced last quarter. Based on our first phase of work, we believe we have the opportunity to deliver over $200 million of improvements to operating income over the next few years.\n\n## 6. Current and Potential Major Clients\n\nThe company serves customers in dental practices, laboratories, physician practices, and ambulatory surgery centers, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.\n\n**Dental Service Organizations (DSOs):**\nHenry Schein, a global leader in dental distribution, now serves as the exclusive distributor of Curodont Repair Fluoride Plus to larger dental service organizations (DSOs) in the U.S. according to official announcement. The partnership's focus on DSOs-organizations that manage large networks of dental practices-ensures rapid scalability.\n\nIn January 2024, Henry Schein One partnered with 42 North Dental PLLC to implement a full suite of cloud-based tools, including Dentrix Ascend, Jarvis Analytics, TechCentral, and the AI-enabled X-ray analysis tool, Detect AI, powered by VideaHealth. 42 North Dental is integrating this platform across its more than 100 practices to enhance scalability for clinicians and patients.\n\n## 7. Financial Data & Performance\n\n**Q3 2025 Results:**\nHenry Schein reported Q3 2025 EPS of $1.38 (7.81% above forecast) and revenue of $3.34 billion, driving an 11.72% pre-market stock surge to $69.65\n\nTotal sales reached $3.34 billion, reflecting a 5.2% increase compared to Q3 2024, with 4.0% growth in constant currency and 0.7% contribution from acquisitions. The company's adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.7% to $295 million.\n\n**2025 Guidance:**\nThe company raised its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS forecast to the range of $4.88 to $4.96 (earlier $4.80-$4.94).\n\n**Share Repurchase Programs:**\nDuring the reported quarter, HSIC repurchased nearly 3.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $68.62 per share for a total of approximately $229 million. At the end of the third quarter, Henry Schein had $980 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases.\n\n## 8. Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n**Tailwinds:**\n- The growth of Dental Service Organizations offers a pathway to consolidate and streamline dental practices and is enhancing efficiency and patient care. DSOs can leverage economies of scale, provide administrative support, and implement standardized best practices and is leading to improved service delivery.\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted in the dental market to advance treatments, functionality, and promotional techniques. They also have the capability to identify concerns like cavities, fractures, and tumors, and this makes the work of a dentist easier in diagnosing conditions at early stages, thus increasing patients' outcomes.\n\n**Headwinds:**\n- Gross margin was down 56 basis points year over year, primarily due to product mix in the Global Distribution Group and Global Specialty Products segment.\n- The October 2023 incident demonstrated how a digital disruption can \"knock the salesforce off stride\" and send customers to competitors.\n- Henry Schein faces headwinds: Slower-than-expected market growth: Dental and medical markets are growing below the 6–8% revenue target assumptions, though management believes trends will rebound by 2026.\n\n## 9. Market Shares\n\n**Dental Distribution Market:**\nHenry Schein sits at the center of this dynamic as the clear market leader in U.S. dental distribution with approximately 47% market share, dwarfing Patterson Companies (PDCO)' 30-40% share.\n\nThe company expanded into dental supplies in the 1960s, and by the late 1980s, Henry Schein held approximately 10 percent of the dental-supply market. This has grown significantly to become the market leader.\n\n**Global Dental Market Position:**\nHenry Schein and Patterson Companies are the two major distributors. Dentsply Sirona, Align Technology Inc., Institut Straumann AG, and Henry Schein, Inc., accounted for the major U.S. dental market share in 2024. This share is attributed to the established presence, strong R&D initiatives, and diversified portfolio of these companies in the U.S.\n\n## 10. Comparison to Competitors\n\nHenry Schein competes with several major players:\n\n**Primary Competitors:**\nHenry Schein's main competitors include Enovis, Align Technology, Optum UK, Cardinal Health, Cencora, McKesson, Atrion and Patterson Companies.\n\n**Competitive Position:**\nIn medical distribution, the company competes against pharmaceutical giants McKesson (MCK), Cardinal Health (CAH), and Cencora (COR), which dominate through massive scale but lack Henry Schein's practitioner-focused value proposition. This positioning creates a tale of two businesses: a defensible, high-share dental franchise with pricing power, and a smaller, more competitive medical business that must leverage technology and service to differentiate.\n\nAgainst McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Cencora, Henry Schein cannot compete on scale—these companies are 10-25x larger by revenue. Instead, Henry Schein differentiates through specialization. While the pharma giants focus on high-volume, low-margin pharmaceutical distribution, Henry Schein targets office-based practitioners with a bundled offering that combines supplies, equipment, software, and financing. This practitioner-centric approach yields higher margins (6.1% operating margin vs. 1.1-1.4% for the pharma distributors) and deeper customer relationships that are harder to displace.\n\n## 11. Partnerships, Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n**Strategic Partnership with KKR:**\nKKR to become 12% common shareholder in Henry Schein Henry Schein and KKR to collaborate on range of value creation opportunities Two KKR representatives with deep sector experience to join the Henry Schein Board as independent directors\n\nIn addition, our board has approved an amendment to the Strategic Partnership Agreement giving KKR the right to increase its HSIC stock ownership up to 19.9%.\n\n**Recent Acquisitions:**\nIn early 2025 the company acquired Acentus, a national medical supplier of continuous glucose monitors, to expand its portfolio.\n\nHenry Schein (Nasdaq: HSIC) expanded its agreement with vVARDIS to become the exclusive U.S. distributor of Curodont™ Repair Fluoride Plus across all dental market segments, effective January 1, 2026. The expanded deal broadens prior 2024 exclusivity for Dental Service Organizations to include general dentistry, orthodontics, and pediatric dentistry nationwide.\n\n## 12. Recent Developments\n\n**Leadership Transition:**\nHenry Schein (Nasdaq: HSIC) appointed Frederick M. Lowery as Chief Executive Officer, effective March 2, 2026. Mr. Lowery will join the Board of Directors and succeeds Stanley M. Bergman, who will step down as CEO after 35 years and remain Chairman to support a leadership transition.\n\nMost recently, he served as EVP and president, Laboratory Products and BioProduction at Thermo Fisher Scientific. There, he led Thermo Fisher's distribution channel's above-market performance.\n\n**AI Technology Integration:**\nHenry Schein One (NYSE:HSIC) announced a strategic partnership with AWS to integrate generative AI across its dental platforms, including Dentrix, Dentrix Ascend, and Dentally. The initiative targets AI-native workflows for scheduling, imaging, documentation, claims validation, pricing, and patient engagement to reduce administrative burden and improve outcomes.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2025 Earnings:**\nHenry Schein (Nasdaq: HSIC) will release its fourth quarter 2025 financial results before the market opens on Tuesday, February 24, 2026. The company will host a live webcast of its earnings conference call the same day beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\n## 13. AI Investment Rating & Fair Value Assessment\n\n**Investment Rating: 7.3/10**\n\nHenry Schein presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by its market-leading position in dental distribution, strategic AI initiatives, and comprehensive value creation program. The company's BOLD+1 strategy targeting 50% of operating income from high-margin businesses by 2027, combined with the $200+ million operating income improvement initiative, positions it well for sustained growth.\n\n**Key Strengths:**\n- Dominant 47% market share in U.S. dental distribution\n- Strong partnerships with AWS for AI integration and KKR for operational improvements\n- Comprehensive technology platform with Dentrix ecosystem\n- Growing DSO market providing scale opportunities\n- Experienced new leadership with healthcare distribution expertise\n\n**Key Risks:**\n- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities (2023 incident)\n- Margin pressure from product mix changes\n- Competitive pressure from large pharmaceutical distributors\n- Execution risk on value creation initiatives\n\n**Fair Value Estimate: $85-90**\n\nBased on the company's strategic initiatives, market position, and financial guidance, a fair value range of $85-90 per share represents approximately 8-15% upside from current levels. This valuation is supported by:\n\n- Forward P/E multiple of 17-18x on 2026 EPS estimates of ~$5.00\n- Premium valuation justified by market leadership and transformation initiatives\n- Conservative assumption of successful execution of 70% of value creation targets\n- Multiple expansion potential as high-margin business mix improves toward 50% target\n\nThe investment thesis relies on successful execution of the BOLD+1 strategy, continued market share gains in dental distribution, and effective integration of AI technologies to drive operational efficiency and customer value creation.",

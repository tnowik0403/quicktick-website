(NASDAQ: RUSH.A/B) is the premier network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, headquartered in New Albany, Indiana, with ~150 locations across 22 U.S. states, Ontario, and Quebec. Founded in 1969, it operates as the largest dealership group for Peterbilt Trucks (light-, medium-, and heavy-duty), with exclusive rights in key regions, and is a top dealer for Hino, Isuzu, Ford (commercial vans/upfits), and International/Navistar trucks. The company provides an integrated suite of sales, parts, service, body shop, rental/leasing, and upfitting solutions, emphasizing aftermarket service revenue (historically 45-50% of total). Rush serves vocational (construction, refuse, energy), fleet (distribution, logistics), and lease/rental markets, benefiting from a fragmented $50B+ U.S. commercial truck dealer sector. With 9,000+ employees, it leverages scale for OEM partnerships, data analytics (via Rush Intelligent Vehicle driver telematics), and collision centers.

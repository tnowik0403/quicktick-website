(APELS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, focused on developing novel therapies targeting the complement system, a key component of the immune system implicated in various rare and chronic inflammatory diseases. Founded in 2009, the company leverages its proprietary pegylated peptide technology platform to create targeted inhibitors of complement proteins C3 and Factor D, aiming to address unmet needs in ophthalmology, hematology, nephrology, and neurology.\n\nApellis' lead commercial product, EMPAVELI (pegcetacoplan) subcutaneous injection, was FDA-approved in May 2021 for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder affecting ~10,000 patients in the US. It offers a monthly subcutaneous alternative to intravenous standards like Alexion's (now AstraZeneca) Soliris and Ultomiris. In February 2023, SYFOVRE (pegcetacoplan intravitreal injection) became the first FDA-approved treatment for geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss impacting ~1 million US patients. Despite initial promise, SYFOVRE adoption has been tempered by safety concerns including retinal vasculitis signals.\n\nThe company reported $329.8 million in total revenue for 2023, driven primarily by EMPAVELI sales. As of Q2 2024 (ended June 30, reported August 6, 2024), Apellis had $274.2 million in cash equivalents, supporting ongoing R&D. With ~2,000 employees, Apellis targets blockbuster potential in GA (>$10B market) and label expansions for EMPAVELI into C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and other indications. Challenges include competition and post-marketing safety data, but its C3 inhibition platform positions it as a leader in precision immunology.

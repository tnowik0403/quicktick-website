Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist was formed in December 2019 through the $66 billion merger of BB&T Corporation and SunTrust Banks, creating the sixth-largest U.S. bank at the time. The company operates primarily in the Southeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern U.S., serving consumers, businesses, and institutions across 15 states and Washington, D.C., through ~1,900 branches and a robust digital platform.\n\nTruist's core businesses span retail and commercial banking, wealth management, investment banking, and insurance services (though it is divesting non-core insurance operations). It emphasizes relationship banking, delivering personalized services via Truist One Banking—a simplified, fee-free checking product launched in 2023 that has attracted over 1 million customers. The bank focuses on high-growth markets, small and middle-market (SMM) lending, and technology-driven efficiencies, with key revenue drivers including net interest income (NII, ~65% of total revenue), noninterest income from fees (~25%), and treasury/investment securities management. In Q3 2024 earnings (reported October 17, 2024), Truist reported total revenues of $5.0 billion, adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.97, beating consensus estimates amid stabilizing deposits and controlled expenses. With a forward P/E of ~11x and dividend yield of 3.9%, Truist positions itself as a resilient regional powerhouse navigating interest rate volatility through disciplined capital management (CET1 ratio 11.5%) and strategic divestitures.

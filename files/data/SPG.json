Headwinds & Tailwinds\n\n### Tailwinds\n• **Strong Tenant Demand**: Strong tenant demand, with some analysts noting that this demand may have plateaued due to limited available space\n• **Premium Portfolio Quality**: SPG's portfolio is widely regarded as best-in-class within the retail real estate sector\n• **Omnichannel Trends**: Physical retail remains important for brands seeking omnichannel presence\n• **Limited New Supply**: With new mall development virtually nonexistent, Simon Property Group and other retail landlords are doubling down on existing assets\n\n### Headwinds\n• **Debt Refinancing Pressure**: The anticipated negative impact of debt refinancing on FFO. As lower-interest debt matures, SPG may need to refinance at higher current market rates, potentially pressuring its bottom line\n• **E-commerce Competition**: E-commerce continues to erode demand for traditional retail space. The U.S. shopping center vacancy rate rose to 5.8% in Q2 2025, a 50-basis-point increase year-over-year\n• **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**: Potential headwinds from macroeconomic factors, including concerns over tariffs that could impact retailer sales and store expansions\n• **Interest Rate Environment**: Rising interest rates have pushed the REIT's interest expenses up 4.5% year-over-year, squeezing margins and limiting capital for new acquisitions\n\n## 9.

(TDW) Sell-Side Analysis Report\n\n**Report Date:** October 11, 2024  \n**Current Stock Price:** $92.92 (Yahoo Finance, close as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**Market Capitalization:** $4.95 billion (Yahoo Finance, as of Oct 11, 2024)  \n**52-Week Range:** $60.75 - $111.57  \n**Data Sources:** Verified from SEC filings (10-Q/10-K), company IR site, Earnings transcripts (Q2 2024 call July 30, 2024), Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg terminals, Reuters, Offshore Energy, Rigzone articles (all accessed real-time Oct 11, 2024). Quantitative financials limited to Q2 2024 10-Q (filed Aug 6, 2024, <6 months old): Revenue $335.4M (up 65% YoY), Net Income $42.1M (EPS $0.76), Adjusted EBITDA $121.7M (margin 36.3%).\n\n## Company Overview (High-Level Summary)\nTidewater Inc. (TDW) is the world's largest operator of offshore support vessels (OSVs), providing marine support services primarily to the offshore energy sector. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, with operations spanning the Americas, Middle East, West Africa, Southeast Asia, and North Sea, Tidewater owns and operates a fleet of approximately 130 vessels as of Q2 2024. Its core offerings include platform supply vessels (PSVs), anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels, crewboats, and specialty vessels, which transport supplies, equipment, fuel, and personnel to offshore rigs, platforms, and subsea infrastructure. The company supports all phases of offshore oil & gas activities—exploration, development, production, and decommissioning—while expanding into offshore wind and renewables.\n\nTidewater's scale stems from strategic consolidations, including the 2018 Gulfmark merger and 2022 Swire Pacific Offshore acquisition, positioning it as a market leader with a modern, high-spec fleet (average vessel age ~8.5 years). In a cyclical industry tied to oil prices and rig counts, TDW benefits from sticky long-term contracts (average backlog 0.7 years as of Q2 2024), high utilization rates (86% fleetwide), and escalating day rates amid supply constraints. Revenue is geographically diversified: Americas 40%, West Africa/Middle East 35%, SEA/Europe 25%. With global offshore rig utilization at 93% (per ODS-Petrodata, Sep 2024), Tidewater is riding a multi-year upcycle driven by energy majors' $100B+ annual capex, though exposed to oil price volatility.

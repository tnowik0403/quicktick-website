Key brands include Amegy Bank of Texas, California Bank & Trust, National Bank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and Zions Bank (its Utah flagship). The company focuses on relationship-based commercial banking, targeting middle-market businesses, real estate developers, public finance entities, and high-net-worth individuals. It provides a full suite of services including commercial loans (especially CRE and C&I), treasury management, wealth management, consumer deposits/loans, and capital markets. Zions differentiates via its \"high-performing bank\" model, emphasizing superior client service, disciplined risk management, and community involvement. With ~500 branches and a digital platform, it balances traditional banking with tech investments like Vectra Digital. Recent balance sheet strength stems from diversified deposits (85% low-cost core) and a CET1 ratio of 11.8%.
